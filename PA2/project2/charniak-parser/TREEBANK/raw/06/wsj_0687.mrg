<s> Dennis Farney 's Oct. 13 page-one article `` River of Despair , '' about the poverty along the Mississippi , fanned childhood memories of when my parents were sharecroppers in southeastern Arkansas , only a few miles from the river . </s>
<s> Although we were white , the same economic factors affected us as affects the black people Mr. Farney writes about . </s>
<s> Fortunately , an aunt with a college degree bought a small farm and moved us 50 miles north to good schools and an environment that opened the world of opportunity for me as an eight-year-old . </s>
<s> Though I 've been blessed with academic degrees and some success in the materialistic world , I 've never forgotten or lost contact with those memories of the 1930s . </s>
<s> Most of the land in that and other parts of the Delta are now owned by second , third or fourth generations of the same families . </s>
<s> These are the families who used -- and sometime abused -- their sharecroppers , people who had no encouragement and little access to an education or training for a better life . </s>
<s> Following World War II , when one family with mechanized equipment could farm crops formerly requiring 20 families , the surplus people were dumped into the mainstream of society with no Social Security , no skills in the workplace , no hope for their future except welfare . </s>
<s> And today , many of their children , grandchildren and great-grandchildren remain on welfare . </s>
<s> In the meantime , the landowners continue receiving generous subsidies that began during New Deal days . </s>
<s> Or those who choose not to farm can lease their lands and crop allotments for handsome sums . </s>
<s> Farmers in the Midwest and other areas have suffered , but those along the Mississippi continue to prosper with holdings that were built with the sweat of men and women living in economic slavery . </s>
<s> And when they were no longer needed , they were turned loose unprepared to build lives of their own . </s>

<s> Because the cycle of poverty along the lower Mississippi goes back so many generations , breaking this cycle will be next to impossible . </s>
<s> Sadly , the cycle appears not as waves but as a downward spiral . </s>
<s> Yet the evidence that we have not hit bottom is found in the fact that we are not yet helping ourselves . </s>
<s> The people of the Delta are waiting for that big factory to open , river traffic to increase , government spending to fund job-training programs or public schools to educate apathetic students . </s>
<s> Because we refuse to face the tough answers , the questions continue as fodder for the commissions and committees , for the media and politicians . </s>
<s> Coffee-shop chatter does not lend itself to solving the problems of racism , teen pregnancy or lack of parental support or guidance . </s>
<s> Does the Delta deserve government help in attracting industry when the majority of residents , black and white , do not realize racism alienates potential employers ? </s>
<s> Should we focus on the region 's infant-mortality rate when the vocal right-wingers and the school boards , mayors and legislators prohibit schools from teaching the two ways -LRB- abstinence or contraceptives -RRB- of decreasing teen pregnancy ? </s>
<s> Delta problems are difficult , not impossible , to solve -- I am just not convinced that we are ready to solve them yet . </s>

<s> I would like to issue a challenge to corporate America . </s>
<s> The next time expansion plans are mentioned at the old company and somebody says , `` Aw heck , guys , nobody can do it like Japan or South Korea , '' I wish you would butt in and say , `` Hold it , fellas , why do n't we compare prices and use our own little Third World country . </s>
<s> We would even save on freight . '' </s>
<s> There is no mystery why the Delta originated `` Singin ' the Blues . '' </s>

<s> Your story is an insult to the citizens of the Mississippi Delta . </s>
<s> Many of the problems you presented exist in every part of this country . </s>
<s> Poverty is only two blocks from President Bush 's residence . </s>
<s> For years , we tried to ignore the problem of poverty , and now that it has gotten out of hand it 's a new crusade for the media and our Democratic Congress . </s>
<s> Nobody should have to live in such poor conditions as in `` Sugar Ditch , '' but when you travel to Washington , Boston , Chicago or New York , the same problems exist . </s>
<s> The only difference is , in those cities the poor are housed in high-rise-project apartments each consisting of one room , with rusty pipes called plumbing , rodents and cockroaches everywhere and nonworking elevators -- and with the building patrolled by gangs and drug dealers . </s>
<s> Many middle-class people would love free food , Medicaid insurance , utilities and rent . </s>
<s> Then maybe I could stay home and have seven children and watch Oprah Winfrey , like Beulah in the article , instead of having one child and working constantly just to stay above water , like so many families in this country . </s>
