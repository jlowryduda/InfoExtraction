<s> We are deeply disturbed that a recent editorial stated that the `` Americans With Disabilities Act of 1989 '' was `` crafted primarily by Democratic Senators Kennedy and Harkin '' with a premise `` based on the presumption that most Americans are hostile to the disabled ... . '' </s>
<s> Perhaps even more offensive is the statement , `` It is surprising that George Bush and the White House inner circle would ally themselves with this crabby philosophy . '' </s>
<s> This legislation was not drafted by a handful of Democratic `` do-gooders . '' </s>
<s> Quite the contrary -- it results from years of work by members of the National Council on the Handicapped , all appointed by President Reagan . </s>
<s> You depict the bill as something Democratic leaders `` hoodwinked '' the administration into endorsing . </s>
<s> The opposite is true : It 's the product of many meetings with administration officials , Senate staffers , advocates , and business and transportation officials . </s>
<s> Many congressmen are citing the compromise on the `` Americans With Disabilities Act of 1989 '' as a model for bipartisan deliberations . </s>
<s> Most National Council members are themselves disabled or are parents of children with disabilities . </s>
<s> We know firsthand the discrimination addressed by the act : to be told there 's no place for your child in school ; to spend lonely hours at home because there is no transportation for someone in a wheelchair ; to be denied employment because you are disabled . </s>
<s> Your editorial mockingly entitles this legislation the `` Lawyers ' Employment Act . '' </s>
<s> For the 43 million people with disabilities and their families , this legislation is the `` Emancipation Proclamation . '' </s>
