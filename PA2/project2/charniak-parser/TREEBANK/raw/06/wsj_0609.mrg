<s> President Bush insists it would be a great tool for curbing the budget deficit and slicing the lard out of government programs . </s>
<s> He wants it now . </s>
<s> Not so fast , says Rep. Mickey Edwards of Oklahoma , a fellow Republican . </s>
<s> `` I consider it one of the stupidest ideas of the 20th century , '' he says . </s>
<s> It 's the line-item veto , a procedure that would allow the president to kill individual items in a big spending bill passed by Congress without vetoing the entire bill . </s>
<s> Whatever one thinks of the idea , it 's far more than the budgetary gimmick it may seem at first glance . </s>
<s> Rather , it 's a device that could send shock waves through the president 's entire relationship with Democrats and Republicans alike in Congress , fundamentally enhance the power of the presidency and transform the way the government does its business . </s>
<s> President Bush badly wants a line-item veto and has long called for a law giving it to the president . </s>
<s> Now the White House is declaring that he might not rely on Congress -- which has n't shown any willingness to surrender such authority -- to pass the line-item veto law he seeks . </s>
<s> White House spokesmen last week said Mr. Bush is considering simply declaring that the Constitution gives him the power , exercising a line-item veto and inviting a court challenge to decide whether he has the right . </s>
<s> Although that may sound like an arcane maneuver of little interest outside Washington , it would set off a political earthquake . </s>
<s> `` The ramifications are enormous , '' says Rep. Don Edwards , a California Democrat who is a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee . </s>
<s> `` It 's a real face-to-face arm wrestling challenge to Congress . '' </s>
<s> White House aides know it 's a step that ca n't be taken lightly -- and for that reason , the president may back down from launching a test case this year . </s>
<s> Some senior advisers argue that with further fights over a capital-gains tax cut and a budget-reduction bill looming , Mr. Bush already has enough pending confrontations with Congress . </s>
<s> They prefer to put off the line-item veto until at least next year . </s>
<s> Still , Mr. Bush and some other aides are strongly drawn to the idea of trying out a line-item veto . </s>
<s> The issue arose last week when Vice President Dan Quayle told an audience in Chicago that Mr. Bush was looking for a test case . </s>
<s> White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater confirmed that Mr. Bush was interested in the idea , but cautioned that there was n't a firm decision to try it . </s>
<s> Mr. Bush , former President Reagan and a host of conservative activists have been arguing that a line-item veto would go a long way in restoring discipline to the budget process . </s>
<s> They maintain that a president needs the ability to surgically remove pork-barrel spending projects that are attached to big omnibus spending bills . </s>
<s> Those bills ca n't easily be vetoed in their entirety because they often are needed to keep the government operating . </s>
<s> Conservatives note that 43 governors have the line-item veto to use on state budgets . </s>
<s> More provocatively , some conservative legal theorists have begun arguing that Mr. Bush does n't need to wait for a law giving him the veto because the power already is implicit in the Constitution . </s>
<s> They base their argument on a clause buried in Article I , Section 7 , of the Constitution that states : `` Every order , resolution , or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary -LRB- except on a question of adjournment -RRB- shall be presented to the President of the United States ; and before the same shall take effect , shall be approved by him or ... disapproved by him ... . '' </s>
<s> This clause , they argue , is designed to go beyond an earlier clause specifying that the president can veto a `` bill , '' and is broad enough to allow him to strike out items and riders within bills . </s>
<s> Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole -LRB- R. , Kan. -RRB- , for one , accepts this argument and earlier this year publicly urged Mr. Bush `` to use the line-item veto and allow the courts to decide whether or not it is constitutional . '' </s>
<s> There 's little doubt that such a move would be immediately challenged in court -- and that it would quickly make its way to the Supreme Court to be ultimately resolved . </s>
<s> `` It 's a major issue , and they would n't want to leave it at a lower level , '' says Stephen Glazier , a New York attorney whose writings have been instrumental in pushing the idea that a president already has a line-item veto . </s>
<s> Rep. Edwards , the California Democrat , is one who pledges that he would immediately challenge Mr. Bush in the courts , arguing a line-item veto would expand a president 's powers far beyond anything the framers of the Constitution had in mind . </s>
<s> `` It puts this president in the legislative business , '' he declares . </s>
<s> `` That 's not what our fathers had in mind . '' </s>
<s> In addition to giving a president powers to rewrite spending bills meant to be written in Congress , Rep. Edwards argues , a line-item veto would allow the chief executive to blackmail lawmakers . </s>
<s> He notes that , as a lawmaker from the San Francisco area , he fights each year to preserve federal funds for the Bay Area Rapid Transit system . </s>
<s> If a president had a line-item veto and wanted to force him to support a controversial foreign-policy initiative , Rep. Edwards says , the president could call and declare that he would single-handedly kill the BART funds unless the congressman `` shapes up '' on the foreign-policy issue . </s>
<s> Proponents maintain that a president would choose to use a line-item veto more judiciously than that . </s>
<s> But there may be another problem with the device : Despite all the political angst it would cause , it might n't be effective in cutting the deficit . </s>
<s> Big chunks of the government budget , like the entitlement programs of Social Security and Medicare , would n't be affected . </s>
<s> Governors have found that they have to use the device sparingly to maintain political comity . </s>
<s> And it is n't even clear that some pork-barrel projects can be hit with a line-item veto because they tend to be listed in informal conference reports accompanying spending bills rather than in the official bills themselves . </s>
<s> Still , proponents contend that the veto would have what Mr. Glazier calls an important `` chilling effect '' on all manner of appropriations bills . </s>
<s> Lawmakers , they say , would avoid putting many spending projects into legislation in the first place for fear of the embarrassment of having them singled out for a line-item veto later . </s>
<s> Whatever the outcome of a test case , President Bush would have to move cautiously becase the very attempt would `` antagonize not just Democrats but Republicans , '' says Louis Fisher , a scholar at the Congressional Research Service who specializes in executive-legislative relations . </s>
<s> Republicans have as much interest as Democrats in `` the way the system works , '' he notes . </s>
<s> Indeed , although a majority of Republican lawmakers favor a line-item veto , some , ranging from liberal Oregon Sen. Mark Hatfield to conservative Rep. Edwards are opposed . </s>
<s> Rep. Edwards voices the traditional conservative view that it 's a mistake to put too much power in the hands of a single person . </s>
<s> Conservatives pushing for a line-item veto now , he notes , may regret it later : `` Sometime , you 're going to have a Democratic president again '' who 'll use his expanded powers against those very same conservatives . </s>
<s> `` Every order , resolution , or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary -LRB- except on a question of adjournment -RRB- shall be presented to the President of the United States ; and before the same shall take effect , shall be approved by him , or being disapproved by him , shall be repassed by two-thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives , according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill .
