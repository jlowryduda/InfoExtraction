<s> Dentsu Inc. , the world 's largest advertising agency on the strength of its dominance in the Japanese market , is setting its sights on overseas expansion . </s>
<s> Last year , Dentsu started HDM , a joint network with U.S. ad agency Young & Rubicam and Eurocom of France . </s>
<s> A few months ago , Dentsu acquired 69 % of Australian agency Fortune Communication Holdings Ltd. for 5.9 million Australian dollars -LRB- US$ 4.6 million -RRB- . </s>
<s> Dentsu has U.S. subsidiaries , but they keep low profiles . </s>
<s> Now , the giant marketing company , which holds 25 % of Japan 's 4.4 trillion yen -LRB- $ 30.96 billion -RRB- advertising industry , is considering the acquisition of an advertising network in the U.S. or Europe . </s>
<s> What is driving Dentsu 's international expansion largely is the need to keep up with its Japanese clients as they grow in the U.S. and Europe . </s>
<s> `` If we do n't do something ... we wo n't be able to catch up with demand , '' says a Dentsu spokesman . </s>
<s> `` Our president said acquisition is an effective method . '' </s>
<s> Last year , Dentsu 's foreign business accounted for less than 10 % of total billings , but the company is aiming at 20 % in the near future . </s>
<s> So far , it appears cautious about taking the big step . </s>
<s> For example , the spokesman says Dentsu has been approached by banks and securities companies a number of times to invest in the troubled British marketing group Saatchi & Saatchi PLC . </s>
<s> But he said Dentsu has n't looked seriously at Saatchi . </s>
<s> Though Dentsu says it has no concrete acquisition plans or deadlines , it is laying the groundwork for international growth . </s>
<s> It is setting up a special team in charge of international markets and training workers to do business abroad . </s>
<s> For the year ended March 31 , Dentsu sales rose 19 % to $ 8.9 billion from $ 7.5 billion , and net income jumped 59 % to $ 102 million from $ 64 million . </s>
<s> Dentsu 's billings last year were larger than those of Young & Rubicam , the world 's second-largest ad agency , according to a survey by the publication Advertising Age . </s>
<s> But success overseas in unfamiliar markets could be trickier than for other industries such as manufacturers . </s>
<s> On its own , Dentsu 's muscle in Japan may count for little in major foreign markets when seeking non-Japanese clients . </s>
<s> Thus , an acquisition may prove the necessary course . </s>
<s> But Japanese agencies are cautious about expanding abroad because client relationships are different . </s>
<s> Japanese agencies do business with rival clients in the same industry , a practice `` that would be unacceptable by traditional Western conflict rules , '' says Roy Warman , the London chief executive of Saatchi & Saatchi 's communications division . </s>
<s> Although acquiring a foreign company would expand Japanese advertising agencies ' business to foreign clients , many clients would also be Japanese companies expanding overseas , says the Dentsu spokesman . </s>
<s> But the different business system would make it hard for Dentsu to provide these Japanese companies the same kind of services they do in Japan . </s>
