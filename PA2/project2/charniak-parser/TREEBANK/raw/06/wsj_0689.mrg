<s> Wanted : An investment that 's as simple and secure as a certificate of deposit but offers a return worth getting excited about . </s>
<s> With $ 150 billion of CDs maturing this month , a lot of people have been scouring the financial landscape for just such an investment . </s>
<s> In April , when many of them bought their CDs , six-month certificates were yielding more than 9 % ; investors willing to look could find double-digit yields at some banks and thrifts . </s>
<s> Now , the nationwide average yield on a six-month CD is just under 8 % , and 8.5 % is about the best around . </s>
<s> But investors looking for alternatives are n't finding it easy . </s>
<s> Yields on most fixed-income securities are lower than several months ago . </s>
<s> And the stock market 's recent gyrations are a painful reminder of the dangers there . </s>
<s> `` If you 're looking for a significantly higher yield with the same level of risk as a CD , you 're not going to find it , '' says Washington financial planner Dennis M. Gurtz . </s>
<s> There are , however , some alternatives that income-oriented investors should consider , investment advisers say . </s>
<s> Short-term municipal bonds , bond funds and tax-deferred annuities are some of the choices they mention -- and not just as a way to get a higher return . </s>
<s> In particular , advisers say , investors may want to look at securities that reduce the risk that CD holders are confronting right now , of having to reinvest the proceeds of maturing short-term certificates at lower rates . </s>
<s> A mix of CDs and other holdings may make the most sense . </s>
<s> `` People should remember their money is n't all or nothing -- they do n't need to be shopping for the one interest-rate-type investment and putting all their money in it , '' says Bethesda , Md. , adviser Karen Schaeffer . </s>
<s> Here 's a look at some of the alternatives : </s>
<s> SHORT-TERM MUNICIPALS : </s>
<s> Investors with a heavy tax load should take out their calculators . </s>
<s> Yields on municipal bonds can be higher than after-tax yields on CDs for maturities of perhaps one to five years . </s>
<s> That 's because municipal-bond interest is exempt from federal income tax -- and from state and local taxes too , for in-state investors . </s>
<s> For an investor paying tax at a 33 % rate , a seemingly puny 6 % yield on a one-year muni is equivalent to a taxable 9 % . </s>
<s> Rates approach 6.5 % on five-year municipals . </s>
<s> Some of the more cautious CD holders might like `` pre-refunded '' municipals . </s>
<s> These securities get top credit ratings because the issuers have put aside U.S. bonds that will be sold to pay off holders when the municipals are retired . </s>
<s> `` It 's a no-brainer : You do n't have to worry about diversification ; you do n't have to worry about quality , '' says Steven J. Hueglin , executive vice president of the New York bond firm of Gabriele , Hueglin & Cashman Inc . </s>
<s> Consider a `` laddered '' bond portfolio , with issues maturing in , say , 1992 , 1993 and 1994 , advises Malcolm A. Makin , a Westerly , R.I. , financial planner . </s>
<s> The idea is to have money rolling over each year at prevailing interest rates . </s>
<s> BOND FUNDS : </s>
<s> Bond mutual funds offer diversification and are easy to buy and sell . </s>
<s> That makes them a reasonable option for investors who will accept some risk of price fluctuation in order to make a bet that interest rates will decline over the next year or so . </s>
<s> Buyers can look forward to double-digit annual returns if they are right . </s>
<s> But they will have disappointing returns or even losses if interest rates rise instead . </s>
<s> Bond resale prices , and thus fund share prices , move in the opposite direction from rates . </s>
<s> The price movements get bigger as the maturity of the securities lengthens . </s>
<s> Consider , for instance , two bond funds from Vanguard Group of Investment Cos. that were both yielding 8.6 % on a recent day . </s>
<s> The Short Term Bond Fund , with an average maturity of 2 1\/2 years , would deliver a total return for one year of about 10.6 % if rates drop one percentage point and a one-year return of about 6.6 % if rates rise by the same amount . </s>
<s> But , in the same circumstances , the returns would be a more extreme 14.6 % and 2.6 % for the Vanguard Bond Market Fund , with its 12 1\/2-year average maturity . </s>
<s> `` You get equity-like returns '' from bonds if you guess right on rates , says James E. Wilson , a Columbia , S.C. , planner . </s>
<s> If interest rates do n't change , bond fund investors ' returns will be about equal to the funds ' current yields . </s>
<s> DEFERRED ANNUITIES : </s>
<s> These insurance company contracts feature some of the same tax benefits and restrictions as non-deductible individual retirement accounts : Investment gains are compounded without tax consequences until money is withdrawn , but a 10 % penalty tax is imposed on withdrawals made before age 59 1\/2 . </s>
<s> Aimed specifically at CD holders are so-called CD-type annuities , or certificates of annuity . </s>
<s> An interest rate is guaranteed for between one and seven years , after which holders get 30 days to choose another guarantee period or to switch to another insurer 's contract without the surrender charges that are common to annuities . </s>
<s> Some current rates exceed those on CDs . </s>
<s> For instance , a CD-type annuity from North American Co. for Life & Health Insurance , Chicago , offers 8.8 % interest for one year or a 9 % rate for two years . </s>
<s> Annuities are rarely a good idea at age 35 because of the withdrawal restrictions . </s>
<s> But at age 55 , `` they may be a great deal , '' says Mr. Wilson , the Columbia , S.C. , planner . </s>
<s> MONEY MARKET FUNDS : </s>
<s> That 's right , money market mutual funds . </s>
<s> The conventional wisdom is to go into money funds when rates are rising and shift out at times such as the present , when rates seem headed down . </s>
<s> With average maturities of a month or so , money funds offer fixed share prices and floating returns that track market interest rates , with a slight lag . </s>
<s> Still , today 's highest-yielding money funds may beat CDs over the next year even if rates fall , says Guy Witman , an editor of the Bond Market Advisor newsletter in Atlanta . </s>
<s> That 's because top-yielding funds currently offer yields almost 1 1\/2 percentage points above the average CD yield . </s>
<s> Mr. Witman likes the Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar Money Market Fund , with a seven-day compound yield just under 9.5 % . </s>
<s> A new fund , its operating expenses are being temporarily subsidized by the sponsor . </s>
<s> Try combining a money fund and an intermediate-term bond fund as a low-risk bet on falling rates , suggests Back Bay Advisors Inc. , a mutual fund unit of New England Insurance Co . </s>
<s> If rates unexpectedly rise , the increasing return on the money fund will partly offset the lower-than-expected return from the bond fund . </s>
