<s> Federal drug regulators , concerned over British reports that diabetics have died after shifting from animal to human-based insulin , say they are considering a study to see if similar deaths have occurred here . </s>
<s> The United Kingdom reports came from Dr. Patrick Toseland , head of clinical chemistry at Guy 's Hospital in London . </s>
<s> In a telephone interview Friday , Dr. Toseland said the number of sudden , unexplained deaths of diabetics he had seen this year was 17 compared with just two in 1985 . </s>
<s> At least six of the deaths occurred among relatively young diabetics who had switched from animal to human insulin within the past year , he said . </s>
<s> Dr. Solomon Sobel , director of metabolism and endrocrine drug products for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , said FDA officials have discussed Dr. Toseland 's findings `` fairly intensively . '' </s>
<s> While there have been no reports of similar sudden unexplained deaths among diabetics in the U.S. , Dr. Sobel said the FDA plans to examine Dr. Toseland 's evidence and is considering its own study here . </s>
<s> Dr. Toseland , a toxicologist , said he was preparing an article for a British forensic medical journal raising the possibility that the deaths may have occurred after human insulin blunted critical warning signs indicating hypoglycemia , or low blood sugar , which can kill diabetics . </s>
<s> The usual warning signs of hypoglycemia include sweating , anxiety and cramps . </s>
<s> With proper warning , diabetics can easily raise their blood sugar to safe levels by eating sugar or sugary food . </s>
<s> `` The anecdotal data certainly shows that some of the people were not aware of the rapid onset of hypoglycemia , '' Dr. Toseland said . </s>
<s> At the U.S. National Institutes of Health , Dr. Robert E. Silverman , chief of the diabetes program branch , said no evidence of unexpected deaths from hypoglycemia had shown up in a study of 1,500 diabetics that has been under way at NIH for five years . </s>
<s> However , he said officials conducting the study had n't been looking for signs of problems related to hypoglycemia unawareness . </s>
<s> `` We are now monitoring for it much more closely , '' he said . </s>
<s> `` We do know there are slight differences in the way human and animal insulins drive down blood sugar , '' Dr. Sobel said . </s>
<s> The human-based drug starts the blood sugar dropping sooner and drives it down faster , he said . </s>
<s> `` But we do n't believe there is enough of a difference to be clinically significant , '' Dr. Sobel said . </s>
<s> Reports of Dr. Toseland 's findings in the British press have triggered widespread concern among diabetics there . </s>
<s> Both the British Diabetic Association and the Committee on Safety in Medicines -- Britain 's equivalent of the U.S. FDA -- recently issued statements noting the lack of hard scientific evidence to support Dr. Toseland 's findings . </s>
<s> On Friday , the American Diabetes Association issued a similar statement urging the six million U.S. diabetics not to overreact to the British report . </s>
<s> `` A loss of the warning symptoms of hypoglycemia is a complex problem that is very unlikely to be due simply to the type of insulin used , '' the American association said . </s>
<s> The FDA already requires drug manufacturers to include warnings with insulin products that symptoms of hypoglycemia are less pronounced with human insulin than with animal-based products . </s>
<s> Eli Lilly & Co. , the Indianapolis-based drug manufacturer , dominates the U.S. human insulin market with its product known as Humulin . </s>
<s> Lilly is building plants to make the insulin in Indianapolis and Fagershein , France . </s>
<s> In its latest annual report , Lilly said Humulin sales have shown `` excellent growth . '' </s>
<s> Lilly officials said they had seen reports of hypoglycemic unawareness among some patients making the shift from animal to human insulin , but did n't know if the problem had caused any deaths . </s>
<s> Dr. Leigh Thompson , a Lilly group vice president , said the company 's clinical trials of both its animal and human-based insulins indicated no difference in the level of hypoglycemia between users of either product . </s>
<s> Dr. Toseland said most of the British diabetics who died had been taking a human-based insulin made by Novo\/Nordisk , a Danish manufacturer . </s>
<s> None of the diabetics were using Lilly 's insulin . </s>
