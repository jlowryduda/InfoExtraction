<s> Whittle Communications L.P. , which for months has fought a public relations battle with education leaders , said it has signed 500 schools in 24 states to subscribe to the controversial Channel One news program and its sister programs . </s>
<s> Channel One , a satellite-delivered daily program supported by advertising , is scheduled to be launched next March . </s>
<s> Whittle said its field staff signed up the 500 schools in 238 school districts after only eight weeks and company executives now expect to reach their start-up goal of 1,000 schools before the end of this year . </s>
<s> Christopher Whittle , chairman of the Knoxville , Tenn. , media company that is 50 % owned by Time Warner Inc. , said that by December 1990 he expects to have Channel One installed in about 8,000 schools with a potential audience of six million . </s>
<s> Installation of the TV system , which includes providing free 19-inch TV sets in classrooms , begins in January . </s>
<s> `` What we 've done in eight weeks shows we wo n't have enormous difficulties getting to the place we want to be , '' said Mr. Whittle . </s>
<s> He said his sales force is signing up schools at the rate of 25 a day . </s>
<s> In California and New York , state officials have opposed Channel One . </s>
<s> Mr. Whittle said private and parochial schools in both states will be canvassed to see if they are interested in getting the programs . </s>
<s> Subscribing schools get the 12-minute daily Channel One news program , whose four 30-second TV ads during each show have drawn protests from educators . </s>
<s> Subscribers also get the Classroom Channel , which will feature ad-free educational programming similar to some public-TV shows , and the Educator 's Channel , which will offer instructional programming for teachers and school administrators and will be supported by advertising . </s>
<s> Whittle has met some resistance . </s>
<s> The Educational Network , as Mr. Whittle has named the three programs , has been offered to 1,290 school districts and Whittle continues to negotiate with 919 districts . </s>
<s> About 10 % of the school districts approached have rejected the network . </s>
<s> Mr. Whittle said that so far , three of the six schools that carried the program in a five-week test last spring have subscribed to the program . </s>
<s> One of the test schools , Withrow High School in Cincinnati , rejected the project . </s>
<s> John Bruner , associate director of communications for Cincinnati Public Schools , said Channel One was rejected because students watching the program did n't fare particularly better on a 28-question current events quiz than a control school without the program and school absences were almost unchanged during the period when the program was being aired . </s>
<s> `` The number of correct responses was 45 % on the test and school absences did n't change much , '' said Mr. Bruner . </s>
<s> `` The pilot program was received well -LRB- by teachers and students -RRB- , but there was n't reason enough to sign up . </s>
<s> We even invited the public to stop by and see the program , but there was n't much interest . '' </s>
<s> Advertisers are showing interest . </s>
<s> Last month , Whittle announced it had sold $ 150 million in advertising time on the network to national advertisers . </s>
<s> Mr. Whittle Friday said several more advertisers have been added . </s>
<s> Whittle is spending $ 150 million initially to launch the network . </s>
<s> Installation of satellite dishes , TVs and videocassette equipment will cost the company about $ 20,000 per school , Mr. Whittle said . </s>
