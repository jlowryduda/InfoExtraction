<s> The head of the nation 's largest car-dealers group is telling dealers to `` just say no '' when auto makers pressure them to stockpile cars on their lots . </s>
<s> In an open letter that will run today in the trade journal Automotive News , Ron Tonkin , president of the National Car Dealers Association , says dealers should cut their inventories to no more than half the level traditionally considered desirable . </s>
<s> Mr. Tonkin , who has been feuding with the Big Three since he took office earlier this year , said that with half of the nation 's dealers losing money or breaking even , it was time for `` emergency action . '' </s>
<s> U.S. car dealers had an average of 59 days ' supply of cars in their lots at the end of September , according to Ward 's Automotive Reports . </s>
<s> But Mr. Tonkin said dealers should slash stocks to between 15 and 30 days to reduce the costs of financing inventory . </s>
<s> His message is getting a chilly reception in Detroit , where the Big Three auto makers are already being forced to close plants because of soft sales and reduced dealer orders . </s>
<s> Even before Mr. Tonkin 's broadside , some large dealers said they were cutting inventories . </s>
<s> Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. representatives criticized Mr. Tonkin 's plan as unworkable . </s>
<s> It `` is going to sound neat to the dealer except when his 15-day car supply does n't include the bright red one that the lady wants to buy and she goes up the street to buy one , '' a Chrysler spokesman said . </s>
