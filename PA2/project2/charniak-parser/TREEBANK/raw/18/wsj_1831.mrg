<s> Michelle Pfeiffer ca n't chew gum and sing at the same time . </s>
<s> But on the evidence of `` The Fabulous Baker Boys , '' that may be the only thing she ca n't do , at least when she 's acting in movies . </s>
<s> As the tough , slinky lounge chanteuse in `` The Fabulous Baker Boys , '' Ms. Pfeiffer sings for herself , and more than passably well . </s>
<s> Her Susie Diamond handles a song the way the greats do , like she 's hearing the way it should sound inside her head and she 's concentrating on matching that internal tone . </s>
<s> Yet her intensity stops and starts with the music . </s>
<s> When she is n't performing for an audience , she prepares for a song by removing the wad of gum from her mouth , and indicates that she 's finished by sticking the gum back in . </s>
<s> Like almost everything in this wonderfully romantic and edgy movie , Ms. Pfeiffer 's Susie seems like someone you 've seen before , in numerous show-biz stories -LRB- even her name , Susie Diamond , sounds like a character Marilyn Monroe must have played -RRB- . </s>
<s> Yet nothing about `` Baker Boys , '' and certainly nothing about Ms. Pfeiffer , really is like something from the video vault . </s>
<s> Steve Kloves , the young writer and director -LRB- he is n't yet 30 -RRB- , has only one produced picture to his credit ; he wrote the screenplay for `` Racing With the Moon , '' a lovely coming-of-age picture set in the '40s . </s>
<s> Both movies are infused with the nostalgic sensibility of someone much older , someone who does n't dismiss dreams , but who also has enough experience to see his limits . </s>
<s> However , Mr. Kloves directs his own material without sentimentality and at its own eccentric pace ; `` Baker Boys '' is both bluesy and funny . </s>
<s> He 's put a fresh spin on material that could come off terribly cliched ; for example , the way Susie wows an audience the first time she sings with the Baker Boys . </s>
<s> Of course , it does n't hurt that Mr. Kloves has made up for his lack of experience behind the camera with technicians who know exactly what they 're doing . </s>
<s> Much of the picture 's sensuality emerges from cinematographer Michael Ballhaus 's slyly seductive lens work . </s>
<s> After working for years with Werner Rainer Fassbinder , the late German director , and more recently with Martin Scorsese -LRB- `` After Hours , '' `` The Color of Money , '' `` The Last Temptation of Christ '' -RRB- , Mr. Ballhaus has developed a distinctively fluid style . </s>
<s> And Dave Grusin 's witty score embraces the banal requirements of banquet-hall musicianship -LRB- `` Feelings '' is a must -RRB- without condescension . </s>
<s> Though Ms. Pfeiffer has the flashy part -- she gets the best comic bits and to wear glamorous dresses and spiked heels the boys are pretty great , too . </s>
<s> What seemed like a good idea , to cast the Bridges brothers -LRB- Jeff and Beau -RRB- as the Baker brothers , actually turned out to be a good idea . </s>
<s> Anyone who 's tried to appear `` natural '' in front of a camera knows that it 's much more natural to end up looking like a stiff . </s>
<s> So it 's quite possible that the terrific play between the brothers is n't natural at all , that Jeff and Beau had to work like crazy to make their brotherly love -- and resentment and frustration and rage -- seem so very real . </s>
<s> When the movie opens the Baker brothers are doing what they 've done for 15 years professionally , and twice as long as that for themselves : They 're playing proficient piano , face-to-face , on twin pianos . </s>
<s> They 're small time in the small time-hotels -LRB- not the best ones -RRB- and restaurants in Seattle . </s>
<s> Yet they do n't disparage their audiences by disparaging their act . </s>
<s> They wear tuxedos most nights , unless circumstances -LRB- a regular gig at a `` tropical '' lounge , for example -RRB- require them to wear special costumes , like Hawaiian shirts . </s>
<s> Plump Beau , looking eager to please with his arched eyebrows and round face , plays the older brother , Frank . </s>
<s> Frank plans the program , takes care of business , and approaches the work like any other job . </s>
<s> He 's even able to think of a job that takes him out of the house 300 nights a week as an ordinary job . </s>
<s> He 's got a wife and two kids and a house in the suburbs ; the audience sees only the house , and only near the end of the movie . </s>
<s> Frank grovels a little for the bookers , probably no more or less than he would have to if he worked for a big corporation . </s>
<s> On his off-hours he wears cardigan sweaters . </s>
<s> Jeff Bridges is the younger brother , Jack , who fancies himself the rebellious artist ; he lives in a loft with his sick dog and the occasional visit from the little girl upstairs , who climbs down the fire escape . </s>
<s> Yet Jack 's the one who can remember every dive they ever played , and when , and he dutifully shows up for work night after night -LRB- he consoles himself with booze and by showing up at the last minute -RRB- . </s>
<s> Looking leaner than he has in a while , the younger Mr. Bridges 's Jack is sexy and cynical and a far sadder case than Frank , who 's managed to chisel his dreams to fit reality without feeling too cheated . </s>
<s> He can live with little pleasures . </s>
<s> Mr. Kloves has put together some priceless moments . </s>
<s> These include Jennifer Tilly 's audition to be the Baker Boys ' girl singer . </s>
<s> Ms. Tilly of the tweety-bird voice showed great comic promise during her stint as the mobster 's girlfriend on the television show , `` Hill Street Blues . '' </s>
<s> Here she delivers , especially during her enthusiastically awful rendition of the `` Candy Man , '' which she sings while prancing around in a little cotton candy pink angora sweater that could n't be more perfect . </s>
<s> -LRB- It matches her voice . -RRB- </s>
<s> And Ms. Pfeiffer 's particular version of `` Making Whoopee '' -- and the way Mr. Ballhaus photographs her , from the tips of her red high heels right up her clingy red velvet dress -- might make you think of Marilyn Monroe if Ms. Pfeiffer had n't gone and become a star in her own right . </s>
<s> VIDEO TIP : </s>
<s> If you 'd like to see the first time Michelle Pfeiffer sang on screen , and you have a lot of patience , take a look at `` Grease 2 . '' </s>
<s> You 'll find her there . </s>
<s> Better yet , check out the emergence of her comic persona in `` Married to the Mob , '' Jonathan Demme 's delightful Mafia comedy . </s>
