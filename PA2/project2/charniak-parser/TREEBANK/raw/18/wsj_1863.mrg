<s> Program traders were buying and selling at full steam Monday , the first trading session after the stock market 's 190.58-point plunge Friday . </s>
<s> They accounted for a hefty 16 % of New York Stock Exchange volume Monday , the fourth busiest session ever . </s>
<s> On Friday , 13 % of volume was in computer-guided program trades . </s>
<s> In August , by contrast , program trading averaged 10.3 % of daily Big Board turnover . </s>
<s> Program traders were publicly castigated following the 508-point crash Oct. 19 , 1987 , and a number of brokerage firms pulled back from using this strategy for a while . </s>
<s> But as the outcry faded by the spring of 1988 , they resumed . </s>
<s> Some observers thought that after Friday 's sharp drop , the firms would rein in their program traders to avoid stoking more controversy . </s>
<s> But the statistics released yesterday show the firms did nothing of the sort . </s>
<s> One reason , they said , was that the official reports on the 1987 crash exonerated program trading as a cause . </s>
<s> Stock-index arbitrage is the most controversial form of program trading because it accelerates market moves , if not actually causing them . </s>
<s> In it , traders buy or sell stocks and offset those positions in stock-index futures contracts to profit from fleeting price discrepancies . </s>
<s> Under the exchange 's definitions , program trading also describes a number of other strategies that , in the opinion of some traders , do n't cause big swings in the market . </s>
<s> The Big Board 's disclosure of program trading activity on these two days was unusual . </s>
<s> Though it collects such data daily , its monthly reports on program trading usually come out about three weeks after each month ends . </s>
<s> The September figures are due to be released this week . </s>
<s> The Big Board declined to name the Wall Street firms involved in the activity Friday and Monday , or the type of strategies used . </s>
<s> But traders on the exchange floor , who can observe the computer-guided trading activity on monitor screens , said most of the top program-trading firms were active both days . </s>
<s> Through August , the top five program trading firms in volume were Morgan Stanley & Co. , Kidder , Peabody & Co. , Merrill Lynch & Co. , PaineWebber Group Inc. and Salomon Brothers Inc . </s>
<s> Though brokerage officials defended their use of program trading , one sign of what an issue it remains was that few executives would comment on the record . </s>
<s> Besides reciting the pardon for program trading contained in the Brady Commission report , they said stock-index arbitrage was actually needed Monday to restore the markets ' equilibrium . </s>
<s> On Friday , the stock-index futures market was unhinged from the stock market when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange halted trading in Standard & Poor 's 500 futures contract -- a `` circuit breaker '' procedure instituted after the 1987 crash and implemented for the first time . </s>
<s> Futures trading resumed a half-hour later , but the session ended shortly thereafter , leaving the stock market set up for more sell programs , traders said . </s>
<s> By Monday morning , they said , stock-index arbitrage sell programs helped re-establish the link between stocks and futures . </s>
<s> But stunning volatility was produced in the process . </s>
<s> The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged a breathtaking 63.52 points in the first 40 minutes of trading Monday as stock-index arbitrage sell programs kicked in . </s>
<s> At about 10:10 a.m. EDT , the market abruptly turned upward on stock-index arbitrage buy programs . </s>
<s> By day 's end , the Dow industrials had rebounded 88.12 points , or nearly half of Friday 's drop . </s>
