<s> In a move to prevent any dislocation in the financial markets from the California earthquake , the Securities and Exchange Commission said it temporarily reassigned options listed on the Pacific Stock Exchange to the American , New York and Philadelphia stock exchanges and to the Chicago Board Options Exchange . </s>
<s> The decision , which affects millions of dollars of trading positions , was made late yesterday because the Pacific exchange 's options floor was shut down as a result of Tuesday 's earthquake . </s>
<s> The SEC , faced with a major squeeze on options positions , said it was necessary to ensure that options listed on the exchange could be traded today and tomorrow . </s>
<s> SEC Chairman Richard Breeden said the cooperation by the exchanges would enable investors to buy and sell options listed solely on the Pacific exchange , guaranteeing the liquidity of the market . </s>
<s> Officials at the four exchanges said well over 50 traders from the Pacific exchange were taking flights from San Francisco late yesterday to the American , New York and Philadelphia exchanges and to the CBOE , where they would continue making markets in the Pacific-listed options . </s>
<s> The Big Board said carpenters quickly erected a new options floor to accomodate 40 traders from the Pacific exchange . </s>
<s> In addition , specialists on the exchanges agreed to provide backup capital for market-making in Pacific exchange options traded on the exchanges . </s>
<s> Trading was light on the Pacific Stock Exchange yesterday , with workers at the exchange 's main floor in San Francisco struggling to execute orders by flashlight as a result of a continuing power outage . </s>
<s> The most pressing problem was the suspension of options trading . </s>
<s> The Pacific exchange has options for 129 underlying stock issues , including highly active Hilton Hotels Corp. , which is listed on the Big Board . </s>
<s> Investors were concerned that they might be unable to exercise options that expire tomorrow . </s>
<s> But professionals said throughout the day that the shutdown would n't be a cause for alarm even if it were to persist for several days . </s>
<s> `` I 've told my staff and clients that they still have the ability to exercise their options , because they are guaranteed by the Options Clearing Corp. , '' said Michael Schwartz , a senior registered options strategist at Oppenheimer & Co . </s>
<s> The SEC reassigned trading in the options , however , to allow investors to do more than simply exercise the options . </s>
<s> While the exchange 's equities floor in San Francisco remained open on a limited basis , orders were being routed and executed in Los Angeles . </s>
<s> Workers could dial out , but they could n't receive telephone calls . </s>
<s> `` It 's a very uncertain situation right now , '' said Navin Vyas , administrative assistant of trading floor operations of the exchange , which has daily volume of about 10 million shares . </s>
<s> Because the exchange 's computer was rerouting orders to the exchange 's trading operations in Los Angeles , `` business is as usual '' Mr. Vyas said . </s>
<s> `` If one city is down , the other can take over . '' </s>
<s> Meanwhile , the brokerage firms in San Francisco were trying to cope . </s>
<s> Charles Daggs , chairman and chief executive officer of Sutro & Co. , said traders came to work at 5 a.m. PDT -- many on foot because of uncertain road and traffic conditions -- but learned that they would have to await a required inspection by the city in order to turn the power back on at the company 's two main facilities there . </s>
<s> That should happen by today , he said . </s>
<s> Traders worked with the help of sunlight streaming through windows , despite large cracks in the walls and a lack of incoming phone calls . </s>
<s> Also , most of the telecommunications equipment was out . </s>
<s> The traders were executing municipal bond , mutual fund and other orders through a sister firm , Tucker Anthony Inc. , which is also owned by John Hancock Freedom Securities but is based in New York . </s>
<s> `` We are having a regular day . </s>
<s> Volume is down out of San Francisco , but not out of the 11 outlying offices , '' Mr. Daggs added . </s>
<s> Sutro 's Oakland office executed orders through the Sacramento office , which was n't affected by the quake . </s>
<s> Others , like Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. , which has eight offices in the San Francisco area , set up an 800 number yesterday morning for customers to obtain market commentary and other help . </s>
<s> At Kidder , Peabody & Co. 's Sacramento branch , Manager Janet White received calls yesterday morning from workers in San Francisco who offered to work in Sacramento . </s>
<s> Then she discovered that Quotron Systems Inc. 's Sacramento lines were down , because they are normally tied in through a system that goes through San Francisco . </s>
<s> So the Kidder brokers had to call other company offices to get quotes on stocks . </s>
<s> At Quotron , the company 's National Call-In Center , which swung into action for the first time last month for Hurricane Hugo , assembled a tactical team at 5 a.m. yesterday to begin rerouting lines and restore service to brokers and traders . </s>
<s> The company dispatched as many as 200 people in the San Francisco area to do the work , though most of the rerouting was done by computer . </s>
<s> Service appeared to be down throughout the financial district in downtown San Francisco , while just parts of Oakland and San Jose were knocked out . </s>
<s> But Dale Irvine , director of the emergency center , said service was being restored to outlying San Francisco areas . </s>
<s> In Chicago yesterday , Options Clearing confirmed that it guarantees the Pacific exchange options . </s>
<s> The firm also will permit its members and the public `` to exercise their put and call options contracts traded on the Pacific exchange '' even if the exchange is closed , said Wayne Luthringshausen , chairman of Options Clearing . </s>
<s> -LRB- Put options give holders the right , but not the obligation , to sell a financial instrument at a specified price , while call options give holders the right , but not the obligation , to buy a financial instrument at a specified price -RRB- . </s>
<s> Investors and traders in Pacific exchange options `` are protected to the extent that they can convert their put and call options into the underlying instrument , '' Mr. Luthringshausen said . </s>
<s> `` We are seeing such exercises today , in fact . </s>
