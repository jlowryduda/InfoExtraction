<s> Two rules in pending congressional legislation threaten to hinder leveraged buy-outs by raising the price tags of such deals by as much as 10 % . </s>
<s> Wall Street is seething over the rules , which would curtail the tax deductibility of debt used in most LBOs . </s>
<s> The provisions , in deficit-reduction bills recently passed by the House and Senate , could further cool the takeover boom that has been the driving force behind the bull market in stocks for much of the 1980s , some tax experts and investment bankers argue . </s>
<s> Indeed , some investment bankers have already started restructuring deals to cope with the expected rules . </s>
<s> Wall Street has all but conceded on the issue and is now lobbying for the less onerous Senate version of one of the provisions . </s>
<s> At issue is the deductibility of certain junk bonds that are used in most LBOs . </s>
<s> Such high-yield debt is similar to a zero-coupon bond in that it is sold at a discount to face value , with interest accruing instead of being paid to the holder . </s>
<s> Under current rules , that accrued interest is deductible by the company issuing the debt . </s>
<s> The House version of the legislation would kill that deduction , and label any such debt as equity , which is n't deductible . </s>
<s> The less-rigorous Senate version would defer the deductibility for roughly five years . </s>
<s> `` You see these in just about every LBO , '' said Robert Willens , senior vice president in charge of tax issues at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York . </s>
<s> `` It becomes a source of cash '' for the company making the LBO because it gets a deduction and does n't have to repay the debt for several years . </s>
<s> Typically , Mr. Willens estimates , this type of debt makes up 15 % to 20 % of the financing for LBOs . </s>
<s> These types of bonds have been used in buy-outs of companies such as RJR Nabisco Inc. , Storer Communications Inc. and Kroger Co . </s>
<s> A second provision passed by the Senate and House would eliminate a rule allowing companies that post losses resulting from LBO debt to receive refunds of taxes paid over the previous three years . </s>
<s> For example , if a company posted a loss of $ 100 million from buy-out interest payments , the existing rule would allow the concern to be able to receive a refund from the tax it paid from 1986 through 1989 , when it may have been a profitable public company . </s>
<s> But that rule is being virtually overlooked by Wall Street , which is concentrating on coping with the deduction issue . </s>
<s> `` Prices for LBOs have to come down if you do n't have that feature , '' argued Lawrence Schloss , managing director for merchant banking at Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. in New York . </s>
<s> Several Wall Street officials say the proposed legislation already is having an impact . </s>
<s> An investment group led by Chicago 's Pritzker family recently lowered a $ 3.35 billion bid for American Medical International , Beverly Hills , Calif. , because of the threat of the legislation . </s>
<s> Moreover , one investment banker , who requested anonymity , said his firm did n't raise the ante for a target company earlier this month after a stronger bid emerged from a public company that was n't concerned about the financing provision . </s>
<s> `` We would have paid more if we thought that law was n't going to pass , '' he said . </s>
<s> One possible solution for Wall Street is to increase the equity part of the transaction -- that is , give lenders a bigger stake in the surviving company rather than just interest payments . </s>
<s> That would force the buy-out firm and the target company 's management to reduce their level of ownership . </s>
<s> `` The pigs in the trough may have to give a little bit of the slop back and then the deal can go through , '' said Peter C. Canellos , tax partner at Wachtell , Lipton , Rosen & Katz . </s>
<s> Another solution , said a tax lawyer who requested anonymity , is for firms to use convertible bonds that sell at a discount . </s>
<s> Since they have a lower interest rate , they would n't fall under the junk-bond category that would lose its deductibility . </s>
<s> The House version of the bill would make debt non-deductible if it pays five percentage points above Treasury notes , has at least a five-year maturity and does n't pay interest for at least one year out of the first five . </s>
<s> The bill would then declare that the debt is equity and therefore is n't deductible . </s>
<s> The Senate bill would only deny the deduction until interest is actually paid . </s>
<s> Currently , even though the issuer does n't pay tax , the debt holder is taxed on the accrued interest . </s>
<s> But those holders are often foreign investors and tax-exempt pension funds that do n't pay taxes on their holdings . </s>
<s> The Senate estimates that its version of the provision would yield $ 17 million the first year and a total of $ 409 million over five years . </s>
<s> The House version would raise slightly more . </s>
<s> Even if Wall Street finds ways around the new rules , a Senate aide contends LBOs will become somewhat more difficult . </s>
<s> `` There 's no question it will make LBOs more expensive , '' he said . </s>
<s> `` The interest deduction was the engine that made these things more productive . </s>
