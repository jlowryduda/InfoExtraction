<s> Senate Republicans have settled on a proposal that would cut the capital-gains tax for individuals and corporations . </s>
<s> At the same time , a small group of Senate Democrats are working on a similar plan and may introduce it soon . </s>
<s> Sen. Bob Packwood -LRB- R. , Ore. -RRB- , the lead sponsor of the GOP proposal , said he intends to unveil the plan today and to offer it as an amendment to whatever legislation comes along , particularly this month 's bill to raise the federal borrowing limit . </s>
<s> He gave 10-to-1 odds that a capital-gains tax cut of some sort would be approved this year , though it probably wo n't be included in the pending deficit-reduction bill . </s>
<s> He added that he expects to talk to the Democrats who also wanted to cut the gains tax about drafting a joint proposal . </s>
<s> For individuals , the Packwood plan would exclude from income 5 % of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more than one year . </s>
<s> The exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year the asset was held until it reached a maximum of 35 % . </s>
<s> The exclusion would apply to assets sold after Oct. 1 , 1989 . </s>
<s> As an alternative , he said , taxpayers could chose to reduce their gains by an inflation index . </s>
<s> For corporations , the top tax rate on the sale of assets held for more than three years would be cut to 33 % from the current top rate of 34 % . </s>
<s> That rate would gradually decline to as little as 29 % for corporate assets held for 15 years . </s>
<s> The Packwood plan would also include a proposal , designed by Sen. William Roth -LRB- R. , Del. -RRB- , that would expand and alter the deduction for individual retirement accounts . </s>
<s> The Roth plan would create a new , non-deductible IRA from which money could be withdrawn tax-free not only for retirement , but also for the purchase of a first home and to pay education and medical expenses . </s>
<s> Current IRAs could be rolled over into the new IRAs but would be subject to tax . </s>
<s> For their part , the group of Democrats are working on a plan that , like the Packwood proposal , would grant larger exclusions to assets the longer they were held by individuals and companies . </s>
<s> Newly acquired assets would get a bigger break than those currently held . </s>
<s> An extra exclusion would be given to long-held stock in small and medium-size corporations just starting up . </s>
<s> No one in the Senate is considering the capital-gains plan passed by the House . </s>
<s> That plan would provide a 30 % exclusion to assets sold over a 2 1\/2-year period ending Dec. 31 , 1991 . </s>
<s> After then , the House measure would boost the tax rate to 28 % and exclude from tax the gain attributable to inflation . </s>
<s> Senators are focusing on making a capital-gains differential permanent . </s>
<s> Separately , Chairman Dan Rostenkowski -LRB- D. , Ill . -RRB- of the House Ways and Means Committee said he did n't want the capital-gains tax cut or any other amendments attached to the pending bill raising the federal borrowing limit . </s>
<s> The current debt limit expires Oct. 31 . </s>
<s> He also urged House and Senate negotiators to rid the deficit-reduction bill of all provisions that increase the budget deficit , including the House-passed capital-gains provision . </s>
