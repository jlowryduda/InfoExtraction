<s> Bond prices rambled yesterday as investors kept close watch on the stock market and worried about a wave of new supply . </s>
<s> Early yesterday , bonds rose as investors rushed to buy Treasury securities on the prospect that stocks would plummet in the aftermath of the massive California earthquake . </s>
<s> For example , some securities analysts warned that stocks of certain insurance companies , which face massive damage claims , would get hit hard . </s>
<s> But when the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose instead , bonds drifted lower . </s>
<s> With stocks not a major focus , `` we 're waiting for the next guiding light , '' said Brian J. Fabbri , chief economist at Midland Montagu Securities Inc . </s>
<s> `` If the stock market tremors are behind us , then the bond market will go back to looking at the next batch of economic numbers to determine '' where interest rates are heading . </s>
<s> The Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond , which jumped 3\/8 point , or about $ 3.75 for each $ 1,000 face amount , during the first hour of trading , ended little changed . </s>
<s> Interest rates barely budged from Tuesday 's levels . </s>
<s> Most junk bonds , which have been battered in recent weeks , continued a slow recuperation and ended unchanged to slightly higher . </s>
<s> But some so-called high-quality junk issues fell as some mutual funds sold their most liquid issues to raise cash . </s>
<s> RJR Holdings Capital Corp. 's 14.7 % bonds due 2009 fell one point . </s>
<s> Other RJR issues fell between 1\/2 point and 1 1\/2 point . </s>
<s> In the latest sign of how difficult it is to place certain junk bonds , Continental Airlines said it was forced to scale back the size of its latest offering . </s>
<s> Continental , a unit of Texas Air Corp. , slashed the size of its note offering from $ 150 million to $ 71 million . </s>
<s> The move had been widely expected . </s>
<s> In the multipart offering , the company sold a portion of secured notes but shelved all the unsecured notes . </s>
<s> A Continental spokeswoman said the notes may be offered at a later date . </s>
<s> `` This was not a do-or-die deal , '' she said . </s>
<s> `` I think this is a market that required some level of security . </s>
<s> It did not make sense to offer unsecured paper in an unsettling market . '' </s>
<s> Investors have been speculating for weeks about the market 's ability to place the $ 7 billion to $ 10 billion of new junk bonds scheduled to be sold by year end . </s>
<s> Supply troubles were also on the minds of Treasury investors yesterday , who worried about the flood of new government securities coming next week . </s>
<s> `` We 're being bombarded by new Treasury and agency debt offerings , '' said William Sullivan Jr. , director of money-market research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc . </s>
<s> `` The market is concerned about its ability to underwrite all this debt at current levels . '' </s>
<s> In addition to the $ 15.6 billion of Treasury bills to be sold at next week 's regular Monday auction , the government will sell $ 10 billion of new two-year Treasury notes . </s>
<s> And Resolution Funding Corp. said late yesterday that it will sell $ 4.5 billion of 30-year bonds Wednesday . </s>
<s> Refcorp is the financing unit of Resolution Trust Corp. , a new government agency created to rescue the nation 's troubled thrifts . </s>
<s> Its securities have been dubbed `` bailout bonds '' by traders . </s>
<s> In when-issued trading , the two-year Treasurys had a yield of about 7.88 % . </s>
<s> In the municipal market , all eyes were on California debt as investors tried to gauge the financial ramifications of Tuesday 's earthquake . </s>
<s> But traders said the quake had only a minor impact on the trading of California state and local municipal debt . </s>
<s> `` There are certain bonds traders refer to as ` earthquake ' bonds because the -LRB- issuers -RRB- are on top of the San Andreas fault , '' said Zane Mann , editor of the California Municipal Bond Advisor , a newsletter for investors . </s>
<s> Since those bonds already pay a slightly higher yield , an extra premium for the earthquake risk , they were n't materially affected . </s>
<s> But some bond market analysts said that could quickly change if property casualty insurance companies scramble to sell portions of their municipal portfolios to raise cash to pay damage claims . </s>
<s> `` Insurance companies will foot a substantial amount of the bill to reconstruct San Francisco , '' said Charles Lieberman , chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp . </s>
<s> He also expects the performance of municipals to lag Treasurys as California is forced to issue new debt over time to repair public facilities . </s>
<s> A report issued late yesterday by Standard & Poor 's Corp. concluded the quake wo n't cause `` wide-scale credit deterioration '' for issuers and debt issues in the 12-county area of Northern California affected by the quake . </s>
<s> Treasury Securities </s>
<s> Treasury bonds ended narrowly mixed in quiet trading . </s>
<s> The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 100 29\/32 to yield 8.03 % , compared with 100 28\/32 to yield 8.04 % Tuesday . </s>
<s> The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at a price of 99 26\/32 to yield 8 % , compared with 99 25\/32 to yield 8.01 % . </s>
<s> Short-term rates were little changed . </s>
<s> Corporate Issues </s>
<s> Investment-grade corporate bonds ended 1\/4 point lower . </s>
<s> The Continental junk bond offering , underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , was the only new issue priced yesterday . </s>
<s> In the four-part offering , the $ 71 million of secured equipment certificates was priced to yield 13.75 % to 15.75 % . </s>
<s> Municipals </s>
<s> Municipal bonds ended about 1\/8 to 3\/8 point lower , hurt by the circulation of two `` bid-wanted '' lists totaling $ 655 million . </s>
<s> Chemical Securities Inc. is acting as agent for the seller . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , some California issues were down a touch more than the broad market , but traders said there had n't been much investor selling because of the quake . </s>
<s> But New York City general obligation bonds came under selling pressure . </s>
<s> Traders said a steady stream of bonds was put up for sale yesterday , pushing yields for longer maturities up 0.05 percentage point . </s>
<s> Traders said investors were reacting to recent negative news on the city 's finances and are nervous ahead of the Nov. 7 election . </s>

<s> Mortgage-Backed Securities </s>
<s> Mortgage securities ended little changed after light dealings . </s>
<s> There was no appreciable market impact from the California earthquake . </s>
<s> Dealers said there was some concern that insurance companies might be forced to sell mortgage securities to help pay earthquake-related claims , but no selling materialized . </s>
<s> The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. and Federal National Mortgage Association , two dominant issuers of mortgage securities , have a sizable amount of California home loans in their mortgagebacked pools . </s>
<s> But their potential quake exposure is seen as small given that they require a financial cushion on all the loans they purchase . </s>
<s> And because Northern California home prices are so high , loans from the region often are too large to be included in Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae pools . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , Government National Mortgage Association 9 % securities for November delivery ended at 97 29\/32 , unchanged . </s>
<s> Freddie Mac 9 % securities were at 97 4\/32 , down 1\/32 . </s>
<s> In derivative markets , Fannie Mae issued two $ 400 million real estate mortgage investment conduits backed by its 9 % securities . </s>
<s> Foreign Bonds </s>
<s> British government bonds , or gilts , ended moderately lower as equities there recovered from Tuesday 's drop . </s>
<s> The Treasury 's 11 3\/4 % bond due 2003\/2007 fell 11\/32 to 111 31\/32 to yield 10.08 % , while the 12 % notes due 1995 were down 7\/32 to 103 22\/32 to yield 11.04 % . </s>
<s> Traders said today may be an anxious day for the market . </s>
<s> Several key economic figures are due out and Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson is scheduled to give the annual `` Mansion House '' address to the financial community . </s>
<s> The chancellor sometimes has used the occasion to announce major economic policy changes . </s>
<s> Economists do n't expect any such changes in this year 's address , given Mr. Lawson 's apparent reluctance to adjust policy currently . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , Japanese government bonds retreated in quiet trading , stymied by the dollar 's resiliency . </s>
<s> Japan 's bellwether 4.6 % bond due 1998 ended on brokers ' screens at 95.75 to yield 5.315 % . </s>
<s> In West Germany , investors stayed on the sidelines as the bond market searched for direction . </s>
