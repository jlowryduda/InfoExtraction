<s> Digital Equipment Corp. is planning a big coming-out party on Tuesday for its first line of mainframe computers . </s>
<s> But an uninvited guest is expected to try to crash the party . </s>
<s> On the morning of the long-planned announcement , International Business Machines Corp. is to introduce its own new mainframe . </s>
<s> `` Their attitude is , ` You want to talk mainframes , we 'll talk mainframes , ' '' says one computer industry executive . </s>
<s> `` They 're deliberately trying to steal our thunder , '' a Digital executive complains . </s>
<s> `` Maybe we should take it as a compliment . '' </s>
<s> Digital 's target is the $ 40 billion market for mainframe computers , the closet-sized number-crunchers that nearly every big company needs to run its business . </s>
<s> IBM , based in Armonk , N.Y. , has dominated the market for decades . </s>
<s> That does n't scare Digital , which has grown to be the world 's second-largest computer maker by poaching customers of IBM 's mid-range machines . </s>
<s> Digital , based in Maynard , Mass. , hopes to stage a repeat performance in mainframes , and it has spent almost $ 1 billion developing the new technology . </s>
<s> A spoiler , nimble Tandem Computers Inc. in Cupertino , Calif. , jumped into the fray earlier this week with an aggressively priced entry . </s>
<s> IBM appears more worried about Digital , which has a broad base of customers waiting for the new line , dubbed the VAX 9000 . </s>
<s> `` It 's going to be nuclear war , '' says Thomas Willmott , a consultant with Aberdeen Group Inc . </s>
<s> The surge in competition is expected to stir new life into the huge mainframe market , where growth has slowed to single digits in recent years . </s>
<s> IBM 's traditional mainframe rivals , including Unisys Corp. , Control Data Corp. and NCR Corp. , have struggled recently . </s>
<s> Digital is promising a new approach . </s>
<s> Robert M. Glorioso , Digital 's vice president for high performance systems , says Digital 's mainframe is designed not as a central computer around which everything revolves , but as part of a decentralized network weaving together hundreds of workstations , personal computers , printers and other devices . </s>
<s> And unlike IBM 's water-cooled mainframes , it does n't need any plumbing . </s>
<s> The challengers will have a big price advantage . </s>
<s> Digital is expected to tag its new line from about $ 1.24 million to $ 4.4 million and up , depending on configuration . </s>
<s> That 's about half the price of comparably equipped IBM mainframes . </s>
<s> Tandem 's pricing is just as aggressive . </s>
<s> The heightened competition will hit IBM at a difficult time . </s>
<s> The computer giant 's current mainframe line , which has sold well and has huge profit margins , is starting to show its age . </s>
<s> The new 3090s due next week will boost performance by only about 8 % to 10 % . </s>
<s> And IBM is n't expected to deliver a new generation of mainframes until 1991 . </s>
<s> Still , no one expects IBM 's rivals to deliver a knockout . </s>
<s> IBM has a near-monopoly on mainframes , with an estimated 70 % share of the market . </s>
<s> IBM is five times the size of Digital -- and 40 times the size of Tandem -- and wields enormous market power . </s>
<s> It counts among its customers a majority of the world 's largest corporations , which entrust their most critical business information to IBM computers . </s>
<s> `` We 're not going to walk in and replace a company 's corporate accounting system if it 's already running on an IBM mainframe , '' concedes Kenneth H. Olsen , Digital 's president . </s>
<s> He says Digital will target faster-growing market segments such as on-line transaction processing , which includes retail-sales tracking , airline reservations and bank-teller networks . </s>
<s> Tandem , which already specializes in on-line transaction processing , is a potent competitor in that market . </s>
<s> A key marketing target for Digital will be the large number of big customers who already own both Digital and IBM systems . </s>
<s> One such company is Bankers Trust Co . </s>
<s> Stanley Rose , a vice president , technological and strategic planning at Bankers Trust , says that despite Digital 's low prices , `` we are n't about to unplug our IBM mainframes for a DEC machine . </s>
<s> The software conversion costs would dwarf any savings . '' </s>
<s> But Mr. Rose is still looking seriously at the 9000 . </s>
<s> Bankers Trust uses Digital 's VAX to run its huge money-transfer and capital markets accounts , juggling hundreds of billions of dollars each day , he says . </s>
<s> As that system grows , larger computers may be needed . </s>
<s> `` In the past , customers had to go to IBM when they outgrew the VAX . </s>
<s> Now they do n't have to , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` That 's going to cost IBM revenue . '' </s>
<s> Analysts say Digital can expect this pent-up demand for the new VAX to fuel strong sales next year . </s>
<s> Barry F. Willman , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. , estimates the 9000 could boost sales by more than $ 1 billion in the fiscal year beginning in July . </s>
<s> He bases the estimate on a survey of hundreds of Digital 's largest customers . </s>
<s> Although Digital will announce a full family of mainframes next week , it is n't expected to begin shipping in volume until next year . </s>
<s> The first model available will be the 210 , which is likely to appeal to many technical and scientific buyers interested in the optional super-charger , or vector processor , says Terry Shannon of International Data Corp. , a market research concern . </s>
<s> Four more models , aimed squarely at IBM 's commercial customers , are expected to begin shipping in late June . </s>
<s> Most analysts do n't expect the new mainframes to begin contributing significantly to revenue before the fiscal first quarter , which begins next July 1 . </s>
<s> Digital 's new line has been a long time coming . </s>
<s> The company has long struggled to deliver a strong mainframe-class product , and made a costly decision in 1988 to halt development of an interim product meant to stem the revenue losses at the high end . </s>
<s> Digital 's failure to deliver a true mainframe-class machine before now may have cost the company as much as $ 1 billion in revenue in fiscal 1989 , Mr. Willman says . </s>
<s> IBM will face still more competition in coming months . </s>
<s> Amdahl Corp. , backed by Japan 's Fujitsu Ltd. , has a growing share of the market with its low-priced , IBM-compatible machines . </s>
<s> And National Advanced Systems , a joint venture of Japan 's Hitachi Ltd. and General Motors Corp. 's Electronic Data Systems , is expected to unveil a line of powerful IBM-compatible mainframes later this year . </s>
