<s> Japan Air Lines , Lufthansa German Airlines and Air France reportedly plan to form an international air-freight company this year , a move that could further consolidate the industry . </s>
<s> Japanese newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that the three giants plan to integrate their cargo computers and ground-cargo and air-cargo systems . </s>
<s> They reportedly will invest a total of 20 billion yen -LRB- $ 140 million -RRB- in the venture , whose headquarters would be in France or West Germany . </s>
<s> The action follows Federal Express Corp. 's acquisition of Flying Tiger Line Inc. in August . </s>
<s> After that , `` it would make sense for airlines to talk about doing things jointly , '' said Cotton Daly , director of cargo services for New York consulting firm Simat , Helliesen & Eichner Inc . </s>
<s> Mr. Daly said such discussions are motivated by the competitive threat posed by Federal Express , United Parcel Service of America Inc. and other fast-growing air-freight companies . </s>
<s> Many airlines are talking about cargo ventures , and there have been rumors about such a tie between JAL and European airlines . </s>
<s> In Tokyo , a JAL spokesman said he could n't confirm or deny the latest Japanese report . </s>
<s> But he said JAL is talking to Lufthansa and Air France about some sort of cargo venture . </s>
<s> `` It is just one of a number of strategies JAL has embarked upon to come to terms with the situation in Europe after 1992 , '' the deadline for ending trade barriers in the EC , he said . </s>
<s> In Frankfurt , a Lufthansa spokesman confirmed talks are under way , but declined to comment . </s>
<s> A Lufthansa spokeswoman in Tokyo said the head of Lufthansa 's cargo operations had been in Toyko last week for talks with JAL . </s>
<s> In Paris , Air France declined to comment . </s>
<s> `` Nothing is defined or signed at this point , '' Mr. Daly said of the talks . </s>
<s> Whatever accord the three carriers reach , he said , he is skeptical it would create a separate airline . </s>
<s> If the three companies pool their air-freight businesses , their clout would be considerable . </s>
<s> According to figures from the International Air Transport Association , they carried a combined 1.8 million tons of freight last year . </s>
<s> Federal Express and Flying Tiger , as separate companies , carried a combined 2.6 million tons . </s>
<s> Air France and Lufthansa last month concluded a far-reaching cooperation accord that includes air-freight activities . </s>
<s> They plan to increase cooperation in freight ground-handling and create a world-wide computer system to process cargo . </s>
<s> Other airlines would have access to the system , they said , and negotiations with partners were already under way . </s>
<s> Both European airlines operate extensive fleets of Boeing 747 freighters and 747 Combis , aircraft that carry both freight and passengers on the main deck . </s>
<s> They currently have large orders for cargo planes . </s>
<s> Several airlines , including Lufthansa , JAL and Cathay Pacific Airways , are working on a so-called global cargo system and are trying to attract other carriers to join , Mr. Daly said . </s>
<s> JAL also has signaled it is looking for toeholds in Europe before the end of 1992 . </s>
<s> Last month , the carrier said it wanted to lease crews and planes from British Airways so it could funnel its passengers from London to other European destinations . </s>
<s> British Airways said it has n't received a proposal from JAL . </s>
<s> But last week there were air-traffic negotiations between the U.K. and Japan , a likely first step to any commercial agreement between JAL and British Airways or another U.K. carrier . </s>
