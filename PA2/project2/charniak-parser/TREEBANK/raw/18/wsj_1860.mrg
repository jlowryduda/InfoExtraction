<s> Jaguar PLC 's chairman said he hopes to reach a friendly pact with General Motors Corp. within a month that may involve the British luxury-car maker 's producing a cheaper executive model . </s>
<s> Sir John Egan told reporters at London 's Motorfair yesterday he `` would be disappointed if we could n't do -LCB- the deal -RCB- within a month . '' </s>
<s> He said the tie-up would mean Jaguar could `` develop cars down range -LCB- in price -RCB- from where we are '' by offering access to GM 's high-volume parts production . </s>
<s> Besides creating joint manufacturing ventures , the accord is expected to give GM about a 15 % stake that eventually would rise to about 30 % . </s>
<s> Jaguar figures a friendly alliance with GM will fend off unwelcome advances from Ford Motor Co . </s>
<s> But Ford , Jaguar 's biggest shareholder since lifting its stake to 10.4 % this week , is pressing harder for talks with Sir John . </s>
<s> `` We 're getting to the point where we are going to have to meet '' with him , one Ford official said yesterday . </s>
<s> Ford probably will renew its request for such a meeting soon , he added . </s>
<s> Sir John has spurned Ford 's advances since the U.S. auto giant launched a surprise bid for as much as 15 % of Jaguar last month . </s>
<s> Ford has signaled it might acquire a majority interest later . </s>
<s> `` I 'm not obligated to sit down and talk to anybody , '' the Jaguar chairman asserted yesterday . </s>
<s> He did n't rule out negotiations with Ford , however . </s>
<s> The fiercely proud but financially strapped British company prefers to remain independent and publicly held , despite Ford 's promise of access to cash and technological know-how . </s>
<s> Sir John noted that GM , a longtime Jaguar supplier , agrees `` we should remain an independent company . '' </s>
<s> He said Jaguar started negotiating with GM and several other car makers over a year ago , but the rest `` dropped by the wayside ever since the share price went above # 4 -LRB- $ 6.30 -RRB- a share . '' </s>
<s> Jaguar shares stood at 405 pence before Ford 's initial announcement , but the subsequent takeover frenzy has driven them up . </s>
<s> The stock traded late yesterday on London 's stock exchange at 673 pence , up 19 pence . </s>
<s> Developing an executive-model range would mark a major departure for Britain 's leading luxury-car maker . </s>
<s> A typical British executive car is mass produced and smaller than a luxury car . </s>
<s> It generally fetches no more than # 25,000 -LRB- $ 39,400 -RRB- -- roughly # 16,000 less than the highest-priced Jaguars , which are all known for their hand-crafted leather work . </s>
<s> `` We have designs for such -LCB- executive -RCB- cars , but have never been able to develop them , '' Sir John said . </s>
<s> GM 's help would `` make it possible -LCB- for Jaguar -RCB- to build a wider range of cars . '' </s>
<s> An executive model would significantly boost Jaguar 's yearly output of 50,000 cars . </s>
<s> `` You are talking about a couple hundred thousand a year , '' said Bob Barber , an auto-industry analyst at U.K. brokerage James Capel & Co . </s>
<s> A pact with GM may emerge in as little as two weeks , according to sources close to the talks . </s>
<s> The deal would require approval by a majority of Jaguar shareholders . </s>
<s> `` We have to make it attractive enough that -LCB- holders -RCB- would accept it , '' Sir John said . </s>
<s> That may be difficult , the Jaguar chairman acknowledged , `` when you have somebody else breathing down your neck . </s>
<s> '' Ford probably would try to kill the proposal by enlisting support from U.S. takeover-stock speculators and holding out the carrot of a larger bid later , said Stephen Reitman , European auto analyst at London brokers UBS Phillips & Drew . </s>
<s> Ford ca n't make a full-fledged bid for Jaguar until U.K. government restrictions expire . </s>
<s> The anti-takeover measure prevents any outside investor from buying more than 15 % of Jaguar shares without permission until Dec. 31 , 1990 . </s>
<s> But with its 10.4 % stake , Ford can convene a special Jaguar shareholders ' meeting and urge them to drop the restrictions prematurely . </s>
<s> `` It 's a very valuable weapon in their armory , '' which could enable Ford to bid sooner for Jaguar , observed Mr. Barber of James Capel . </s>
<s> Otherwise , Jaguar may have to tolerate the two U.S. auto giants each owning a 15 % stake for more than a year . </s>
<s> `` It would be difficult to see how a car company can be owned by a collective , '' Sir John said . </s>
<s> `` It has never been done before , but there 's always a first . </s>
