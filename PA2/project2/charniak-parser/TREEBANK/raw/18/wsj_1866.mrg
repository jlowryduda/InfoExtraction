<s> Two years of coddling , down the drain . </s>
<s> That 's the way a lot of brokers feel today on the second anniversary of the 1987 stock-market crash . </s>
<s> Ever since that fearful Black Monday , they 've been tirelessly wooing wary individual investors -- trying to convince them that Oct. 19 , 1987 , was a fluke and that the stock market really is a safe place for average Americans to put their hard-earned dollars . </s>
<s> And until last Friday , it seemed those efforts were starting to pay off . </s>
<s> `` Some of those folks were coming back , '' says Leslie Quick Jr. , chairman , of discount brokers Quick & Reilly Group Inc . </s>
<s> `` We had heard from people who had n't been active '' for a long time . </s>
<s> Then came the frightening 190-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and a new wave of stock-market volatility . </s>
<s> All of a sudden , it was back to square one . </s>
<s> `` It 's going to set things back for a period , because it reinforces the concern of volatility , '' says Jeffrey B. Lane , president of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc . </s>
<s> `` I think it will shake confidence one more time , and a lot of this business is based on client confidence . '' </s>
<s> Brokers around the country say the reaction from individual investors this week has been almost eerie . </s>
<s> Customers and potential customers are suddenly complaining about the stock market in the exact way they did in post-crash 1987 . </s>
<s> `` The kinds of questions you had before have resurfaced , '' says Raymond A. `` Chip '' Mason , chairman of regional brokerage firm Legg Mason Inc. , Baltimore . </s>
<s> `` I can just tell the questions are right back where they were : ` What 's going on ? , ' ` Ca n't anything be done about program trading ? , ' ` Does n't the exchange understand ? , ' ` Where is the SEC on this ? ' '' </s>
<s> Mr. Mason says he 's convinced the public still wants to invest in common stocks , even though they believe the deck is stacked against them . </s>
<s> But `` these wide swings scare them to death . '' </s>
<s> All of this is bad news for the big brokerage firms such as Shearson and Merrill Lynch & Co. that have big `` retail , '' or individual-investor , businesses . </s>
<s> After expanding rapidly during the bull-market years up to the 1987 crash , retail brokerage operations these days are getting barely enough business to pay the overhead . </s>
<s> True , the amount of money investors are willing to entrust to their brokers has been growing lately . </s>
<s> But those dollars have been going into such `` safe '' products as money market funds , which do n't generate much in the way of commissions for the brokerage firms . </s>
<s> At discount brokerage Charles Schwab & Co. , such `` cash-equivalent '' investments recently accounted for a record $ 8 billion of the firm 's $ 25 billion of client 's assets . </s>
<s> The brokers ' hope has been that they could soon coax investors into shifting some of their hoard into the stock market . </s>
<s> And before last Friday , they were actually making modest progress . </s>
<s> A slightly higher percentage of New York Stock Exchange volume has been attributed to retail investors in recent months compared with post-crash 1988 , according to Securities Industry Association data . </s>
<s> In 1987 , an average 19.7 % of Big Board volume was retail business , with the monthly level never more than 21.4 % . </s>
<s> The retail participation dropped to an average 18.2 % in 1988 , and shriveled to barely 14 % some months during the year . </s>
<s> Yet in 1989 , retail participation has been more than 20 % in every month , and was 23.5 % in August , the latest month for which figures are available . </s>
<s> Jeffrey Schaefer , the SIA 's research director , says that all of his group 's retail-volume statistics could be overstated by as much as five percentage points because corporate buy-backs are sometimes inadvertently included in Big Board data . </s>
<s> But there did seem to be a retail activity pickup . </s>
<s> But `` Friday did n't help things , '' says Mr. Schaefer . </s>
<s> With the gyrations of recent days , says Hugo Quackenbush , senior vice president at Charles Schwab , many small investors are absolutely convinced that `` they should n't play in the stock market . '' </s>
<s> Joseph Grano , president of retail sales and marketing at PaineWebber Group Inc. , still thinks that individual investors will eventually go back into the stock market . </s>
<s> Investors will develop `` thicker skins , '' and their confidence will return , he says . </s>
<s> Friday 's plunge , he is telling PaineWebber brokers , was nothing more than a `` tremendous reaction to leveraged buy-out stocks . '' </s>
<s> Meanwhile , PaineWebber remains among the leaders in efforts to simply persuade investors to keep giving Wall Street their money . </s>
<s> `` It 's more of an important issue to keep control of those assets , rather than push the investor to move into -LRB- specific -RRB- products such as equities , '' Mr. Grano says . </s>
<s> `` The equity decision will come when the client is ready and when there 's a semblance of confidence . '' </s>
<s> It could be a long wait , say some industry observers . </s>
<s> `` Some investors will tiptoe back in , '' says Richard Ross , a market research director for Elrick & Lavidge in Chicago . </s>
<s> `` Then there 'll be another swing . </s>
<s> Given enough of these , this will drive everyone out except the most hardy , '' he adds . </s>
<s> Mr. Ross , who has been studying retail investors ' perception of risks in the brokerage industry , said a market plunge like Friday 's `` shatters investors ' confidence in their ability to make any judgments on the market . '' </s>
<s> The long-term outlook for the retail brokerage business is `` miserable , '' Mr. Ross declares . </s>
