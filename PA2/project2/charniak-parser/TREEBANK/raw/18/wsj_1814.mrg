<s> Without federal subsidies to developers of beach houses , the economic and structural damage by Hurricane Hugo in South Carolina would have been much less , as highlighted by your Oct. 3 editorial `` Subsidizing Disaster . '' </s>
<s> Congress should stop throwing tax dollars out to sea by subsidizing the development of beach communities on ecologically fragile coastal barrier islands , such as the hard-hit Isle of Palms near Charleston . </s>
<s> As you mentioned , subsidies for development on a number of barrier islands were curtailed in 1982 by the Coastal Barrier Resource System . </s>
<s> The National Taxpayers Union would like Congress to add 800,000 acres to the 453,000 of shoreline in the system by enacting `` The Coastal Barrier Improvement Act of 1989 . '' </s>
<s> This bill simply says that if you want to develop property on a barrier island you have to do so without taxpayer support . </s>
<s> Private-property rights would be upheld because the legislation would not ban coastal development . </s>
<s> However , home builders would have to bear the full costs of such beach-house construction . </s>
<s> A Taxpayers Union study concluded the bill would save taxpayers up to $ 9.3 billion in barrier-island subsidies over 20 years . </s>
<s> Already , the 1982 legislation has saved an estimated $ 800 million . </s>
