<s> With airline deals in a tailspin , legendary Wall Street trader Michael Steinhardt could have trouble parachuting out of USAir Group , traders say . </s>
<s> Only a week ago , when airline buy-out fever was already winding down , Mr. Steinhardt was engaged in a duel with USAir . </s>
<s> He was threatening to take over the carrier , after spending an estimated $ 167 million to build an 8.4 % USAir stake for his investment clients . </s>
<s> The would-be raider even hired an investment banker to give teeth to his takeover threat , which was widely interpreted as an effort to flush out an acquirer for USAir , or for his own stake . </s>
<s> In fighting USAir , Mr. Steinhardt was pitted against another investor , billionnaire Warren Buffett , who bought into USAir to help fend off Mr. Steinhardt . </s>
<s> Mr. Buffett 's firm , Berkshire Hathaway , holds a much bigger stake in the carrier than Mr. Steinhardt 's firm , Steinhardt Partners . </s>
<s> Now , in the wake of UAL 's troubles in financing its buy-out , the airline raiding game has been grounded . </s>
<s> Instead of hoping to sell his USAir stake at analysts ' estimated buy-out price of $ 80 a share , Mr. Steinhardt is stuck with roughly 3.7 million USAir shares that cost him $ 45 , on average , but yesterday closed at 40 1\/2 , up 1\/4 , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading . </s>
<s> `` It does n't make sense to parachute out at this price , '' Mr. Steinhardt says , though he has stopped his takeover talk and now commends USAir managers ' `` operating skills . '' </s>
<s> At the current price , the USAir holding represents 9 % of all the assets that Mr. Steinhardt manages . </s>
<s> A week ago , USAir stock briefly soared above 52 after a report in USA Today that Mr. Steinhardt might launch a hostile bid for the carrier , though takeover speculators say they were skeptical . </s>
<s> `` If USAir is worth 80 as a takeover and the stock went to 52 , the market was saying Steinhardt 's presence was n't worth anything , in terms of getting a deal done , '' says a veteran takeover speculator . </s>
<s> Traders say this all goes to show that even the smartest money manager can get infected with crowd passions . </s>
<s> In trying to raid USAir , Mr. Steinhardt abandoned his usual role as a passive investor , and ran into snags . </s>
<s> Moreover , unlike Mr. Buffett , who often holds big stakes in companies for years , Mr. Steinhardt has n't in the past done much long-term investing . </s>
<s> Mr. Steinhardt , who runs about $ 1.7 billion for Steinhardt Partners , made his name as a gunslinging trader , moving in and out of stocks with agility -- enriching himself and his investment clients . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , his big losses , for instance in 1987 's crash , generally have been trading losses . </s>
<s> So , some see a special irony in the fact that Mr. Steinhardt , the trader , now is encumbered with a massive , illiquid airline holding . </s>
<s> Analysts say USAir stock might lose four or five points if the Steinhardt stake was dumped all at once . </s>
<s> As a result , Mr. Steinhardt must reconcile himself to selling USAir at a loss , or to holding the shares as an old-fashioned investment . </s>
<s> `` Long-term investing -- that 's not Steinhardt 's style , '' chuckles an investor who once worked at Steinhardt Partners . </s>
<s> `` He does n't usually risk that much unless he thinks he has an ace in the hole , '' adds another Steinhardt Partners alumnus . </s>
<s> In recent days , traders say USAir has been buying its own shares , as part of a program to retire about eight million USAir shares , though the carrier wo n't discuss its buy-back program . </s>
<s> If USAir stepped up its share purchases , that might be a way for Mr. Steinhardt to get out , says Timothy Pettee , a Merrill Lynch analyst . </s>
<s> But USAir might not want to help Mr. Steinhardt , he adds . </s>
<s> In 1987 , USAir Chairman Edwin Colodny stonewalled when Trans World Airlines Chairman Carl Icahn threatened to take over the carrier . </s>
<s> Mr. Icahn , a much more practiced raider than Mr. Steinhardt , eventually sold a big USAir stake at a tiny profit through Bear , Stearns . </s>
<s> Mr. Steinhardt also could take that route . </s>
<s> He confers big trading commissions on Wall Street firms . </s>
<s> However , with airline stocks cratering , he might not get a very good price for his shares , traders say . </s>
<s> Especially galling for Mr. Steinhardt , say people close to him , is that USAir 's Mr. Colodny wo n't even take his telephone calls . </s>
<s> While USAir is n't considered absolutely takeover-proof , its defenses , including the sale in August of a 12 % stake in the company to Mr. Buffett 's Berkshire Hathaway , are pretty strong . </s>
<s> USAir 's deal with Mr. Buffett `` was n't exactly a shining example of shareholder democracy , '' Mr. Steinhardt says . </s>
<s> Since last April , the investor has made seven so-called 13D filings in USAir , as he bought and sold the company 's stock . </s>
<s> Such disclosures of big holdings often are used by raiders to try to scare a company 's managers , and to stir interest in the stock . </s>
<s> But of course it would be highly unusual for an investment fund such as Steinhardt Partners to take over a company . </s>
<s> USAir and Mr. Buffett wo n't talk about Mr. Steinhardt at all . </s>
<s> Analysts say USAir has great promise . </s>
<s> By the second half of 1990 , USAir stock could hit 60 , says Helane Becker of Shearson Lehman Hutton . </s>
<s> She thinks traders should buy the stock if it tumbles to 35 . </s>
<s> But meanwhile , USAir is expected to show losses or lackluster profit for several quarters as it tries to digest Piedmont Airlines , which it acquired . </s>
<s> Moreover , some investors think a recession or renewed airfare wars will pummel airline stocks in coming months . </s>
<s> However , Mr. Steinhardt says he 's `` comfortable holding USAir as an investment . '' </s>
<s> While he has bought and sold some USAir shares in recent days , he says that contrary to rumors , he has n't tried to unload his holding . </s>
<s> Mr. Steinhardt adds that he bought USAir stock earlier this year as `` part of a fundamental investment in the airline group . '' </s>
<s> In 1989 , Mr. Steinhardt says he made money trading in Texas Air , AMR and UAL . </s>
<s> Overall , his investments so far this year are showing gains of about 20 % , he adds . </s>
<s> Does Mr. Steinhardt regret his incursion into the takeover-threat game ? </s>
<s> People close to the investor say that was an experiment he is unlikely to repeat . </s>
<s> `` I do n't think you 'll find I 'm making a radical change in my traditional investment style , '' Mr. Steinhardt says . </s>
