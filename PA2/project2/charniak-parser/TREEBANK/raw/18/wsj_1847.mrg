<s> Many in Washington say President Bush will have to raise taxes to pay for his war on drugs . </s>
<s> We have a better idea : Dismantle HUD to pay for the war on drugs . </s>
<s> Housing and Urban Development 's budget is $ 17 billion . </s>
<s> From what we and the nation have been reading , the money is n't being spent very well . </s>
<s> The single most important contribution the government could make now to help the poor is to get the specter of drugs out of their neighborhoods . </s>
<s> If that takes money , take it away from this discredited federal department . </s>
<s> But of course the Democrats pillorying HUD in hearings and in the press have no such solution in mind . </s>
<s> Instead , they 're scrambling to protect the very programs at the heart of the HUD scandal . </s>
<s> This month , HUD Secretary Jack Kemp unveiled a series of proposed reforms to improve management at HUD . </s>
<s> No doubt many of his ideas are worthy , but ultimately he is proposing to make fundamentally flawed programs work slightly more fairly and efficiently . </s>
<s> Congress is unlikely to go even that far . </s>
<s> Last week , Secretary Kemp ran into a buzzsaw of criticism from House Banking Committee members . </s>
<s> They were appalled , for instance , that he wanted to target more of the $ 3 billion Community Development Block Grant -LRB- CDBG -RRB- program to low-income projects and zero out the notorious `` discretionary '' funds that have allowed HUD officials to steer contracts to political cronies . </s>
<s> These development grants mainly enrich developers who want to put up shopping centers and parking garages . </s>
<s> They also give those in Congress political credit for bringing home the pork , and so they are popular with such Members as Mary Rose Oakar . </s>
<s> Rep. Oakar , a Democrat from Cleveland , wants a $ 6.9 million grant so Cleveland can build an 18-story Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . </s>
<s> She says it 'd create 600 jobs and bring Cleveland tourist revenue . </s>
<s> HUD says the project does n't qualify , and Mr. Kemp says that rock 'n' roll musicians and the music industry ought to put up the money . </s>
<s> At the hearing , Rep. Oakar started wailing about `` phoney baloney regulations '' that would stand between her and `` housing for downtown Cleveland . '' </s>
<s> Rep. Chalmers Wylie , an Ohio Republican , rallied to the cause : `` I think the gentlelady is making an important statement . </s>
<s> The implication that if a congressman calls about a project in his district there 's something wrong , I think is most unfortunate . '' </s>
<s> We 're sure some theologian can explain the difference between what the Republican consultants have been doing with HUD and what these gentleladies and gentlemen want to do with HUD . </s>
<s> Our view is that given Congress 's attitude toward HUD , the place probably is beyond reform . </s>
<s> For more than 50 years the federal government has tried various ways to provide housing for the poor and revive cities . </s>
<s> In the process HUD has wasted untold billions , created slums and invited corruption . </s>
<s> Much of HUD 's spending actually is disguised welfare for developers or the middle class . </s>
<s> That includes the CDBG funds and the Federal Housing Administration , which loans out money for private home mortgages and has just been discovered to be $ 4 billion in the hole . </s>
<s> Selling the FHA 's loan portfolio to the highest bidder would save the taxpayers untold billions in future losses . </s>
<s> Some HUD money actually does trickle down to the poor , and zeroing out housing middlemen would free up more money for public housing tenants to manage and even own their units . </s>
<s> The rest ought to be used to clean out drugs from the neighbhorhoods . </s>
<s> Rival gangs have turned cities into combat zones . </s>
<s> Even suburban Prince George 's County , Md. , reported last week there have been a record 96 killings there this year , most of them drug-related . </s>
<s> Innocent bystanders often are the victims . </s>
<s> A man in a wheelchair was gunned down in the crossfire of a Miami drug battle . </s>
<s> A three-year-old Brooklyn boy was used as a shield by a drug dealer . </s>
<s> Decent life in the inner cities wo n't be restored unless the government reclaims the streets from the drug gangs . </s>
<s> Until then , the billions HUD spends on inner-city housing simply is wasted . </s>
<s> It 's still unclear whether Secretary Kemp wants to completely overhaul the engine room at HUD or just tighten a few screws here and there . </s>
<s> No doubt he believes the place can be salvaged . </s>
<s> Having seen the hypocrisy with which Congress has addressed the HUD scandals , we disagree . </s>
<s> It 's time to scrap the politically infested spending machine HUD has become and channel the resources into the drug war . </s>
