<s> Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said it will increase its loan-loss provisions to cover all its loans to lesser developed countries , except Mexico , resulting in an after-tax charge to 1989 earnings of 300 million Canadian dollars -LRB- US$ 255 million -RRB- . </s>
<s> Don Bowder , senior vice president and chief accountant , said the bank 's strong earnings enable it to be the first major Canadian bank to set aside provisions covering all its C$ 1.17 billion in non-Mexican LDC debt . </s>
<s> `` It eliminates the continuing uncertainty with respect to the ultimate value of the loans , '' he said . </s>
<s> The bank said about C$ 525 million will be added to its existing LDC and general loss provisions in its fourth quarter , ending Oct. 31 . </s>
<s> Mr. Bowder said the C$ 300 million charge to earnings would amount to about C$ 1.34 a share . </s>
<s> The bank 's net income for the nine months ended July 31 was C$ 577 million , or C$ 3.10 a share . </s>
<s> Mr. Bowder said the bank will restructure its C$ 604 million of Mexican debt , of which C$ 255 million is in Mexican notes secured by U.S. government bonds . </s>
<s> The bank has a 45 % reserve against the remaining C$ 349 million of Mexican debt and expects to swap that for other Mexican notes supported by U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds . </s>
<s> Mr. Bowder said the bank 's experience with LDC debt has been `` painful '' and this latest move represents the final phase of a program begun seven years ago to reduce its exposure through provisioning , debt sales and debt swaps . </s>
<s> He said the bank will no longer participate in LDC sovereign lending , but will support trade financing and other transactions that meet the bank 's standards . </s>
