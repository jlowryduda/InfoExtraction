<s> Greece 's second bout of general elections this year is slated for Nov. 5 . </s>
<s> For those hoping to see a modicum of political normalcy restored -- in view of Greece 's eight-year misadventure under autocratic pseudosocialism and subsequent three-month hitch with a conservative-communist coalition government -- there is but one bright sign : The scandals still encircling former Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and his fallen socialist government are like flies buzzing around a rotting carcass . </s>
<s> In the mid-June round of voting , Greeks gave no clear mandate to any single political party . </s>
<s> The ad interim coalition government that emerged from post-electoral hagglings was , in essence , little more than the ill-conceived offspring of ideological miscegenation : On one side , the center-right New Democracy Party , headed by Constantine Mitsotakis . </s>
<s> On the other , the so-called Coalition of the Left and Progress -- a quaint and rather deceptive title for a merger of the pro-Soviet Communist Party of Greece and its Euro-Communist cousin , the Hellenic Left . </s>
<s> The unifying bond for this left-right mismatch was plain : PASOK -LRB- Mr. Papandreou 's party -RRB- as common political enemy . </s>
<s> The ostensible goal was a mop-up of government corruption , purportedly at all levels , but the main marks were Mr. Papandreou and his closest associates . </s>
<s> In point of fact , this catharsis was overdue by decades . </s>
<s> When reduced to buzzword status in ex parte pledges , however , the notion transmogrified into a promised assault , with targets primarily for political gains , not justice . </s>
<s> With regard to Greece 's long-bubbling bank-looting scandal , Mr. Papandreou 's principal accuser remains George Koskotas , former owner of the Bank of Crete and self-confessed embezzler , now residing in a jail cell in Salem , Mass. , from where he is fighting extradition proceedings that would return him to Greece . </s>
<s> Mr. Koskotas 's credibility is , at best , problematic . </s>
<s> He has ample motive to shift the blame , and his testimony has also been found less than forthright on numerous points . </s>
<s> Nevertheless , the New Democracy and Communist parties herald his assertions as proof of PASOK complicity . </s>
<s> Among unanswered questions are whether Mr. Papandreou received $ 23 million of stolen Bank of Crete funds and an additional $ 734,000 in bribes , as contended ; whether the prime minister ordered state agencies to deposit some $ 57 million in Mr. Koskotas 's bank and then skim off the interest ; and , what PASOK 's cut was from the $ 210 million Mr. Koskotas pinched . </s>
<s> Two former ministers were so heavily implicated in the Koskotas affair that PASOK members of Parliament voted to refer them to the special court . </s>
<s> But eluding parliamentary probe was the case of millions of drachmas Mr. Koskotas funneled into New Democracy coffers . </s>
<s> In the end , the investigation produced only circumstantial evidence and `` indications '' that point to PASOK , not clinching proof . </s>
<s> On another issue , Greeks were told how their national intelligence agency , the EYP , regularly monitored the telephone conversations of prominent figures , including key opposition politicians , journalists and PASOK cabinet members . </s>
<s> Despite convincing arguments , it was never established that Mr. Papandreou personally ordered or directed the wiretaps . </s>
<s> The central weakness of the `` scandals '' debates was pointed up especially well when discussions focused on arms deals and kickbacks . </s>
<s> The coalition government tried to show that PASOK ministers had received hefty sums for OKing the purchase of F-16 Fighting Falcon and Mirage 2000 combat aircraft , produced by the U.S.based General Dynamics Corp. and France 's Avions Marcel Dassault , respectively . </s>
<s> Naturally , neither General Dynamics nor Dassault could be expected to hamper its prospective future dealings by making disclosures of sums paid -LRB- or not -RRB- to various Greek officials for services rendered . </s>
<s> So it seems that Mr. Mitsotakis and his communist chums may have unwittingly served Mr. Papandreou a moral victory on a platter : PASOK , whether guilty or not , can now traipse the countryside condemning the whole affair as a witch hunt at Mr. Papandreou 's expense . </s>
<s> But while verbal high jinks alone wo n't help PASOK regain power , Mr. Papandreou should never be underestimated . </s>
<s> First came his predictable fusillade : He charged the Coalition of the Left and Progress had sold out its leftist tenets by collaborating in a right-wing plot aimed at ousting PASOK and thwarting the course of socialism in Greece . </s>
<s> Then , to buttress his credibility with the left , he enticed some smaller leftist parties to stand for election under the PASOK banner . </s>
<s> Next , he continued to court the communists -- many of whom feel betrayed by the left-right coalition 's birth -- by bringing into PASOK a well-respected Communist Party candidate . </s>
<s> For balance , and in hopes of gaining some disaffected centrist votes , he managed to attract a former New Democracy Party representative and known political enemy of Mr. Mitsotakis . </s>
<s> Thus PASOK heads for the polls not only with diminished scandal-stench , but also with `` seals of approval '' from representatives of its harshest accusers . </s>
<s> Crucial as these elections are for Greece , pressing issues of state are getting lost in the shuffle . </s>
<s> The country 's future NATO participation remains unsure , for instance . </s>
<s> Greece also must revamp major pieces of legislation in preparation for the 1992 targets of heightened Common Market cooperation . </s>
<s> Greece 's bilateral relations with the U.S. need attention soon as well . </s>
<s> For one , the current accord concerning U.S. military bases in Greece lapses in May 1990 . </s>
<s> Negotiations for a new agreement were frozen before the June elections , but the clock is running . </s>
<s> Another matter of concern is the extradition of Mohammed Rashid , a Palestinian terrorist who is wanted in the U.S. for the 1982 bombing of a Pan American Airways flight . </s>
<s> The Greek courts have decided in favor of extradition in the Rashid case , but the matter awaits final approval from Greece 's next justice minister . </s>
<s> The Greeks seem barely aware of the importance of the case as a litmus test of whether Greece will be counted in or out for international efforts to combat terrorism . </s>
<s> That PASOK could win the elections outright is improbable ; the Greek press , previously eager to palm off PASOK 's line , has turned on Mr. Papandreou with a wild-eyed vengeance . </s>
<s> Yet the possibility of another lash-up government is all too real . </s>
<s> If Mr. Papandreou becomes the major opposition leader , he could hamstring a conservative-led coalition . </s>
<s> Also , he could force new elections early next year by frustrating the procedures for the election of the president of the republic in March . </s>
<s> New Democracy has once again glaringly underestimated the opponent and linked its own prospects to negative reaction against PASOK , forgetting to tend to either program clarity or the rectification of internal squabbles . </s>
<s> As for Mr. Papandreou ? </s>
<s> He 's not exactly sitting pretty at this stage . </s>
<s> But since he is undoubtedly one of the most proficient bull slingers who ever raked muck , it seems far wiser to view him as sidelined , but certainly not yet eliminated . </s>
<s> Mr. Carpenter , a regional correspondent for National Review , has lived in Athens since 1981 . </s>
