<s> For 20 years , federal rules have barred the three major television networks from sharing in one of the most lucrative and fastest-growing parts of the television business . </s>
<s> And for six years , NBC , ABC and CBS have negotiated with Hollywood studios in a futile attempt to change that . </s>
<s> But with foreign companies snapping up U.S. movie studios , the networks are pressing their fight harder than ever . </s>
<s> They hope the foreign deals will divide the Hollywood opposition and prod Congress to push for ending federal rules that prohibit the networks from grabbing a piece of rerun sales and owning part of the shows they put on the air . </s>
<s> Even network executives , however , admit privately that victory -- either in Congress or in talks with the studios -- is highly doubtful any time soon . </s>
<s> And so the networks also are pushing for new ways to sidestep the `` fin-syn '' provisions , known formally as the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules . </s>
<s> That became clear last week with the disclosure that National Broadcasting Co. , backed by the deep pockets of parent General Electric Co. , had tried to help fund Qintex Australia Ltd. 's now-scuttled $ 1.5 billion bid for MGM\/UA Communications Co . </s>
<s> NBC 's interest may revive the deal , which MGM\/UA killed last week when the Australian concern had trouble raising cash . </s>
<s> Even if that deal is n't revived , NBC hopes to find another . </s>
<s> `` Our doors are open , '' an NBC spokesman says . </s>
<s> NBC may yet find a way to take a passive , minority interest in a program-maker without violating the rules . </s>
<s> And any NBC effort could prompt CBS Inc. and ABC 's parent , Capital Cities\/ABC Inc. , to look for ways of skirting the fin-syn regulations . </s>
<s> But the networks ' push may only aggravate an increasingly bitter rift between them and Hollywood studios . </s>
<s> Both sides are to sit down next month for yet another meeting on how they might agree on reducing fin-syn restraints . </s>
<s> Few people privy to the talks expect the studios to budge . </s>
<s> The networks still are `` uninhibited in their authority '' over what shows get on the air , charges Motion Picture Association President Jack Valenti , the most vociferous opponent of rescinding the rules . </s>
<s> Studios are `` powerless '' to get shows in prime-time lineups and keep them there long enough to go into lucrative rerun sales , he contends . </s>
<s> And that 's why the rules , for the most part , must stay in place , he says . </s>
<s> Studio executives in on the talks - including officials at Paramount Communications Inc. , Fries Entertainment Inc. , Warner Communications Inc. and MCA Inc. -- declined to be interviewed . </s>
<s> But Mr. Valenti , who represents the studios , asserts : `` The whole production industry , to a man , is on the side of preserving '' the rules . </s>
<s> Such proclamations leave network officials all the more doubtful that the studios will bend . </s>
<s> `` They do n't seem to have an incentive to negotiate , '' says one network executive . </s>
<s> `` And there 's no indication that Washington is prepared to address the rules . </s>
<s> That 's the problem , is n't it ? '' </s>
<s> Indeed it is . </s>
<s> Congress has said repeatedly it wants no part of the mess , urging the studios and the networks , which license rights to air shows made by the studios , to work out their own compromise . </s>
<s> But recent developments have made the networks -- and NBC President Robert Wright , in particular -- ever more adamant that the networks must be unshackled to survive . </s>
<s> The latest provocation : Sony Corp. 's plan to acquire Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. for $ 3.4 billion , and to buy independent producer Guber Peters Entertainment Co. for $ 200 million . </s>
<s> `` I wonder what Walter Cronkite will think of the Sony\/Columbia Broadcast System Trinitron Evening News with Dan Rather broadcast exclusively from Tokyo , '' wrote J.B. Holston , an NBC vice president , in a commentary in last week 's issue of Broadcasting magazine . </s>
<s> In his article , Mr. Holston , who was in Europe last week and unavailable , complained that the `` archaic restraints '' in fin-syn rules have `` contributed directly to the acquisition of the studios by non-U.S. enterprises . </s>
<s> '' -LRB- He did n't mention that NBC , in the meantime , was hoping to assist Australia 's Qintex in buying </s>
<s> An NBC spokesman counters that Mr. Holston 's lament was `` entirely consistent '' with NBC plans because the U.S. rules would limit NBC 's involvement in the Qintex deal so severely as to be `` light years away from the type of unrestrained deals available to Sony -- and everyone else except the three networks . '' </s>
<s> The Big Three 's drumbeat for deregulation began intensifying in the summer when the former Time Inc. went ahead with plans to acquire Warner . </s>
<s> Although Time already had a long-term contract to buy movies from Warner , the merger will let Time 's largely unregulated pay-cable channel , Home Box Office , own the Warner movies aired on HBO -- a vertical integration that is effectively blocked by fin-syn regulations . </s>
<s> NBC 's Mr. Wright led the way in decrying the networks ' inability to match a Time-Warner combination . </s>
<s> He spoke up again when the Sony bid for Columbia was announced . </s>
<s> Since NBC 's interest in the Qintex bid for MGM\/UA was disclosed , Mr. Wright has n't been available for comment . </s>
<s> With a Qintex deal , NBC would move into uncharted territory -- possibly raising hackles at the studios and in Washington . </s>
<s> `` It 's never really been tested , '' says William Lilley III , who as a top CBS executive spent years lobbying to have the rules lifted . </s>
<s> He now runs Policy Communications in Washington , consulting to media companies . </s>
<s> Fin-syn rules do n't explicitly block a network from buying a passive , small stake in a company that profits from the rerun syndication networks ca n't enjoy . </s>
<s> Hence , NBC might be able to take , say , a 5 % stake in a company such as MGM\/UA . </s>
<s> If the transaction raised objections , the studio 's syndication operations could be spun off into a separate firm in which the network does n't have a direct stake . </s>
<s> But such convolutions would still block the networks from grabbing a big chunk of the riches of syndication . </s>
<s> Under current rules , even when a network fares well with a 100%-owned series -- ABC , for example , made a killing in broadcasting its popular crime\/comedy `` Moonlighting '' -- it is n't allowed to share in the continuing proceeds when the reruns are sold to local stations . </s>
<s> Instead , ABC will have to sell off the rights for a one-time fee . </s>
<s> The networks admit that the chances of getting the relief they want are slim -- for several years at the least . </s>
<s> Six years ago they were tantalizingly close . </s>
<s> The Reagan-era Federal Communications Commission had ruled in favor of killing most of the rules . </s>
<s> Various evidence , including a Brookings Institution study of some 800 series that the networks had aired and had partly owned in the 1960s , showed the networks did n't wield undue control over the studios as had been alleged . </s>
<s> But just eight days before the rules were to die , former President Ronald Reagan , a one-time actor , intervened on behalf of Hollywood . </s>
<s> The FCC effort collapsed . </s>
<s> The networks and studios have bickered ever since . </s>
<s> Network officials involved in the studio talks may hope the foreign influx builds more support in Washington , but that seems unlikely . </s>
<s> In Congress , the issue falters : It 's about money , not program quality , and Hollywood has lots of clout given its fund raising for senators and representatives overseeing the issue . </s>
<s> A spokesman for Rep. Edward J. Markey -LRB- D-Mass. -RRB- , who heads a subcommittee that oversees the FCC , says Mr. Markey feels `` the world has been forever changed by the Sony-Columbia deal . '' </s>
<s> But he said Mr. Markey hopes this pushes the networks and studios to work it out on their own . </s>
<s> And at the FCC , meanwhile , new Chairman Alfred C. Sikes has said he wants the two sides to hammer out their own plan . </s>
