<s> The economy 's temperature will be taken from several vantage points this week , with readings on trade , output , housing and inflation . </s>
<s> The most troublesome report may be the August merchandise trade deficit due out tomorrow . </s>
<s> The trade gap is expected to widen to about $ 9 billion from July 's $ 7.6 billion , according to a survey by MMS International , a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc. , New York . </s>
<s> Thursday 's report on the September consumer price index is expected to rise , although not as sharply as the 0.9 % gain reported Friday in the producer price index . </s>
<s> That gain was being cited as a reason the stock market was down early in Friday 's session , before it got started on its reckless 190-point plunge . </s>
<s> Economists are divided as to how much manufacturing strength they expect to see in September reports on industrial production and capacity utilization , also due tomorrow . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , September housing starts , due Wednesday , are thought to have inched upward . </s>
<s> `` There 's a possibility of a surprise '' in the trade report , said Michael Englund , director of research at MMS . </s>
<s> A widening of the deficit , if it were combined with a stubbornly strong dollar , would exacerbate trade problems -- but the dollar weakened Friday as stocks plummeted . </s>
<s> In any event , Mr. Englund and many others say that the easy gains in narrowing the trade gap have already been made . </s>
<s> `` Trade is definitely going to be more politically sensitive over the next six or seven months as improvement begins to slow , '' he said . </s>
<s> Exports are thought to have risen strongly in August , but probably not enough to offset the jump in imports , economists said . </s>
<s> Views on manufacturing strength are split between economists who read September 's low level of factory job growth as a sign of a slowdown and those who use the somewhat more comforting total employment figures in their calculations . </s>
<s> The wide range of estimates for the industrial output number underscores the differences : The forecasts run from a drop of 0.5 % to an increase of 0.4 % , according to MMS . </s>
<s> A rebound in energy prices , which helped push up the producer price index , is expected to do the same in the consumer price report . </s>
<s> The consensus view expects a 0.4 % increase in the September CPI after a flat reading in August . </s>
<s> Robert H. Chandross , an economist for Lloyd 's Bank in New York , is among those expecting a more moderate gain in the CPI than in prices at the producer level . </s>
<s> `` Auto prices had a big effect in the PPI , and at the CPI level they wo n't , '' he said . </s>
<s> Food prices are expected to be unchanged , but energy costs jumped as much as 4 % , said Gary Ciminero , economist at Fleet\/Norstar Financial Group . </s>
<s> He also says he thinks `` core inflation , '' which excludes the volatile food and energy prices , was strong last month . </s>
<s> He expects a gain of as much as 0.5 % in core inflation after a summer of far smaller increases . </s>
<s> Housing starts are expected to quicken a bit from August 's annual pace of 1,350,000 units . </s>
<s> Economists say an August rebound in permits for multifamily units signaled an increase in September starts , though activity remains fairly modest by historical standards . </s>
