<s> Common Cause asked both the Senate Ethics Committee and the Justice Department to investigate $ 1 million in political gifts by Arizona businessman Charles Keating to five U.S. senators who interceded with thrift-industry regulators for him . </s>
<s> Mr. Keating is currently the subject of a $ 1.1 billion federal anti-racketeering lawsuit accusing him of bleeding off assets of a California thrift he controlled , Lincoln Savings & Loan Association , and driving it into insolvency . </s>
<s> Fred Wertheimer -- president of Common Cause , the self-styled citizens lobby -- said Mr. Keating already has conceded attempting to buy influence with the lawmakers -- Democratic Sens. Dennis DeConcini of Arizona , Alan Cranston of California , John Glenn of Ohio and Donald Riegle of Michigan ; and GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona . </s>
<s> Mr. Wertheimer based this on a statement by Mr. Keating that was quoted in a Wall Street Journal story in April : `` One question ... had to do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my cause . </s>
<s> I want to say in the most forceful way I can : I certainly hope so . '' </s>
<s> In a highly unusual meeting in Sen. DeConcini 's office in April 1987 , the five senators asked federal regulators to ease up on Lincoln . </s>
<s> According to notes taken by one of the participants at the meeting , the regulators said Lincoln was gambling dangerously with depositors ' federally insured money and was `` a ticking time bomb . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Keating had complained that the regulators were being too zealous . </s>
<s> The notes show that Sen. DeConcini called the Federal Home Loan Bank Board 's regulations `` grossly unfair , '' and that Sen. Glenn insisted that Mr. Keating 's thrift was `` viable and profitable . '' </s>
<s> For the next two years , the Bank Board , which at the time was the agency responsible for regulating thrifts , failed to act -- even after federal auditors warned in May 1987 that Mr. Keating had caused Lincoln to become insolvent . </s>
<s> Lincoln 's parent company , American Continental Corp. , entered bankruptcy-law proceedings this April 13 , and regulators seized the thrift the next day . </s>
<s> The newly formed Resolution Trust Corp. , successor to the Bank Board , filed suit against Mr. Keating and several others on Sept. 15 . </s>
<s> Mr. Keating has filed his own suit , alleging that his property was taken illegally . </s>
<s> The cost to taxpayers of Lincoln 's collapse has been estimated at as much as $ 2.5 billion . </s>
<s> Details of the affair have become public gradually over the past two years , mostly as a result of reporting by several newspapers . </s>
<s> In the midst of his 1988 re-election campaign , Sen. Riegle , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , returned $ 76,000 in contributions after a Detroit newspaper said that Mr. Keating had gathered the money for him about two weeks before the meeting with regulators . </s>
<s> Sen. DeConcini , after months of fending off intense press criticism , returned $ 48,000 only last month , shortly after the government formally accused Mr. Keating of defrauding Lincoln . </s>
<s> In addition , Sen. McCain last week disclosed that he belatedly had paid $ 13,433 to American Continental as reimbursement for trips he and his family took aboard the corporate jet to Mr. Keating 's vacation home at Cat Cay , the Bahamas , from 1984 through 1986 . </s>
<s> Sen. McCain said he had meant to pay for the trips at the time but that the matter `` fell between the cracks . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Keating , his family members and associates also donated $ 112,000 to Sen. McCain 's congressional campaigns over the years , according to press accounts . </s>
<s> But Sen. McCain says Mr. Keating broke off their friendship abruptly in 1987 , because the senator refused to press the thrift executive 's case as vigorously as Mr. Keating wanted . </s>
<s> `` He became very angry at that , left my office and told a number of people that I was a wimp , '' Sen. McCain recalls . </s>
<s> In July , California newspapers disclosed that Mr. Keating gave $ 850,000 in corporate funds to three tax-exempt voter registration organizations in 1987 and 1988 at the behest of Sen. Cranston , who conceded that soliciting the money was `` a pretty stupid thing to do politically . '' </s>
<s> In addition , Sen. Cranston received $ 47,000 in campaign donations through Mr. Keating , and the California Democratic party received $ 85,000 in corporate donations for a 1986 get-out-the-vote drive that benefited the senator 's re-election campaign that year . </s>
<s> Also in July , Ohio newspapers disclosed $ 200,000 in corporate donations by Mr. Keating to the National Council on Public Policy , a political committee controlled by Sen. Glenn . </s>
<s> That was in addition to $ 34,000 in direct campaign donations arranged by Mr. Keating to the Ohio senator . </s>
<s> Mr. Wertheimer said the Senate Ethics Committee should hire a special outside counsel to conduct an investigation , as was done in the case of former House Speaker James Wright . </s>
<s> Wilson Abney , staff director of the ethics panel , would n't comment . </s>
<s> Sen. Riegle said he would cooperate with any inquiry , but that his conduct had been `` entirely proper . '' </s>
<s> Sen. McCain said he had been `` deeply concerned '' at the time of the meeting that it might seem to be improper , but decided it was `` entirely appropriate '' for him to seek fair treatment for a constituent . </s>
<s> Sen. Glenn said he had already made a complete disclosure of his role in the affair and `` I am completely satisfied to let this matter rest in the hands of the Senate Ethics Committee . '' </s>
<s> Sen. DeConcini said , `` When all is said and done , I expect to be fully exonerated . '' </s>
<s> Sen. Cranston , who had already volunteered his help to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in any investigation of Mr. Keating , portrayed his role in 1987 as prodding regulators to act . </s>
<s> `` Why did n't the Bank Board act sooner ? '' he said . </s>
<s> `` That is what Common Cause should ask be investigated . </s>
