<s> The debate over National Service has begun again . </s>
<s> After a decade in which more than 50 localities established their own service or conservation corps and dozens of school systems made community service a prerequisite to high-school graduation , the focus has shifted to Washington . </s>
<s> At least 10 bills proposing one or another national program were introduced in Congress this spring . </s>
<s> One , co-sponsored by Sen. Sam Nunn -LRB- D. , Ga . -RRB- and Rep. Dave McCurdy -LRB- D. , Okla. -RRB- , would have restricted federal college subsidies to students who had served . </s>
<s> An omnibus bill assembled by Sen. Edward Kennedy -LRB- D. , Mass. -RRB- , and including some diluted Nunn-McCurdy provisions along with proposals by fellow Democratic Sens. Claiborne Pell , Barbara Mikulski and Christopher Dodd , has been reported out of the Senate Labor Committee . </s>
<s> It might well win Senate passage . </s>
<s> President Bush has outlined his own Youth Entering Service -LRB- YES -RRB- plan , though its details remain to be specified . </s>
<s> What is one to think of all this ? </s>
<s> Doctrine and special interests govern some responses . </s>
<s> People eager to have youth `` pay their dues to society '' favor service proposals -- preferably mandatory ones . </s>
<s> So do those who seek a `` re-energized concept of citizenship , '' a concept imposing stern obligations as well as conferring rights . </s>
<s> Then there are instinctive opponents . </s>
<s> To libertarians , mandatory service is an abomination and voluntary systems are illegitimate uses of tax money . </s>
<s> Devotees of the market question the value of the work national service would perform : </s>
<s> If the market wo n't pay for it , they argue , it ca n't be worth its cost . </s>
<s> Elements of the left are also reflexively opposed ; they see service as a cover for the draft , or fear the regimentation of youth , or want to see rights enlarged , not obligations . </s>
<s> But what about those of us whose views are not predetermined by formula or ideology ? </s>
<s> How should we think about national service ? </s>
<s> Let 's begin by recognizing a main source of confusion -- `` national service '' has no agreed meaning . </s>
<s> Would service be voluntary or compulsory ? </s>
<s> Short or long ? </s>
<s> Part-time or full-time ? </s>
<s> Paid or unpaid ? </s>
<s> Would participants live at home and work nearby or live in barracks and work on public lands ? </s>
<s> What kinds of work would they do ? </s>
<s> What does `` national '' mean ? </s>
<s> Would the program be run by the federal government , by local governments , or by private voluntary organizations ? </s>
<s> And who would serve ? </s>
<s> Only males , as with the draft , or both sexes ? </s>
<s> Youth only or all ages ? </s>
<s> Middle-class people , or poor people , or a genuine cross-section ? </s>
<s> Many or few ? </s>
<s> Those are not trivial questions , and the label `` national service '' answers none of them . </s>
<s> Then how should we think about national service ? </s>
<s> As a starting point , here are five propositions : 1 . Consider the ingredients , not the name . </s>
<s> Ignore `` national service '' in the abstract ; consider specific proposals . </s>
<s> They will differ in crucial ways . </s>
<s> 2 . `` Service '' should be service . </s>
<s> As commonly understood , service implies sacrifice . </s>
<s> It involves accepting risk , or giving up income , or deferring a career . </s>
<s> It follows that proposals like Nunn-McCurdy , whose benefits to enrollees are worth some $ 17,500 a year , do not qualify . </s>
<s> There is a rationale for such bills : Federal subsidies to college students amount to `` a GI Bill without the GI '' ; arguably those benefits should be earned , not given . </s>
<s> But the earnings exceed by 20 % the average income of young high-school graduates with full-time jobs . </s>
<s> Why call that service ? </s>
<s> 3 . Encouragement is fine ; compulsion is not . </s>
<s> Compelled service is unconstitutional . </s>
<s> It is also unwise and unenforceable . </s>
<s> -LRB- Who will throw several hundred thousand refusers in jail each year ? -RRB- </s>
<s> But through tax policy and in other ways the federal government encourages many kinds of behavior . </s>
<s> It should also encourage service -- preferably by all classes and all ages . </s>
<s> Its encouragement should strengthen and not undercut the strong tradition of volunteering in the U.S. , should build on the service programs already in existence , and should honor local convictions about which tasks most need doing . </s>
<s> 4 . Good programs are not cheap . </s>
<s> Enthusiasts assume that national service would get important work done cheaply : forest fires fought , housing rehabilitated , students tutored , day-care centers staffed . </s>
<s> There is important work to be done , and existing service and conservation corps have shown that even youths who start with few skills can do much of it well -- but not cheaply . </s>
<s> Good service programs require recruitment , screening , training and supervision -- all of high quality . </s>
<s> They involve stipends to participants . </s>
<s> Full-time residential programs also require housing and full-time supervision ; they are particularly expensive -- more per participant than a year at Stanford or Yale . </s>
<s> Non-residential programs are cheaper , but good ones still come to some $ 10,000 a year . </s>
<s> Are they worth that ? </s>
<s> Evaluations suggest that good ones are -- especially so if the effects on participants are counted . </s>
<s> But the calculations are challengeable . </s>
<s> 5 . Underclass youth are a special concern . </s>
<s> Are such expenditures worthwhile , then ? </s>
<s> Yes , if targeted . </s>
<s> People of all ages and all classes should be encouraged to serve , but there are many ways for middle-class kids , and their elders , to serve at little public cost . </s>
<s> They can volunteer at any of thousands of non-profit institutions , or participate in service programs required by high schools or encouraged by colleges or employers . </s>
<s> Underclass youth do n't have those opportunities . </s>
<s> They are not enrolled in high school or college . </s>
<s> They are unlikely to be employed . </s>
<s> And they have grown up in unprecedentedly grim circumstances , among family structures breaking down , surrounded by self-destructive behaviors and bleak prospects . </s>
<s> But many of them can be quite profoundly reoriented by productive and disciplined service . </s>
<s> Some wo n't accept the discipline ; others drop out for other reasons . </s>
<s> But some whom nothing else is reaching are transformed . </s>
<s> Learning skills , producing something cooperatively , feeling useful , they are no longer dependent -- others now depend on them . </s>
<s> Even if it is cheaper to build playgrounds or paint apartments or plant dune-grass with paid professionals , the effects on the young people providing those services alter the calculation . </s>
<s> Strictly speaking , these youth are not performing service . </s>
<s> They are giving up no income , deferring no careers , incurring no risk . </s>
<s> But they believe themselves to be serving , and they begin to respect themselves -LRB- and others -RRB- , to take control of their lives , to think of the future . </s>
<s> That is a service to the nation . </s>
<s> It is what federal support should try hardest to achieve . </s>
<s> Mr. Szanton , a Carter administration budget official , heads his own Washington-based strategic planning firm . </s>
<s> He is a co-author of `` National Service : What Would It Mean ? '' </s>
