<s> `` The New Crowd '' by Judith Ramsey Ehrlich and Barry J. Rehfeld -LRB- Little , Brown , 444 pages , $ 19.95 -RRB- , describes the displacing of the old `` our crowd '' Jewish Wall Street banking grandees by such new business barons as Saul Steinberg , Carl Icahn , Sanford Weill and Bruce Wasserstein . </s>
<s> Its many lively stories include the Gutfreund-Postel holiday cheer imbroglio . </s>
<s> These two New Crowd families lived in the same apartment building , with the Postel penthouse perched on top of the Gutfreund duplex . </s>
<s> The penthouse elevator started up from the Gutfreund landing , and Susan Gutfreund used to turn off its light , to give the impression that there was no higher floor . </s>
<s> Eventually , Mr. Postel broke his toe in the dark . </s>
<s> Then the Gutfreunds determined to put up a 22-foot Christmas tree , weighing a quarter of a ton , to amaze their holiday guests . </s>
<s> For this , a crane needed to be mounted on the Postels ' terrace . </s>
<s> The Postels did not give permission . </s>
<s> But the Gutfreund workers went ahead anyway , only to be captured `` in flagrante '' by Joan Postel , who called the police . </s>
<s> Before the Gutfreunds finally left this unfriendly environment for a prodigious duplex on Fifth Avenue and an 18th-century mansion with a specially excavated $ 1 million garage in Paris , the Postels had obtained an injunction to prevent any future hoisting of trees , and in a neighborly spirit hit both the Gutfreunds and the building with a $ 35 million lawsuit . </s>
<s> Nothing less , it seemed , could console them for their traumas . </s>
<s> Where had all the money come from ? </s>
<s> The young John Gutfreund had been discovered by Billy Salomon of Salomon Bros. when he was still a bearded liberal , and put to work as a trader , and then as a rough-and-tumble syndicator . </s>
<s> `` ` Get off your ... , ' he would bellow , '' say the authors . </s>
<s> Rising in the firm , he became powerful and bland , though his new wife , Susan , made him shine in the gossip columns with her profligate spending habits and flamboyant frocks . </s>
<s> After he had been head of the company for 3 1\/2 years , he and his partners sold it to Phibro , a powerful commodity trading outfit , for $ 550 million in Phibro stock . </s>
<s> Limited partner Billy Salomon , whose family name had been on the firm 's door for 70 years and who had hoped it would be there forever , was not consulted . </s>
<s> Mr. Gutfreund collected $ 32 million , while Billy Salomon got $ 10 million , much less than if he had conducted the sale . </s>
<s> `` I felt betrayed , '' he later said . </s>
<s> Worse , Salomon 's timing had been off . </s>
<s> Its profits , unlike Phibro 's , soared over the next two years , and had it held out , Salomon could have gotten an even bigger bundle . </s>
<s> The book also recounts the not dissimilar maneuvers surrounding the changing of the guard at Lehman Bros. and other grand old firms . </s>
<s> Often the genteel , conservative , long-term-oriented investment bankers were displaced by crude traders : `` When angered , he cursed so forcefully that his face reddened and his pale-blue eyes narrowed into tiny slits , '' the authors say of Lehman 's Lewis Glucksman . </s>
<s> The earlier generation of `` our crowd '' bankers -- Belmonts , Warburgs , Lehmans , Baches and Schiffs -- had stressed above all probity , tradition , continuity and reputation . </s>
<s> They were old-fashioned elegant gentlemen , who happened to be of German Jewish extraction . </s>
<s> But in the harsh world of today 's Wall Street they have lost out to more aggressive and sometimes less scrupulous successors . </s>
<s> The cuckoo prefers the nests of other birds and heaves out their eggs . </s>
<s> But the old guard hired the New Crowd people : It brought in its own cuckoos . </s>
<s> So , as the Old Crowd toppled from the branch , it should n't have been too surprised . </s>
<s> The old guard had every right , however , to disdain the newcomers ' new ways of making money , such as greenmail . </s>
<s> -LRB- A Fortune article on Saul Steinberg was entitled , `` Fear and Loathing in the Corporate Boardrooms . '' -RRB- </s>
<s> Their other staple has been corporate takeovers , often hostile and financed by junk bonds . </s>
<s> Hostile takeovers are quite a new phenomenon . </s>
<s> Sometimes they are constructive , but often not . </s>
<s> First , by making management focus on short-term results , they inhibit building for the future -- just the opposite of Japan . </s>
<s> Second , a long-term shareholder of a good company need n't worry too much when the stock price drops temporarily : It will bounce back . </s>
<s> But if a raider takes over when the stock is weak , the shareholder never gets his recovery . </s>
<s> The raiders , meanwhile , have evolved their own pattern for spending their new millions . </s>
<s> As described in `` The New Crowd , '' they take on ambitious new wives , move to Greenwich , Conn. , or Bedford , N.Y. , buy OK pictures , and let their wives share the wealth with decorators . </s>
<s> Having donated heavily to museums , they demand a place on their boards . </s>
<s> The book is patronizing about this nouveau riche struggle for respectability , which has its tawdry aspects . </s>
<s> However , on balance , the charity game helps America . </s>
<s> If those who have the money do n't get involved with the museums and the charities , then City Hall will do it , badly . </s>
<s> It has been rightly observed that the main thing wrong with tainted money is , t' ai nt enough of it . </s>
<s> A handful of the New Crowd operators have crossed the line from the immoral to the illegal , and have ended up in the slammer or paying huge fines : </s>
<s> Ivan Boesky , Dennis Levine , Martin Siegel , Victor and Steven Posner , and now Michael Milken and perhaps Leona Helmsley . </s>
<s> The glitzy office that Ivan Boesky vacated for a prison cell had previously contained commodity operators Marc Rich and `` Pinky '' Green , today fugitives from a potential century apiece of jail sentences . </s>
<s> The Old Crowd is deeply concerned by the backlash from all this . </s>
<s> However , the phenomenon is not specifically Jewish . </s>
<s> It has always been true that those outside the club want to climb in , and that a few will cut corners in the process . </s>
<s> Some pretty seamy stuff built the turn-of-the-century families ' Fifth Avenue and Newport palazzi and endowed their daughters ' weddings to foreign noblemen . </s>
<s> Mr. Boesky was a piker compared to Jay Gould and Jim Fiske , and Commodore Vanderbilt thought nothing of bribing judges and legislators . </s>
<s> So who knows ? </s>
<s> In a generation or two some of the New Crowd may attain true respectability , perhaps to be displaced in turn by a later flock of unscrupulous raptors . </s>
<s> Or perhaps Wall Street , when it has suffered enough , will realize that finance is a service industry , and change its ethos . </s>
<s> Mr. Train is president of Train , Smith Investment Counsel , New York . </s>
