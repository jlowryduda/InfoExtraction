<s> The Tennessee Valley Authority issued $ 4 billion in bonds in the federal utility 's first public debt offering in 15 years . </s>
<s> Proceeds from the bonds , with coupon rates in the 8 % range , will be used to replace bonds with an average interest rate of 13.1 % . </s>
<s> The TVA said the refinancing should save $ 75 million a year in interest payments . </s>
<s> The refinancing is part of the TVA 's strategy of dealing with what has been an intractable problem : its staggering $ 18.5 billion debt , most of which is owed to the Treasury Department 's Federal Financing Bank . </s>
<s> The TVA currently plans to issue a total of $ 6.7 billion in bonds to refinance its high-interest debt . </s>
<s> The $ 4 billion bond issue also will help the TVA meet its goal of not raising rates for another year , said William F. Malec , the agency 's chief financial officer . </s>
<s> The bond issue is TVA 's first public offering since the Financing Bank was created in 1974 , primarily to finance the TVA . </s>
<s> But the offering almost did n't happen . </s>
<s> The TVA , in fact , decided to proceed with the bond offering following an agreement last week with the Financing Bank , which allows TVA to keep borrowing short term from the bank for two years after it goes to the public market . </s>
<s> The Treasury contended that TVA could n't borrow from both it and the public debt market . </s>
<s> The $ 4 billion in bonds break down as follows : $ 1 billion in five-year bonds with a coupon rate of 8.25 % and a yield to maturity of 8.33 % ; $ 1 billion in 10-year bonds with a coupon rate of 8.375 % and a yield to maturity of 8.42 % ; $ 2 billion in 30-year bonds with five-year call protection , a coupon rate of 8.75 % and a yield to maturity of 9.06 % . </s>
<s> Managing the bond issue is a group of investment banks headed by First Boston Corp. and co-managed by Goldman , Sachs & Co. , Merrill Lynch Capital Markets , Morgan Stanley & Co. , and Salomon Brothers Inc . </s>
