<s> The lethal shudders that wracked the San Francisco Bay Area -- rated a 6.9 on the Richter scale -- did n't match the great earthquake of 1906 , rated at 8.25 . </s>
<s> The difference of just 1.35 points on the scale , designed by Charles Richter of CalTech in the 1930s , means the older quake was `` 10 to 20 times stronger , '' says Lane Johnson , director of the University of California Berkeley Seismographic Station . </s>
<s> The ground ruptured along a 20-to-30-mile stretch of the San Andreas Fault on Tuesday , Mr. Johnson added . </s>
<s> In 1906 , the rupture was 300 miles long and a couple feet wide . </s>
<s> Though the epicenter of Tuesday 's temblor was located 10 miles north of the town of Santa Cruz , and 50 miles south of San Francisco , its havoc hopscotched up the coast in seemingly random fashion . </s>
<s> But the greatest damage was visited on buildings and roadways perched upon landfill , as were the Marina District of San Francisco and the Bay Bridge -- two areas of maximum devastation . </s>
<s> `` Landfill -- loose and unconsolidated earth -- may feel like rock but it behaves like liquid when you shake it , '' said Douglas Segar , professor of geosciences at San Francisco State University in a televised interview . </s>
<s> `` It liquefies in a patchwork quilt pattern . </s>
<s> Our quake behaved much like the Mexico City earthquake , where great damage was miles from the epicenter . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Johnson , of the Berkeley seismographic station , said : `` Landfill can be done if it 's properly compacted . </s>
<s> You can drive piles on it and build on it . '' </s>
<s> He cited the example of San Francisco 's financial district , where many new glass towers survived almost unscathed . </s>
<s> But the public policy issues raised by earthquake damage will be difficult to address , Mr. Johnson predicted . </s>
<s> `` The attention span of the public is short , '' he said . </s>
<s> `` We 've known for years and years we 've got lots of old -LCB- pre-1950s -RCB- unreinforced brick and masonry buildings . '' </s>
<s> One old building , the Golden State Bank Building on Front Street , had its yellow brick facade sheared off by the shock of the quake , leaving a wedge of its third floor open to the air , while piles of dusty bricks tumbled to the street below narrowly missing rush-hour pedestrians and cars . </s>
<s> Reinforcing such old building stock , Mr. Johnson said , `` comes down to money . </s>
<s> It 's a danger . </s>
<s> We know it 's there . </s>
<s> And sooner or later , we have to do something about it . '' </s>
<s> The urgency is heightened because this week 's earthquake -- while major and followed by hundreds of aftershocks -- did n't release enough pent-up energy tension along the faultlines to preclude more and bigger quakes soon . </s>
<s> `` The big one is still due , '' Mr. Johnson predicted in an interview . </s>
<s> `` The Bay Area has three very dangerous faults , the San Andreas , the Hayward fault and the Calaveras fault . </s>
<s> It -LCB- Tuesday 's quake -RCB- has n't solved our problem . </s>
<s> In California , this is the reality . </s>
