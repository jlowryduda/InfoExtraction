<s> In August , soon after Wang Laboratories Inc. reported a staggering $ 424.3 million loss and replaced its president , two Boston sales representatives sent customers a letter saying : `` We fully expect that you will soon be reading stories in the press reporting the ` Amazing Comeback at Wang . ' '' </s>
<s> How soon Wang will stage a comeback , or if it will at all , are still matters of debate . </s>
<s> But Wang salespeople are trying to cope with the biggest challenge any marketer can face : selling the products of a company that is on the ropes . </s>
<s> `` If your prospect is feeling risk the whole time and you 're not feeling as if you 're backed up by a stable company , you 've lost it before you 've begun , '' says Mary Ann Cluggish , a Wellesley , Mass. , sales trainer and consultant who works with high technology companies . </s>
<s> It can happen in any industry . </s>
<s> Consider the difficulties faced by Audi salespeople when the car was tainted by false charges of sudden acceleration , or Exxon dealers ' problems in the wake of the Valdez oil spill . </s>
<s> Like thousands of salespeople before them , Wang 's are finding ways to combat the bad news . </s>
<s> `` It 's very important that we exude confidence , even though within the family we know there 's a lot of hard work ahead , '' said Richard Miller , the Lowell , Mass. , computer concern 's new president , in a video message to salespeople a month after he took over . </s>
<s> Wang got into financial trouble because of bloated overhead and overly optimistic sales forecasts . </s>
<s> Its mainline minicomputers and word processors have lost ground to cheaper personal computers . </s>
<s> Last year it funded its high employment by heavy borrowing , and it suffered huge losses when sales turned down instead of rising . </s>
<s> After the company reported red ink for the fiscal third quarter , Wang 's marketing department provided the sales force answers to questions such as `` How could you not have known you were going to lose $ 55 million ? '' and `` Is Wang still a viable company ? '' </s>
<s> Salespeople try to push their products and avoid discussions of finances . </s>
<s> Responding to such questions is `` defensive , '' says Kenneth Olissa , Wang 's vice president , marketing . </s>
<s> `` That 's antithetical to the art of selling . '' </s>
<s> Moreover , he notes that analyzing financial results `` poses a problem for a salesman who is n't particularly familiar with a balance sheet . '' </s>
<s> At one sales strategy meeting , an executive suggested ordering salespeople to become experts on the annual report . </s>
<s> Mr. Miller vetoed that : `` Even I ca n't understand all the footnotes , '' he says . </s>
<s> Instead , he says , if the salespeople can get the customers to consider Wang 's products on their merits , he or a top financial officer will try to assuage the fears about finances . </s>
<s> Mike Metschan , a salesman in Wang 's Austin , Texas , office , has a breezier method : `` We tell them $ 3 billion companies do n't go out of business . </s>
<s> We tell them all the major companies are having financial difficulties . '' </s>
<s> Numerous computer companies are having sales slumps and earnings declines , but very few have had losses comparable to Wang 's or are carrying such a large debt load . </s>
<s> Mr. Miller says that after a sharp sales slump in July and August , sales stabilized in September . </s>
<s> Although Wang will report a loss for the first quarter ended Sept. 30 and the full fiscal year , Mr. Miller says he expects the company will return to profitability by the fourth quarter . </s>
<s> Experts on sales technique say anyone representing a troubled company must walk a fine line . </s>
<s> `` If a salesman jeopardizes his credibility in this time of trouble , it will be a problem for the long run , '' says George Palmatier , a Minden , Nev. , sales consultant and author of `` The Marketing Edge . '' </s>
<s> Still , says John Sullivan , a management recruiter with Daniel Roberts Inc. of Boston , who has held senior sales positions at Polaroid and Atari : `` The customer will react to strength . </s>
<s> Ignore the present condition . </s>
<s> Show it 's business as usual . '' </s>
<s> That is n't easy . </s>
<s> Wang 's customers are data processing managers who want to be sure that their suppliers are stable , wellrun companies that will be around to fix bugs and upgrade computers for years to come . </s>
<s> For buyers , `` these are career-risking decisions , '' says Jean Conlin , who supervises a network of Wang computers in the admissions department at Boston University . </s>
<s> The university is considering installing a $ 250,000 system to store applications electronically . </s>
<s> `` Before the really bad news , we were looking at Wang fairly seriously , '' she says . </s>
<s> But `` their present financial condition means I 'd have a hard time convincing the vice president in charge of purchasing . '' </s>
<s> Ms. Conlin adds : `` At some point we 'd have to ask , ` How do we know that in three years you wo n't be in Chapter 11 ? ' '' </s>
<s> During the past year , Wang has developed new products and a new strategy and hired a new president . </s>
<s> Wang 's overall product line is `` still not as good as other vendors , but they 've come a long way , '' says Steven Wendler , a consultant with market researcher Gartner Group , Stamford , Conn . </s>
<s> `` They were on the road to recovery in terms of customer attitudes until this bad quarter happened . '' </s>
<s> The first priority for Wang 's sales force is to make sure it holds on to existing customers . </s>
<s> Wang 's installed base is one of its greatest assets , and many of those customers remain extremely loyal . </s>
<s> But even before Wang 's latest financial troubles surfaced , some customers `` were trying to wall off their Wang installations '' so other departments would n't add Wang , says Chris Christiansen , a former Wang marketer who is now a market analyst with Meta Group , a market research firm in Stamford , Conn . </s>
<s> One Wang salesman who left the company in July recalls that when he tried to sell products to Eastman Kodak , he worked `` to muster support from internal allies , '' but `` those allies became skeptical as they saw the downtrend . </s>
<s> The more recent losses were really devastating . '' </s>
<s> New customers , the source of higher commissions for salespeople and the key to Wang 's long-term viability , are even tougher . </s>
<s> Rick Lynch , a former top salesman in Wang 's Boston office , referring to Wang 's mainstay computer line , says : `` You ca n't sell a VS to a new customer . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Lynch left Wang this summer for Oracle Systems Inc. , a software vendor . </s>
<s> The financial problems are particularly frustrating for salespeople pushing Wang 's image systems , which convert paper forms to electronic documents . </s>
<s> Consultants say that Wang 's technology is among the best available in the image market . </s>
<s> But salespeople often found that news of Wang 's problems superseded their sales efforts . </s>
<s> William Tait , a former sales manager in Indianapolis , says that his office had all but sold a $ 1.5 million image system to pharmaceutical maker Eli Lilly & Co . </s>
<s> `` When they were making the decision , all hell broke loose with the finances . '' </s>
<s> He says the Lilly executives told him they could n't take the risk with Wang . </s>
<s> Mr. Tait say he does n't blame Lilly . </s>
<s> Buyers have to rely on a supplier `` continually upgrading and replacing the product , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` When a company realizes that , it 's hard to go with Wang . '' </s>
<s> For Mr. Tait , who says he used to earn as much as $ 150,000 a year at Wang , it was one more reason to quit . </s>
<s> He is now president of Eastate Homes Inc. , an Indianapolis contractor . </s>
<s> It can be hard for a salesperson to fight off feelings of discouragement . </s>
<s> Brian Petre , a former Wang salesman in upstate New York , says : `` You have pride in your job . </s>
<s> You think you can go out and turn things around . </s>
<s> It 's a tough thing when you ca n't . </s>
<s> The reason does n't relate to your selling skills . '' </s>
<s> Discouragement feeds on itself . </s>
<s> `` The problem is , if people get down in the dumps , they stop selling , '' says Mike Durcan , a laid-off sales manager in Wang 's Austin office . </s>
<s> One key for salespeople is to boost their own morale . </s>
<s> Paul Hellman , a Framingham , Mass. , sales and management consultant and author of `` Ready , Aim , You 're Hired , '' says : `` The bad news is , you 'll be rejected more . </s>
<s> The good news is , it 's not your fault . '' </s>
<s> So , he advises , make goals achievable . </s>
<s> For instance , he suggests that salespeople making telephone calls should say to themselves : `` All I want to do today is get 50 rejections . '' </s>
<s> But Mr. Miller , Wang 's new president , recently warned his salespeople about negativism . </s>
<s> `` Our customers watch us for the hidden message , '' he said . </s>
<s> `` Look a customer right in the eye and say , ` I 'm glad to be at Wang . </s>
