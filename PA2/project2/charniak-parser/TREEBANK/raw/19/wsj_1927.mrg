<s> Whether or not `` great cases make bad-law '' -- as Justice Holmes asserted -- who can doubt that when great confirmation hearings turn on the nominee 's response to these great cases they make bad judicial history ? </s>
<s> Ethan Bronner 's `` Battle for Justice : How the Bork Nomination Shook America '' -LRB- Norton , 399 pages , $ 22.50 -RRB- is a spirited narrative of the nastiest of these hearings , done with journalistic verve , but with a flawed legal philosophy . </s>
<s> While the book amply justifies its subtitle , the title itself is dubious . </s>
<s> What shook America was not a battle for justice but for naked power , in which an army of judicial activists rolled over a judge they had demonized . </s>
<s> In its basic structure and style the book is novelistic , with piquant character portrayal , hard-wire action and devious intrigue of the sort more likely to be encountered in a Washington docudrama than in a constitutional history . </s>
<s> Mr. Bronner seems to believe that the hearings could have gone either way . </s>
<s> I doubt that . </s>
<s> Given Democratic frustration with the Reagan victories and Court appointments , the contingency plans in place , and Mr. Bork 's paper trail of vulnerable writings , it was pretty clear that Judge Bork never stood much chance of being confirmed . </s>
<s> As Mr. Bronner himself says , the smell of `` raw meat '' was in the air . </s>
<s> Perhaps because they won , Mr. Bork 's attackers come through more vividly than his defenders . </s>
<s> Ralph Neas was the organizing genius , whipping a conglomerate of pressure groups into an irresistible attacking force . </s>
<s> Harvard 's Laurence Tribe was the constitutional heavy , laying out legal strategies for the senators and witnesses to follow . </s>
<s> But it was Ted Kennedy who scored most effectively with his searing portrayal of `` Robert Bork 's America '' -- the parade of imaginary horribles that would follow logically , he claimed , from the positions Mr. Bork had taken over the space of two decades . </s>
<s> Sen. Kennedy , never mind his dubious credentials for the moral high ground , emoted brilliantly . </s>
<s> I add two others . </s>
<s> Republican Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania engaged the nominee in a verbal contest aimed at showing that Mr. Bork was willing to stretch the Constitution in one area -LRB- free speech -RRB- while remaining rigid in all the others . </s>
<s> It achieved a good media play , and enabled Sen. Specter and others to vote against Mr. Bork out of `` conscience . '' </s>
<s> Further ammunition came from left legal theorist Ronald Dworkin , who in the New York Review of Books painted a picture of a constitutional zombie willfully reading his personal prejudices into the Constitution , particularly in the area of `` original intent . '' </s>
<s> The charge of being `` outside the mainstream '' of legal thought gravely undercut Mr. Bork 's scholarly standing , leaving him bleeding on the platform . </s>
<s> The nomination still might have been salvaged if a number of Democratic moderates in the South and Southwest had broken party lines . </s>
<s> But Democratic Sen. Bennett Johnson of Louisiana reminded the little band that anti-Bork blacks and women could furnish the margin to punish them in their next Senate elections . </s>
<s> Demographics converged with `` mainstream '' and demonizing to seal Robert Bork 's fate . </s>
<s> The upshot ? </s>
<s> Mr. Bork 's opponents chose the battlefield , held it and kept it . </s>
<s> Yet with the smooth confirmation of Anthony Kennedy , an `` 80 percenter '' only slightly less supportive of judicial restraint than Mr. Bork , the Democrats may have won the battle but lost the war . </s>
<s> Another upshot , however , was the chilling message the Bork hearings sent into the judicial culture from which the Supreme Court draws its talent . </s>
<s> The word went forth to every law school that those with federal court ambitions must travel a safe constitutional journey , with no paper trail and no bite to their tongue or pen . </s>
<s> Unfortunately , the author simply does n't supply the philosophical frame to sustain his reportorial talents . </s>
<s> He has too readily swallowed the case for the activist law school culture . </s>
<s> Probing more deeply into the doctrine of `` judicial restraint , '' he would have found a long history going back to the great decisions of Justice Holmes . </s>
<s> He would discover it also in Alexander Bickel , a subtle constitutional scholar , Mr. Bork 's closest friend at Yale , whose influence on the judge goes well beyond Mr. Bronner 's reporting . </s>
<s> Still , the long view of Robert Bork as constitutional thinker must be a spotty one . </s>
<s> His strength lies in his majoritarian doctrine , which keeps the Court clear of transient group pressures and leaves most decisions in a democracy to elected legislatures and executives . </s>
<s> Unfortunately , Mr. Bork failed to distinguish between such pressures and the emergence of great issues critical to a society that must be settled judicially if it is to cohere . </s>
<s> The question of segregated schools , in Brown vs. Board of Education , was such an issue . </s>
<s> In our time abortion has become another , best left to a line of Supreme Court decisions rather than to the chaos of 50 state legislatures . </s>
<s> A reflective and growing consensus of Americans clearly wishes to apply the right to privacy in contraceptive matters -LRB- decided in the Griswold case -RRB- to abortion as well . </s>
<s> One can understand Mr. Bork 's fear that the new right to privacy will become intolerably stretched , though a Supreme Court composed of men and women with realism , guts and a sense of limits should be able to manage it . </s>
<s> What is certain is that if Americans allow another happening like the degrading Bork confirmation circus , it will be at their peril . </s>
<s> Mr. Lerner is a writer and historian living in New York . </s>
