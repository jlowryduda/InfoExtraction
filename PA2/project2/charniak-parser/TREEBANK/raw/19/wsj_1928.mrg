<s> Sotheby 's Inc. , the world 's biggest auction house , is taking a huge Wall Street-style risk on the outcome of the sale of art from the estate of John T. Dorrance Jr. , the Campbell Soup Co. heir . </s>
<s> The Financial Services division has guaranteed the Dorrance family that it will receive a minimum of $ 100 million for the collection , regardless of what the bids for the art works total , people close to the transaction say . </s>
<s> The collection , which includes two early Picassos , a van Gogh , a Monet , other paintings , furniture and porcelains , went on sale last night in the first of six auctions . </s>
<s> What Sotheby 's is doing closely resembles an underwriting by an investment bank . </s>
<s> A corporation that wants to sell stock or bonds goes to a Wall Street firm , which purchases the securities outright , accepting the financial risk of finding buyers . </s>
<s> If the investment bank can sell the securities at a higher price than it paid the issuer , it makes a profit . </s>
<s> At the initial sale last night , for example -- the sale featuring the Impressionists masters -- bids totaled $ 116 million . </s>
<s> That was slightly above Sotheby 's presale estimate of $ 111 million . </s>
<s> Normally , Sotheby 's would have earned 20 % of the total in commissions . </s>
<s> Instead , people familiar with the transaction said , the auction house opted to forgo that percentage in order to obtain the collection and in exchange for taking a bigger chunk of proceeds exceeding $ 100 million . </s>
<s> Art dealers say that while auction houses occasionally guarantee the seller of a highly desirable work of art a minimum price , a financial commitment of this size is unprecedented . </s>
<s> Diana D. Brooks , president of Sotheby 's North America division , vehemently denies it offered the Dorrance heirs a money-back guarantee , calling such reports `` inaccurate . '' </s>
<s> Buried in the glossy hardbound catalog for the sale , however , appears the statement , `` Sotheby 's has an interest in the property in this catalog . '' </s>
<s> Explains a Sotheby 's spokeswoman , the statement `` means exactly what it says . </s>
<s> We have some level of financial interest '' in the collection . </s>
<s> `` We do n't disclose specifics . '' </s>
<s> Frank Mirabello , a lawyer for the Dorrance estate with the Philadelphia law firm of Morgan , Lewis & Bockius , declines to comment on the financial arrangements . </s>
<s> Sotheby 's made the $ 100 million guarantee to keep the Dorrance collection away from its archrival , auction house Christie 's International PLC ; Christie 's has handled smaller sales for the Dorrance family over the years . </s>
<s> When Christie 's officials asked why the firm was n't picked to sell the Dorrance collection , representatives of the Dorrance family `` told us it was a question of financial considerations , '' said Michael Findlay , Christie 's head of impressionist and modern paintings . </s>
<s> Collectors who have made their money on Wall Street have become an increasingly important part of the art business and their money has helped fuel the art boom , but recently it appears Sotheby 's has been returning the compliment . </s>
<s> In November 1987 , Sotheby 's essentially offered a Wall Street-style `` bridge loan '' of about $ 27 million to Australian businessman Alan Bond to enable him to purchase Vincent van Gogh 's `` Irises '' for $ 53.9 million . </s>
<s> It was the highest bid in history for a work of art . </s>
<s> But two weeks ago , Sotheby 's said that it has the painting under lock and key because the loan had not been fully repaid . </s>
<s> Sotheby 's is offering such deals because it 's an art sellers ' market , at least where the best works are concerned , says Ralph Lerner , an attorney and author of the book `` Art Law . '' </s>
<s> `` There seems to be a lot of art for sale , but there 's more competition . </s>
<s> The competition gives the seller the ability to cut a better deal , '' he says . </s>
<s> The Dorrance family will still receive a substantial portion of the auction proceeds above $ 100 million , people familiar with the transaction said . </s>
<s> But it 's likely that Sotheby 's will take a higher than usual commission , called an override , on the amount exceeding the guarantee . </s>
<s> Sotheby 's has been aggressively promoting the Dorrance sale . </s>
<s> At a news conference last May announcing plans for the auction , Sotheby 's estimated its value in excess of $ 100 million . </s>
<s> More recently , Sotheby 's has predicted the collection will fetch $ 140 million . </s>
<s> That 's the highest estimate for a single collection in auction history . </s>
<s> The decision to put the entire collection on the block stunned many , since Mr. Dorrance had served as chairman of the Philadelphia Museum of Art , and it had been assumed many of the works would be donated to the institution . </s>
<s> At last night 's sale , 13 of 44 works that sold were purchased by Aska International Gallery , the art-acquisition unit of Aichi Financial , a Japanese conglomerate that owns 7.5 % of Christie 's . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , Sotheby 's guarantee is raising eyebrows in the art world . </s>
<s> `` The consumer has to throw out the idea that the auction house is a disinterested middleman , '' says New York art dealer David Tunick . </s>
<s> While he adds that he has no problem with auction houses who sell works in which they have a financial interest , `` It ought not to be hidden in some small print . '' </s>
<s> In such situations , he says , the house `` is going to put the best light on things . '' </s>
<s> For example , an auction house 's comments on the condition of a work of art that is up for sale should be looked at with `` very open eyes , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` There 's more and more of this cash-up-front going on at every level , '' says Bruce Miller , president of Art Funding Corp. , an art lender . </s>
<s> Dealers and auction houses `` know if they do n't lay out a half a million for this , another one will ; it 's that competitive . '' </s>
<s> In January , two small New York galleries , the Coe Kerr Gallery and Beadleston Fine Arts , snatched a major art collection owned by the Askin family away from rival auction-house bidders with an up-front payment of about $ 25 million . </s>
<s> A Christie 's spokeswoman said that while the auction house sometimes waives its seller 's commission to attract art works -- it still gets a commission from the buyer -- Christie 's wo n't offer financial guarantees because `` Christie 's believes its primary role is as an auction house , and therefore as an agent -LCB- for buyer and seller -RCB- , not as a bank . </s>
