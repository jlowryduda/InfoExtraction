<s> Dow Chemical Co. said third-quarter net income slipped 6.8 % from a record year-ago quarter . </s>
<s> The decline broke a streak of 10 quarters in which Dow posted earnings increases . </s>
<s> Dow 's third-quarter net fell to $ 589 million , or $ 3.29 a share , from $ 632 million , or $ 3.36 a share , a year ago . </s>

<s> A spokeswoman said Dow is comfortable with Wall Street expectations that full-year earnings will total about $ 14.60 a share , compared with last year 's record net of $ 2.4 billion , or $ 12.76 a share . </s>
<s> But that signal on full-year profit casts doubt on whether Dow will improve on its year-ago fourth-quarter net of $ 3.44 a share , or $ 635 million . </s>
<s> Dow would earn $ 14.85 a share for the year if it equaled that year-ago fourth-quarter performance . </s>
<s> Dow officials were signaling that the company would earn less than $ 15 a share this year even before they announced in July a plan to acquire 67 % of Marion Laboratories Inc . </s>
<s> That acquisition could further dilute earnings per share this year , the company spokeswoman said . </s>
<s> Dow has n't said exactly what impact the Marion acquisition will have on 1989 earnings . </s>
<s> Dow blamed the third-quarter earnings drop on several factors , including softer prices for polyethylene and other basic chemicals , a slower U.S. economy and a stronger dollar , which made Dow 's exports from the U.S. more expensive to overseas customers . </s>
<s> Another problem was a 7 % increase in operating costs at a time when revenue was rising by only 2 % . </s>
<s> For the first nine months of the year , Dow earned $ 2.06 billion , or $ 11.41 a share , up 17 % from $ 1.76 billion , or $ 9.32 a share , a year ago . </s>
