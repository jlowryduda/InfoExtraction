<s> The White House is making sure nobody will accuse it of taking this crisis lightly . </s>
<s> In the aftermath of the California earthquake , President Bush and his aides flew into a whirlwind of earthquake-related activity yesterday morning . </s>
<s> Some of it was necessary to get federal help flowing to victims , but some seemed designed mostly to project an image of a White House in action . </s>
<s> Mr. Bush and his aides were accused of responding too slowly after the Exxon Valdez oil tanker split open in Alaskan waters and Hurricane Hugo struck the Carolina coast , and they clearly do n't want a repeat of those charges now . </s>
<s> So the White House announced that Mr. Bush got his first earthquake briefing of the day at 6:30 a.m. from chief of staff John Sununu . </s>
<s> By noon , Mr. Bush had taken two phone calls from Vice President Dan Quayle , who was in California ; made a televised statement of concern ; signed a disaster proclamation ; received a written report from the Federal Emergency Management Agency ; and visited FEMA headquarters . </s>
<s> Mr. Bush himself essentially acknowledged that he and his aides were trying to head off criticism . </s>
<s> On his FEMA visit , Mr. Bush said that he hoped there would be `` less carping '' about the emergency office 's performance this time , adding that the agency `` took a hit '' for its reaction to Hurricane Hugo . </s>
<s> The White House already is talking of Mr. Bush visiting the California earthquake site this weekend . </s>
<s> He visited the Hugo devastation but not until after local leaders urged him to do so . </s>
