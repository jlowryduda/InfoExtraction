<s> Dale Lang , who this week completed the acquisition of the publisher of Ms. and Sassy , is candid about the challenge he is taking on . </s>
<s> Mr. Lang admits that Ms. is `` in dire straits '' and that Sassy needs big promotional dollars to keep it alive . </s>
<s> But the 57-year-old publisher has moved quickly and boldly to deal with the magazines ' problems . </s>
<s> Last Friday , he told the staff of Ms. that the magazine in January would begin publishing without advertising . </s>
<s> Mr. Lang will do away with expensive circulation drives , not to mention sales staff , and attempt to publish the 17-year-old magazine supported by circulation revenue alone . </s>
<s> `` Any fool can publish a money-losing magazine . </s>
<s> I want to publish one that succeeds , '' said Mr. Lang . </s>
<s> `` For Ms. , it 's time to publish for the reader , not the advertiser . '' </s>
<s> As for Sassy , which competes directly with News Corp. 's Seventeen magazine , Mr. Lang says that in the next two years he will spend $ 6 million promoting and improving the magazine . </s>
<s> Though Sassy has grown quickly since its debut in March 1988 , it has been the target of conservative lobbyists and skittish advertisers who bristled at its frank editorial matter on teen-age problems . </s>
<s> Mr. Lang said the former Australian owners of Sassy were `` blind-sided by the Moral Majority ... . </s>
<s> Their reaction was to do nothing and ride it out . '' </s>
<s> He said Sassy will keep its irreverent tone , but added , `` We will keep a close watch on the editorial content of the magazine . '' </s>
<s> Sassy already has recovered ; circulation has quickly passed the 500,000 mark and advertising pages have stabilized this year at more than 300 . </s>
<s> What 's more , Mr. Lang says he has what all publishers wish for : a bona fide niche . </s>
<s> `` Seventeen is written more for mothers , not their daughters , '' said Mr. Lang . </s>
<s> `` But Sassy has a different spirit . </s>
<s> It gets more mail in a month than McCall 's got in a year , and it 's not from mothers . </s>
<s> I feel about Sassy like I did about Working Woman 10 years ago . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Lang took on Ms. and Sassy with the acquisition of Matilda Publications Inc. by his newly formed Lang Communications . </s>
<s> Lang owns 70 % of Matilda , while Citicorp owns the rest through its Citicorp Venture Capital Partners . </s>
<s> Two weeks ago , Citicorp and Mr. Lang pumped $ 800,000 into Matilda just to keep the doors open . </s>
<s> Industry observers have congratulated Mr. Lang on what some call his `` courageous '' handling of Ms. , but his track record in magazine publishing in general has gotten mixed reviews . </s>
<s> Besides Ms. and Sassy , closely held Lang Communications includes Success , a magazine for entrepreneurs and small businesses , and Working Woman and Working Mother , two monthly magazines . </s>
<s> Working Woman , with circulation near one million , and Working Mother , with 625,000 circulation , are legitimate magazine success stories . </s>
<s> The magazine Success , however , was for years lackluster and unfocused . </s>
<s> Only recently has it been attractively redesigned and its editorial product improved . </s>
<s> Success is expected to gain at least because of the recent folding of rival Venture , another magazine for growing companies . </s>
<s> Working Woman and Working Mother have operated as part of Working Woman\/McCall 's Group , a less-than-successful joint venture between Mr. Lang and Time Warner Inc . </s>
<s> The joint venture is being undone , with McCall 's magazine being sold last summer to the New York Times Co. 's Magazine Group for about $ 80 million , and Time Warner agreeing to sell back its 50 % interest in Working Woman and Working Mother to Mr. Lang . </s>
<s> Executives at Time Inc . Magazine Co. , a subsidiary of Time Warner , have said the joint venture with Mr. Lang was n't a good one . </s>
<s> The venture , formed in 1986 , was supposed to be Time 's low-cost , safe entry into women 's magazines . </s>
<s> Mr. Lang surprised Time soon after joining forces when he said he would negotiate rates individually with advertisers , a practice common in broadcasting but considered taboo by magazine publishers . </s>
<s> In addition , McCall 's put in a less than stellar performance . </s>
<s> Until a recent comeback , it saw steep losses in ad pages and circulation . </s>
<s> Time executives complained about the shoddy editorial quality , and in the end , one Time executive who asked not to be identified said , `` Frankly , McCall 's and the joint venture were an embarrassment . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Lang feels that Time 's priorities changed . </s>
<s> `` Their management changed right after -LCB- the venture was formed -RCB- , and I do n't think they were comfortable getting into the competitive wars of women 's service magazines . '' </s>
<s> Today , Mr. Lang believes his magazines will offer what many women 's magazines do n't . </s>
<s> `` We write straight for women on their level , '' he said . </s>
<s> `` We do n't have passive readers . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Lang points out that even Success , in part , fits the company 's image , since about 30 % of its readership is female . </s>
<s> Mr. Lang has named Carol Taber , 43 , as group publisher of New York-based Lang Communications . </s>
<s> She will oversee Working Woman , Working Mother and Success magazines , and retain her post as publisher of Working Woman . </s>
<s> The sale price of McCall 's -- twice what Mr. Lang originally paid for it -- will finance Lang Communications ' buy-back of Time Warner 's 50 % interest in Working Woman and Working Mother . </s>
<s> Mr. Lang says he is n't scouting new acquisitions , at least for now . </s>
<s> `` We would have to go outside to banks to get the money and I am not ready to do that , '' he said . </s>
<s> `` Besides , we have enough on our plate . </s>
<s> There is plenty of work to be done on what we have . </s>
