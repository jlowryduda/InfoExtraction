<s> Within minutes after the stock market closed Friday , I called Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey , advised him that the Dow Jones Industrial Average had declined by 190 points late that afternoon , and cheerfully informed him that he and his fellow Democrats were to blame . </s>
<s> They had dealt a major setback that afternoon to President Bush 's capital-gains tax cut proposal , which had seemed in the bag after it passed the House overwhelmingly earlier in the month . </s>
<s> Sen. Bradley has it in his mind that such a tax cut would unravel the tax reform he helped engineer in 1986 . </s>
<s> But he knows that as many as 20 of his fellow Democrats are disposed to vote for the cut , popular among their constituents . </s>
<s> As a result , he took the lead in arguing that the cut should be blocked on procedural grounds . </s>
<s> He helped persuade 10 of these senators to support him and Majority Leader George Mitchell on these grounds . </s>
<s> The budget reconciliation had to be dealt with by the Oct. 15 deadline , and these Senate Democrats refused to agree to allow a vote to append capital gains to the budget bill , knowing it would pass . </s>
<s> Denied a vote on substance , the GOP leadership in the Senate on Friday morning was confronted with a hard choice . </s>
<s> It could throw in the towel and hope to win on capital gains late this month , or it could follow the White House strategy , to veto reconciliation unless capital gains was appended . </s>
<s> The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has been in the forefront in supporting the Bush proposal . </s>
<s> It endorsed the White House strategy , believing it to be the surest way to victory . </s>
<s> At noon Friday , a senior White House official advised Richard Rahn , the Chamber 's chief economist , that the White House would not agree to a budget reconciliation bill unless it had firm assurances that a vote on substance would be permitted in the Senate . </s>
<s> Two hours later , the first word emerged on Capitol Hill that the administration had agreed to reconciliation with no such assurances from Senate Democrats . </s>
<s> Mr. Rahn was shocked , telephoning the office of Richard Darman , director of the Office of Management and Budget , and the administration 's chief strategist on this issue . </s>
<s> He left a message accusing Mr. Darman of selling out . </s>
<s> It was the Senate Republicans , though , who had edged away from the veto strategy . </s>
<s> The stock market reacted as Mr. Rahn did , crumbling as it absorbed the news that Mr. Darman 's strategy had been abandoned . </s>
<s> The stock market , after all , represents the collective expectations about the value of the future income stream of the nation 's capital stock , discounted to present value . </s>
<s> Why should it be so surprising that a 30 % cut in the capital-gains tax would have such an enormous impact on the value of the nation 's capital stock ? </s>
<s> The total value of privately held assets is easily more than $ 15 trillion . </s>
<s> The value traded on the exchanges is close to $ 3 trillion . </s>
<s> If the tax on any gain to those assets was doubled , would n't the value fall to the owners of the assets ? </s>
<s> Is n't it reasonable to assume that the asset you own would be worth more if the government suddenly announced that if you sold it , you would be able to keep 30 % more of its gain than you previously believed ? </s>
<s> Indeed , the stock market 's steady advance this year tracked with President Bush 's success in advancing his capital-gains proposal . </s>
<s> A 30 % cut in this year 's capital gains alone amounts to roughly $ 50 billion . </s>
<s> We 're talking real money . </s>
<s> When Richard Rahn advised the financial press that the market crash was caused by the setback to capital gains , he was generally ignored and mildly ridiculed . </s>
<s> Instead , the press corps readily accepted the notion that a snag in the takeover financing of United Airlines instantly knocked 7 % off the value of the nation 's capital stock and caused convulsions around the world . </s>
<s> Mr. Rahn was pointing out an elephant rumbling through Wall Street while conventional wisdom had fastened on the UAL flea . </s>
<s> Why is this happening ? </s>
<s> For one thing , quite a number of the leading spokesmen on Wall Street are not portfolio managers , who understand that the value of assets is greatly affected by how government taxes those assets . </s>
<s> They are economists and financial reporters who sympathize with the view that a capital-gains tax cut benefits the rich . </s>
<s> Yet they somehow think that Wall Street is indifferent to losing the tax cut that seemed so close Friday morning and is now problematic . </s>
<s> The market rebound Monday followed weekend assurances from Mr. Darman that the administration has other plans to win the cut , which is alive and well . </s>
<s> Sen. Bradley 's argument is that a capital-gains tax cut would be bad for the economy in the longer run . </s>
<s> It would inevitably lead to an increase in marginal income-tax rates in 1990 , he thinks , when the White House is forced to ask for higher taxes to meet budget targets . </s>
<s> That is , with capital gains cut , the glue of the 1986 accord will be gone , and political realities will push up income-tax rates . </s>
<s> The counter-argument , which he has heard , is that if he and his fellow Democrats are successful in killing the president 's proposal , the revenue gap will open up tremendously in 1990 because of the weakened economy . </s>
<s> In this atmosphere , there would be no serious consideration of tax increases . </s>
<s> If Sen. Bradley would permit a vote on capital gains , though , it would pass , Christmas retail sales would be strong instead of burdened by a falling stock market , the 1990 economy would be robust , and the revenue gains at every level of government , including New Jersey 's , would be surprisingly high . </s>
<s> No tax increases would be necessary . </s>
<s> The struggle over capital gains is the most important game in town . </s>
<s> In Washington and on Wall Street . </s>
