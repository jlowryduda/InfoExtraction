<s> In one of the first indoor air-pollution cases to go to trial , a state-court jury decided in favor of the defendant , Burlington Industries Inc . </s>
<s> The verdict , reached late last week in Cincinnati , may end an eight-year legal battle for the Greensboro , N.C. , carpet maker . </s>
<s> Glenn and Sharon Beebe of Cincinnati had sued the com - pany in 1981 after installing Burlington carpets in their office . </s>
<s> The Beebes alleged that toxic fumes from the carpets made them sick . </s>
<s> As a result of their illness , the Beebes said , they lost $ 1.8 million in wages and earnings . </s>
<s> In addition , they said that months of exposure to the chemicals has left them sensitive to a wide range of commonly used substances . </s>
<s> The case had been closely watched because attorneys anticipate increasing litigation nationally over the so-called sick-building syndrome . </s>
<s> Plaintiffs ' lawyers say that buildings become `` sick '' when inadequate fresh air and poor ventilation systems lead pollutants to build up inside . </s>
<s> Anthony J. Iaciofano , a lawyer for Burlington , said the company believes the Beebes ' symptoms were not related to the carpeting . </s>
<s> He said that ill effects from new carpets manifest themselves immediately but that the Beebes ' symptoms appeared months later . </s>
<s> Catherine Adams , the Beebes ' lawyer , said the verdict would not discourage other plaintiffs from filing such suits . </s>
<s> Scientists are only beginning to understand what causes sick-building syndrome and much of that research was unavailable when the Beebes filed the case , she said . </s>
<s> The Beebes now believe that a prime culprit for their injuries was fumes from an adhesive used in the carpeting . </s>
<s> But the Beebes did n't come to that conclusion until time limits had elapsed for adding the adhesives maker as a defendant in the case , Ms. Adams said . </s>
<s> The Beebes have not yet decided whether to appeal . </s>
<s> TIMES SQUARE development opponents are dealt setback . </s>
<s> The Appellate Division of New York State Supreme Court dismissed six lawsuits attempting to block a $ 2.5 billion project planned for 42nd Street in Manhattan . </s>
<s> Opponents of the project had claimed that the city and the state of New York , which are co-sponsoring the project , had failed to adhere to environmental guidelines . </s>
<s> All but two of the 40 or so lawsuits that have been filed since the project 's 1984 approval have been dismissed before the trial stage . </s>
<s> The two that remain have n't yet reached the pre-trial fact-finding stage . </s>
<s> State officials said the court 's ruling clears the way for proceedings to condemn buildings in the area . </s>
<s> `` This project is ready to move , '' said State Urban Development Corp. Chairman Vincent Tese . </s>
<s> But developers of four planned office towers cautioned that obstacles still remain . </s>
<s> As part of the agreement with the state , the developers -- a partnership of Park Tower Realty and Prudential Insurance Co. of America -- said they would not proceed with condemnation proceedings while there was `` significant litigation '' pending . </s>
<s> Park Tower General Counsel Matthew Mayer said the development team will have to review two additional lawsuits before putting up a $ 155 million letter of credit to cover condemnation costs . </s>
<s> Also , he said , the partnership is waiting to see whether the appellate division 's ruling will be appealed . </s>
<s> The plan , which has been plagued with delays and business-related setbacks , seeks to transform the area from a seedy thoroughfare to a more wholesome office and theater district . </s>
<s> State and city officials are still negotiating with developers to renovate historic theaters and build and operate a merchandise mart and hotel . </s>
<s> FEDERAL JUDGE EXPANDS role of U.S. courts in extradition decisions . </s>
<s> U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein of Brooklyn , N.Y. , ruled that a man implicated in an attack on an Israeli passenger bus in 1986 can be extradited to Israel for trial . </s>
<s> A magistrate had initially refused the request , ruling that the attack had been a political act for which the man , Mahmoud El-Abed Ahmad , would be exempt from extradition . </s>
<s> However , Judge Weinstein wrote in his opinion late last month that terrorism and acts of war against civilians can not be defined as political acts . </s>
<s> Judge Weinstein also ruled that judges must consider prior to extradition whether the defendant will be treated fairly in a foreign court . </s>
<s> To do so , the judge said , the U.S. courts must review the judicial process in the foreign country independently of the State Department 's assessment . </s>
<s> He said that in this case he concurred with the State Department 's decision that Mr. Ahmad should be extradited . </s>
<s> Mr. Ahmad 's lawyer said he would appeal . </s>
<s> Lawyers close to the case said they believed the ruling was unprecedented . </s>
<s> `` Up until now the courts have said it is not their role to supervise the foreign country 's courts , '' said Jacques Semmelman , the assistant U.S. attorney on the case . </s>
<s> FORMER CANADIAN AMBASSADOR to the U.S. Allan E. Gotlieb has joined the Philadelphia law firm of Pepper , Hamilton & Scheetz as a consultant . </s>
<s> Mr. Gotlieb , who serves as a consultant to Stikeman , Elliott , one of Canada 's biggest law firms , is advising Pepper Hamilton 's Washington office on legal matters related to Canadian-U.S. investment , corporate finance and international transactions . </s>
<s> QUOTABLE : </s>
<s> In a speech prepared for delivery in New York yesterday , retired Justice Lewis Powell contested the notion that the last Supreme Court term marked a turn toward conservatism : `` Commentators who agreed on little else unanimously proclaimed a ` shift in direction ' on the court ... . </s>
<s> I take these pronouncements , like many that have preceded them in past years , with a grain of salt . </s>
<s> In an era of ` sound bites ' and instant opinion polls it is dangerous to apply broad labels to a single term . </s>
