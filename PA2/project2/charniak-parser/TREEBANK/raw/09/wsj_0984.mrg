<s> One of the more bizarre garden stories since Eden has been unfolding for four years now , in the private paper-and-crayon fantasies of artist Jennifer Bartlett . </s>
<s> And if she and the Battery Park City Authority have their way , her horticulturally inept plan will soon go public as a real garden `` artwork '' in the downtown complex . </s>
<s> South Gardens , as the Bartlett scheme is called , will occupy the last 3.5 acres of open space at the southwest tip of Manhattan . </s>
<s> It could cost taxpayers $ 15 million to install and BPC residents $ 1 million a year to maintain . </s>
<s> Created by an artist who flaunts her ignorance of plants and gardens , South Gardens , as now planned , will die from congestive garden design . </s>
<s> Ms. Bartlett 's previous work , which earned her an international reputation in the non-horticultural art world , often took gardens as its nominal subject . </s>
<s> Mayhap this metaphorical connection made the BPC Fine Arts Committee think she had a literal green thumb . </s>
<s> -LRB- Ms. Bartlett would not discuss her garden for this article . -RRB- </s>
<s> Last year she boasted to HG magazine : `` I 'd never looked at a garden in my life . '' </s>
<s> And she proved no shirking violet in her initial statement to the BPCA , a New York State public benefit corporation : `` The only thing I was interested in doing was a very complicated garden , which would cost an enormous amount of money and be very expensive to maintain . '' </s>
<s> Undeterred , the BPCA hired Ms. Bartlett and another confessed garden ignoramus , the architect Alexander Cooper , who claimed he had never visited , much less built , a garden , and said of the project , `` I do n't view this as a landscape . </s>
<s> I view this as a building . '' </s>
<s> The third principal in the South Gardens adventure did have garden experience . </s>
<s> The firm of Bruce Kelly\/David Varnell Landscape Architects had created Central Park 's Strawberry Fields and Shakespeare Garden . </s>
<s> The BPCA called its team a `` stunning '' collaboration . </s>
<s> After four years , though , the South Gardens design is 100 % uncollaborated Jennifer Bartlett . </s>
<s> She has done little more than recycle her standard motifs -- trees , water , landscape fragments , rudimentary square houses , circles , triangles , rectangles -- and fit them into a grid , as if she were making one of her gridded two-dimensional works for a gallery wall . </s>
<s> But for South Gardens , the grid was to be a 3-D network of masonry or hedge walls with real plants inside them . </s>
<s> In a letter to the BPCA , kelly\/varnell called this `` arbitrary and amateurish . '' </s>
<s> The landscape architects were expelled from the garden in July . </s>
<s> All the while , Ms. Bartlett had been busy at her assignment , serene in her sense of self-tilth . </s>
<s> As she put it in a 1987 lecture at the Harvard Graduate School of Design : `` I have designed a garden , not knowing the difference between a rhododendron and a tulip . '' </s>
<s> Moreover , she proclaimed that `` landscape architects have been going wrong for the last 20 years '' in the design of open space . </s>
<s> And she further stunned her listeners by revealing her secret garden design method : Commissioning a friend to spend `` five or six thousand dollars ... on books that I ultimately cut up . '' </s>
<s> After that , the layout had been easy . </s>
<s> `` I 've always relied heavily on the grid and found it never to fail . '' </s>
<s> Ms. Bartlett told her audience that she absolutely did not believe in compromise or in giving in to the client `` because I do n't think you can do watered-down versions of things . '' </s>
<s> -LRB- This was never a problem with South Gardens , because the client had long since given in to Ms. Bartlett 's every whim . -RRB- </s>
<s> Last year the public was afforded a preview of Ms. Bartlett 's creation in a tablemodel version , at a BPC exhibition . </s>
<s> The labels were breathy : `` Within its sheltering walls is a microcosm of a thousand years in garden design ... a rose garden , herb garden , serpentine garden , flower fields , an apple orchard ... organized in a patchwork of 50-by-50-foot squares to form ` rooms ' ... here and there are simple architectural forms , a whimsical jet of water , a conceit of topiary or tartan plaid , and chairs of every sort to drag around ... . </s>
<s> At the core of it all is a love for plants . '' </s>
<s> Plant lovers who studied the maquette were alarmed . </s>
<s> They looked at the miniature and saw a giant folly . </s>
<s> Ms. Bartlett 's little rooms left little room for plants or people . </s>
<s> Kelly\/Varnell had put South Gardens ' carrying capacity at four people per room , or about 100 humans overall . </s>
<s> This mincemeat of tiny gridlocked squares was inspired by the artist 's own digs : `` My loft was 50 by 100 feet , so 50 feet by 50 feet seemed like a good garden room . '' </s>
<s> Inside the grid were 24 of these plant cells jammed full of clutter . </s>
<s> One she made into a topiary rec room , replete with plants shaped into a Barcalounger , TV , piano and chairs . </s>
<s> In another , she requisitioned topiary MX missile cones -- costing $ 10,000 each -- in heights up to 20 feet . </s>
<s> Another she stuffed with eight `` rectilinear hedges '' for a topiary geometry lesson in the right-angling of plants . </s>
<s> In the herbal lounge she specified a `` plaid knot garden '' decor . </s>
<s> She ordered the foyer done in a different plaid planting , and made the landscape architects study a book on tartans . </s>
<s> In one garden roomette she implanted a 43-foot square glass cube meant to show off a plaid tile floor conceit , a `` zinc sink , '' a `` huge fishbowl with carp '' and a `` birdcage with cockatoos . '' </s>
<s> Next door she put a smaller plaid-floored glass house , where , she suggested , a flat of strawberries might be displayed in the dead of winter . </s>
<s> In another compartment called the Linden Bosque , 62 linden trees were to be crowded together at killing intervals of 10 or 16 feet . </s>
<s> -LRB- Lindens need about 36 feet . -RRB- </s>
<s> One thing about the Bartlett plan was never in doubt : It would demand the full-time skills of a battalion of topiary barbers , rosarians , orchardists and arborists . </s>
<s> Ms. Bartlett blithely suggested calling upon `` semi-skilled garden club workers for maintenance . '' </s>
<s> Furthermore , she had insisted on paths so narrow -LRB- five to eight feet -RRB- and hedge corners so square that standard maintenance equipment -- trucks or cherry pickers -- could n't maneuver . </s>
<s> Then , to make these gardenettes quite literally rooms , Ms. Bartlett had thrown up windowless walls -LRB- brick , lattice , hedge -RRB- eight to 10 feet tall , casting her interiors into day-long Stygian shade . </s>
<s> It was hard to see how photosynthesis would ever happen in South Gardens without decking the walls in a Christmas-like array of Gro-Lites . </s>
<s> Finally , flouting the BPCA 's wishes to continue the popular two-mile riverside Esplanade , prized for its expansive views of New York Harbor , the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island , Ms. Bartlett threw up yet another wall , this time concrete , this time 10 1\/2 feet tall . </s>
<s> She ran it the length of the South Gardens riverfront , blotting out the city 's great natural water features , the harbor and the river . </s>
<s> -LRB- Within her garden , she has decreed a waterfall , a rill , ponds and other costly , trivial waterworks beside the Hudson . -RRB- </s>
<s> While the model was still on view , Manhattan Community Board 1 passed a resolution against South Gardens . </s>
<s> The Parks Council wrote the BPCA that this `` too ` private ' ... exclusive , '' complex and expensive `` enclosed garden ... belongs in almost any location but the waterfront . '' </s>
<s> Lynden B. Miller , the noted public garden designer who restored Central Park 's Conservatory Garden , recalls her reaction to the South Gardens model in light of the public garden she was designing for 42nd Street 's Bryant Park : `` Bryant Park , as designed in 1933 , failed as a public space , because it made people feel trapped . </s>
<s> By removing the hedges and some walls , the Bryant Park Restoration is opening it up . </s>
<s> It seems to me the BPCA plan has the potential of making South Gardens a horticultural jail for people and plants . '' </s>
<s> The three urban horticulture experts with Cornell Cooperative Extension weighed in with a letter to the BPCA that began : `` We feel that the garden is horticulturally doomed . '' </s>
<s> They then addressed the decidedly `` questionable safety of ... a complex garden of endless hiding places . </s>
<s> The 8 ft. hedges which obstruct views in and out of small ` rooms ' insure ... that this garden will be a potential breeding ground for crime . '' </s>
<s> -LRB- At Harvard , Ms. Bartlett had declared : `` There are going to be problems with safety ... </s>
<s> I 'm not going to address questions of safety ! '' -RRB- </s>
<s> Despite the dire assessments of knowledgeable garden professionals , Ms. Bartlett 's South Gardens design somehow continues on , seemingly impervious to reason , stalled only by bureaucratic lethargy and logistical complications . </s>
<s> BPCA President and CEO David Emil hopes to negotiate a seawall that could `` be significantly more visually permeable . '' </s>
<s> And by substituting yet another landscape architect , Nicholas Quennell , he insists he can achieve that and other accommodations to gardening reality while still preserving the `` artistic vision '' of a `` truly great artist . '' </s>
<s> After four years of no progress in this direction , it is doubtful any viable collaboration with Ms. Bartlett will suddenly now be possible . </s>
<s> -LRB- Mr. Quennell has said he plans to go with the grid , regardless . -RRB- </s>
<s> There is still time , however , for Gov. Mario Cuomo or Fabian Palomino , chairman of the BPCA board , to prevent this topiary `` Tilted Arc . '' </s>
<s> These statesmen might take counsel from William Robinson , author of `` The English Flower Garden '' -- the gardener 's bible since 1883 -- who seems to have had a Jennifer Bartlett in mind when he wrote : `` Unhappily , our gardeners for ages have suffered at the hands of the decorative artist when applying his ` designs ' to the garden ... . </s>
<s> It is this adapting of absurd ` knots ' and patterns from old books to any surface where a flower garden has to be made that leads to bad and frivolous design -- wrong in plan and hopeless for the life of plants . </s>
