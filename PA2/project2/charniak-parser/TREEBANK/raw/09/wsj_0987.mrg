<s> Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Richard Breeden told a congressional subcommittee that he would consider imposing `` circuit breakers '' to halt program trading at volatile times . </s>
<s> Mr. Breeden , in his first testimony to Congress since taking the SEC post , said the agency is studying the Friday the 13th market plunge , including how current circuit breakers affected the market that day and the following Monday . </s>
<s> After the study , the SEC would be willing to consider adding new circuit breakers or fine-tuning the current ones , he added . </s>
<s> Circuit breakers , designed to give the markets a breather in cases of sharp price movements , curb trading of futures or stocks at various trigger points . </s>
<s> At certain points during the Friday the 13th drop , circuit breakers kicked in on the futures market , slowing trading at times . </s>
<s> A circuit breaker that would have closed down the New York Stock Exchange was n't tripped . </s>
<s> Rep. Edward Markey -LRB- D. , Mass. -RRB- , chairman of the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee , is pushing the idea of a circuit breaker for computer-driven program trading in hopes that would curb `` turmoil '' in the marketplace . </s>
<s> He argued that program-trading by roughly 15 big institutions is pushing around the markets and scaring individual investors . </s>
<s> Mr. Breeden did n't reject the proposal . </s>
<s> After the SEC study of the drop is completed , he said , `` I 'm perfectly happy to work with this committee ... in identifying whether we need other devices , '' such as a program-trading curb . </s>
<s> Mr. Breeden backed most of the provisions in a market-reform bill that the SEC brought to the subcommittee last year under then-chairman David Ruder . </s>
<s> The measure is expected to move through this Congress . </s>
<s> But the new chairman vehemently opposed a provision in the bill that would give the agency the right to close the markets at times of stress . </s>
<s> Mr. Breeden contended that uncertainty over when the SEC might act could worsen volatility in the markets . </s>
<s> He argued that the current circuit-breaker system allows investors to know `` precisely when and where any trading interruptions will occur and how long they will last . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Breeden offered strong support for two other provisions in the bill . </s>
<s> One would force brokerage houses to provide the SEC detailed information about loans made by their holding companies . </s>
<s> Such loans often are used to finance leveraged buy-outs , and the agency is worried that a sharp market drop could create capital problems for the firms . </s>
<s> He also backed a rule to require large traders to report transactions on a systematic basis . </s>
<s> That information , he argued , is critical to reconstructing sharp market moves , such as the one nearly two weeks ago . </s>
