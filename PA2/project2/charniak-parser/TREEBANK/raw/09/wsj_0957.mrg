<s> Regarding your Sept. 28 Politics & Policy column on the party differences over cutting capital gains or expanding IRAs : Why not compromise now and save the public from the coming infantile congressional political rhetoric that seems to go hand in hand with the process ? </s>

<s> It 's ridiculous for a family with taxable income of $ 50,000 to pay the same 28 % incremental tax rate as a family with taxable income of $ 250,000 . </s>
<s> The 33 % bracket should apply to all income over the applicable level , not just the 5 % rate adjustment amount . </s>
<s> It 's equally ridiculous not to provide a capital investment or retirement-savings tax incentive . </s>
