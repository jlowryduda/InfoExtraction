<s> Brooks Armored Car Service Inc. never wanted to get into money laundering . </s>
<s> But July 5 , a thunderstorm in Wilmington , Del. , caused Shellpot Creek to rise 15 feet , pouring 1.3 million gallons of water into basement vaults . </s>
<s> The water destroyed about $ 75 million in currency and caked $ 4 million of coins with mud , rendering them dangerous to counting machines . </s>
<s> The $ 75 million in paper money , although moldy , mildewy and smelly , was exchanged through the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia without incident . </s>
<s> But Brooks was unable to reach a coin-cleaning agreement with the government . </s>
<s> `` We kind of got caught between bureaucracies , '' says President William F. Brooks Jr . </s>
<s> The U.S. Mint would n't take the coin because it was n't mutilated , and the Federal Reserve Bank accepts only clean coins , he says . </s>
<s> The Philadelphia Fed says it is merely an `` agent '' for coins , responsible only for storage and distribution . </s>
<s> `` We issue paper money ; we destroy paper money , '' says Jane Hinkle , a Philadelphia Fed spokeswoman . </s>
<s> `` The coin is their problem . '' </s>
<s> A Mint official says the agency offered to clean the coins for its `` bare-bones '' cost of $ 17,000 plus certain other expenses . </s>
<s> But Brooks declined , figuring that transporting the mucked up money to Washington would cost the company thousands more . </s>
<s> So Brooks gave the dirty work to Coin Wrap Inc. , which came up with an unusual solution . </s>
<s> For eight hours a day for the past two weeks , in aggregates of as much as 27,000 pounds -LRB- equaling $ 20,000 in pennies -RRB- , Coin Wrap has been pouring money into a cement-mixing truck . </s>
<s> A giant heater , working like a blowtorch , causes the mud to crust and burns off any wrappers . </s>
<s> After clanging around for an hour or so , the shiny , hot money pours out of the cement chute , where a giant vacuum sucks away the dried mud and burnt wrappers . </s>
<s> After cooling , the coins are then rewrapped . </s>
<s> Brooks expects to pay Coin Wrap a total of about $ 20,000 -- a cost that insurance wo n't cover . </s>
<s> And while the job is half done , Brooks is still bitter . </s>
<s> In fact , there 's only one person involved who 's happy , and that 's Floyd String , president of Coin Wrap and conceiver of the cement-truck solution . </s>
<s> Not only did his company find $ 20,000 worth of work , but when the approach was suggested , Mr. String says , Brooks officials `` did n't laugh at me or anything . </s>
