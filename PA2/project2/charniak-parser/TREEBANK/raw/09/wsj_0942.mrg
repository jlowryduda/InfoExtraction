<s> Some of America 's biggest trading partners gave a quick thumbs-down to a U.S. proposal to liberalize world trade and reduce farm-product subsidies . </s>
<s> In Geneva , where world trade talks are being held under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , or GATT , the European Community called the U.S. proposal `` a step backward . '' </s>
<s> And Japan 's minister of agriculture , forestry and fisheries told a committee of Japan 's parliament that Washington 's proposal was impractical and that Tokyo would continue to heavily subsidize its rice farmers . </s>
<s> The U.S. , in a far-reaching plan submitted to the Geneva meeting Tuesday , proposed curbing price support subsidies within 10 years and eliminating export subsidies within five years . </s>
<s> U.S. officials said the plan was flexible , and was intended as a pragmatic approach for gradually removing trade-distorting subsidies . </s>
<s> But the EC reacted defiantly , arguing that the proposal 's main aim is to destroy the Common Agricultural Policy , the EC 's $ 28 billion-a-year price support program . </s>
<s> `` The American proposal is not an adequate basis for negotiation , '' the EC said in a statement . </s>
<s> EC officials say they are irked that the U.S. has set a specific timetable and is insisting on the `` elimination '' of export subsides , not just reduction . </s>
<s> EC Agriculture Commissioner Ray MacSharry said the U.S. plan `` calls into question '' the agreement reached by world negotiators last April in Geneva seeking `` substantial progressive reductions in agricultural support and protection . '' </s>
<s> U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Jules Katz replied that the proposal was entirely consistent with the April accord . </s>
<s> He said he was surprised by the EC 's reaction , calling it `` vehement , even frenetic . '' </s>
<s> The U.S. proposal also was criticized by food-importing developing countries , who said that the U.S. made no special allowances for poor nations . </s>
<s> While many experts argue that food-importing nations would eventually become self-sufficient in a free-market system , the poorest nations are likely to need help in the meantime . </s>
<s> Ambassador Katz said the U.S. was open to discussing particular problems of developing countries . </s>
<s> The U.S. administration said its plan would allow considerable flexibility in determining how and when the free-trade goals would be achieved . </s>
<s> The U.S. argues that its plan would ease the transition to freer agriculture trade by converting certain non-tariff barriers into tariffs that , together with existing tariffs , then would be phased out over 10 years . </s>
<s> But the EC is strongly opposed to converting agricultural supports into tariffs . </s>
<s> The new U.S. package also says countries could temporarily raise tariffs on certain products if they experience an unusually heavy volume of imports . </s>
<s> It would establish procedures to prevent countries from using health and sanitation rules to impede trade arbitrarily . </s>
<s> Seeking to allay European concerns , U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said in Washington that the new U.S. plan would n't `` put farmers out of business '' but would encourage them to `` grow what the markets desire instead of what the government wants . '' </s>
<s> The EC , with a population of 320 million , has 8.5 million farmers , while the U.S. , with a population of about 245 million , has only two million farmers . </s>
<s> Japan 's objections to the U.S. plan center around its desire to stay self-sufficient in rice , a staple food , even though foreign producers are far more efficient . </s>
