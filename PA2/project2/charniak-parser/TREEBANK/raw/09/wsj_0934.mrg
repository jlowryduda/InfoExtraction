<s> The Soviet State Bank announced a 90 % devaluation of the ruble against the dollar for private transactions , in an apparent attempt to curb the nation 's rapidly growing black market for hard currency . </s>
<s> The measure , which will take effect next Wednesday , will create a two-tier exchange rate . </s>
<s> Commercial transactions will continue to be based on the official rate of about 0.63 rubles to the dollar . </s>
<s> But for Soviet citizens who travel abroad for business or tourism , the rate will jump to 6.26 rubles to the dollar . </s>
<s> Tass news agency said the devaluation also will apply to foreigners ' transactions . </s>
<s> But it did n't elaborate , and it remains unclear how far Western tourists and foreigners living in Moscow will be allowed to benefit from the sweeping rate cut . </s>
<s> The current ruble rate has long been out of line with the black market . </s>
<s> As Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has opened up the country to foreign trade , the discrepancy has become ever greater . </s>
<s> Western tourists in the Soviet Union who could exchange a dollar -- albeit illegally -- for about four rubles a year ago are now being offered 15 rubles or more . </s>
<s> Even at such rates , black marketeers have been able to make big profits because of the dire shortage of consumer goods here . </s>
<s> They use dollars to buy Western items such as video recorders and personal computers and then sell them at a huge mark-up . </s>
<s> The going rate for a small personal computer that costs about $ 2,000 in the West is anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000 rubles . </s>
<s> Even a pack of 20 Western cigarettes can fetch 20 rubles or more . </s>
<s> With more than 300 billion rubles in savings accounts and little to spend them on , Soviet consumers grumble at the exorbitant black-market prices for such goods -- but they buy them anyway . </s>
<s> Moscow has already tacitly admitted that the ruble is n't worth much , announcing in August that it will pay Soviet farmers in hard currency for grain and other produce that they grow in excess of state-plan quotas . </s>
<s> `` The absurdity of the official rate should seem obvious to everyone , '' the afternoon newspaper Izvestia wrote in a brief commentary on the devaluation . </s>
<s> The State Bank 's move is part of a drive to iron out exchange-rate discrepancies as Moscow moves toward making the ruble convertible -- a goal that Soviet bankers and economists say is still far away . </s>
<s> Rumors of an impending devaluation have been circulating in Moscow for weeks , but the size of the cut took many Western bankers by surprise . </s>
<s> `` It 's much bigger than we expected , '' said one German banker , who asked not to be named . </s>
<s> The next step , which could have a larger effect on businesses , will come early next month , when the Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs is to hold its first auction of foreign currency . </s>
<s> Soviet companies needing Western currencies to buy equipment and supplies abroad will be able to submit bids . </s>
<s> Plans for the auction , which was supposed to take place last spring and become a regular event , have been thwarted by a lack of hard currency . </s>
<s> Soviet firms that hold some are unwilling to part with it , and joint ventures are n't yet allowed to participate . </s>
<s> The Kremlin also has been unwilling to provide hard currency for the auction , using a lot of it instead to finance emergency imports of consumer goods . </s>
<s> If foreign tourists and businesses could sell their currencies freely at the new , better exchange rate , that would enable the State Bank to increase its dollar reserves and would mop up some of the excess rubles in the economy at the same time . </s>
<s> But the amounts they exchange may be limited ; most Soviet hotels , for example , demand payment in hard currency from Western visitors . </s>
<s> Unless other rules are changed , the devaluation could cause difficulties for the people it is primarily meant to help : Soviets who travel abroad . </s>
<s> Over the past three years , thousands of people here have made use of looser travel restrictions to get their first taste of life abroad . </s>
<s> But under current rules , they are allowed to change just 200 rubles into dollars and other currencies for each trip . </s>
<s> At the new rate , that would give them about $ 30 to travel on . </s>
<s> It is n't yet clear whether the 200-ruble limit will be lifted . </s>
<s> If it is n't , the black market for dollars probably will continue to thrive . </s>
