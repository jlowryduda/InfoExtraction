<s> Office Market Weakens In Overbuilt Northeast </s>
<s> THE NORTHEAST office market is feeling serious aftereffects of the giddy overbuilding of the 1980s . </s>
<s> Foreclosures and other signs of financial distress , most often associated with the real estate market in the Southwest , are surfacing in the suburban office market of the once thriving Northeast . </s>
<s> Some projects are now in the hands of lenders , including a 425,000-square-foot office facility in Little Falls , N.J . </s>
<s> The owners of a 32-acre hotel and office complex in King of Prussia , Pa. , have advertised for new financing . </s>
<s> Rising office vacancy rates in Fairfield County , Conn. , have builders and bankers scrambling to restructure loans . </s>
<s> And in suburban Boston , developers are bracing for cutbacks in the computer industry , a major user of office space . </s>
<s> Many troubled properties have n't been foreclosed on and are hard to identify , says Albert I. Berger , who heads the Secaucus , N.J. , office of Helmsley-Spear Inc. , a real estate brokerage . </s>
<s> Owners are voluntarily -- and quietly -- turning over properties to lenders through `` deeds in lieu of foreclosure . '' </s>
<s> Often , developers stay on as property manager . </s>
<s> Real estate analyst Lloyd Lynford says the Northeast 's distress is masked by relatively low vacancy rates . </s>
<s> But in today 's overbuilt market , tenants have many choices and are negotiating low rents that squeeze building owners . </s>
<s> On average , Mr. Lynford says , it now takes three to 3 1\/2 years to fill new office space , compared with 2 1\/2 years in 1988 . </s>
<s> Beverly Hills Comes To Suburban Tokyo </s>
<s> WHY SHOULD the Japanese cross the Pacific to buy American real estate when they can simply recreate it at home ? </s>
<s> Tokyu Development Corp. is spending $ 500 million to build American-style luxury homes in suburban Tokyo with rarely seen back yards , front yards , swimming pools and tennis courts . </s>
<s> The Japanese company hired Richardson Nagy Martin , a Newport Beach , Calif. , architectural firm , to design what the Japanese press has dubbed `` the Beverly Hills of Tokyo . '' </s>
<s> Instead of Japan 's typical small homes clustered on narrow streets with no sidewalks , the new `` One Hundred Hills '' development will offer 65 houses on half-acre lots . </s>
<s> That 's more than 10 times the usual housing site size . </s>
<s> Buyers with $ 6 million to spend can select from 11 designs , including a Mediterranean-inspired California style , a traditional Yankee look and designs inspired by Midwestern architect Frank Lloyd Wright . </s>
<s> There are spacious living rooms and baths , plus a master grandparents suite and a foyer for removing shoes to suit Japanese life styles . </s>
<s> Exteriors are faced with brick , wood or stone , but the homes are made of steel-reinforced concrete . </s>
<s> `` We were disappointed we could n't use wood , '' says architect Walter J. Richardson , `` but the Japanese only want stronger materials . '' </s>
<s> At $ 1,000 per square foot , the Japanese want the feeling of indestructibility , he explains , not to mention protection from possible earthquake damage . </s>
<s> Housing Developers Try Brand-Name Buildings </s>
<s> RESIDENTIAL builders , faced with a more competitive market , are turning to a traditional consumer marketing technique to establish brand-name identity . </s>
<s> `` One of the difficulties people in real estate have is that each product is like starting a new company , or starting a new line in the fashion business , '' says L. Robert Lieb president of Mountain Development Corp. in West Paterson , N.J . </s>
<s> So he 's using `` river '' in many project names . </s>
<s> `` It 'll never be like what Bristol-Myers does , '' he adds , `` but it helps establish recognition with the public -- and with banks . '' </s>
<s> Weingarten-Siegel Group Inc. of Manalapan , N.J. , has built Cross Creek Pointe , Allegro Pointe and other Pointes in New Jersey . </s>
<s> Caspi Development Corp of Armonk , N.Y. , has developed two apartment buildings called Classic and plans a third . </s>
<s> Developer Steve Caspi says the same brand name indicates consistent quality , `` regardless of location , design or amenities . '' </s>
<s> The leader in real estate brand names is developer Ara Hovnanian . </s>
<s> His entry-price condos are labeled Society Hill . </s>
<s> Beacon Hill is for `` move-up '' town houses , and Nob Hill , for single-family houses . </s>
<s> Because of standardized designs , Mr. Hovnanian says , `` a buyer can visualize Society Hill regardless of where it is . '' </s>
<s> Quake Not Likely to Jolt The Commercial Market </s>
<s> THE EARTHQUAKE in San Francisco has sent few tremors through the hearts of real estate investors . </s>
<s> `` I think there 's a disease called buyer 's regret , and I 'm sure it 's running rampant at this moment , but it gets cured in a short period of time , '' says Kenneth Leventhal , co-managing partner of Kenneth Leventhal & Co. , a Los Angeles accounting firm specializing in real estate . </s>
<s> `` If I were buying a building in San Francisco now the first thing I 'd do is insist on a structural inspection , then I 'd delay a little , stall a little . '' </s>
<s> But like other real estate professionals accustomed to California 's quake risks , Mr. Leventhal anticipates little long-term change in the city 's commercial real estate market . </s>
<s> Still , local builders are eager to tell the world that most of San Francisco does n't look like the TV images of destruction . </s>
<s> Planners of the Urban Land Institute real estate conference this week hastily added a panel on the quake 's effects . </s>
<s> `` The message is we build 'em right , '' says Peter Bedford , a California developer and officer at Urban Land Institute . </s>
<s> `` There 's seven million square feet of space that 's doing great . </s>
