<s> Legal controversies in America have a way of assuming a symbolic significance far exceeding what is involved in the particular case . </s>
<s> They speak volumes about the state of our society at a given moment . </s>
<s> It has always been so . </s>
<s> In the 1920s , a young schoolteacher , John T. Scopes , volunteered to be a guinea pig in a test case sponsored by the American Civil Liberties Union to challenge a ban on the teaching of evolution imposed by the Tennessee Legislature . </s>
<s> The result was a world-famous trial exposing profound cultural conflicts in American life between the `` smart set , '' whose spokesman was H.L. Mencken , and the religious fundamentalists , whom Mencken derided as benighted primitives . </s>
<s> Few now recall the actual outcome : Scopes was convicted and fined $ 100 , and his conviction was reversed on appeal because the fine was excessive under Tennessee law . </s>
<s> So it was with the Hiss case a generation later , when Alger Hiss became a lightning rod for the anxieties of the Cold War and conflicting attitudes toward the New Deal he had served . </s>
<s> His trials aroused public passions out of all proportion to the rather banal secrets he allegedly had passed to Soviet intelligence . </s>
<s> And so it seems to be with the case of Elizabeth Morgan , the Washington , D.C. , plastic surgeon jailed in a child custody case for refusing to reveal the whereabouts of her daughter . </s>
<s> Dr. Morgan has just emerged from the D.C. jail after more than two years ' confinement for contempt of court , a heroine to her many supporters . </s>
<s> To the rest of us , the case is a puzzle . </s>
<s> It is what lawyers call `` fact intensive . '' </s>
<s> It presents no great issue of legal principle , no overriding question of family law or the law of contempt . </s>
<s> Instead , it turns on the disputed and elusive facts of `` who did what to whom . '' </s>
<s> It is difficult , if not impossible , for anyone who has not pored over the thousands of pages of court pleadings and transcripts to have a worthwhile opinion on the underlying merits of the controversy . </s>
<s> Certainly I do not . </s>
<s> So we must look elsewhere for an explanation of the unusual power this case has exerted over the minds of many , not just in Washington but elsewhere in the country and even the world . </s>
<s> I suggest that three themes have come together in the strange case of Dr. Morgan . </s>
<s> The first is that it represents an intense battle in what James Thurber used to caricature as `` the war between the sexes . '' </s>
<s> But although Thurber did so gently and lightheartedly , many of Dr. Morgan 's supporters have taken Thurber 's memorable title `` The Male Animal '' quite literally . </s>
<s> The vehemence of the emotions aroused by the case testifies to its symbolic importance in the war that Thurber accepted as an eternal part of the human condition . </s>
<s> A second theme is the undercurrent of social class and race in the public reaction to the Morgan case . </s>
<s> Dr. Morgan is a highly educated white professional who attended some of the `` best '' schools . </s>
<s> As members of the Black Caucus in Congress asked during the debate on the legislation that freed Dr. Morgan , does anyone seriously believe that if she were an uneducated , black , working-class woman , Congress would have rushed to pass a private relief bill freeing her ? </s>
<s> Or that the president would have hurried to sign the bill `` out of compassion for her plight '' ? </s>
<s> To ask those questions is to answer them . </s>
<s> Finally , the case of Dr. Morgan gave Congress an opportunity to act with unaccustomed decisiveness and to engage in one of its favorite pastimes -- bashing the District of Columbia government . </s>
<s> The local government is discredited in the eyes of many residents for a variety of reasons , and congressmen read the same newspapers and watch the same TV newscasts as other people in the area do . </s>
<s> Bashing the D.C. government is risk-free for members of Congress , who do not have to answer to their own constituents for it . </s>
<s> Congress is paralyzed from acting on such great issues of the day as the federal budget deficit . </s>
<s> Yet a bill tailored to the interests of a single individual passed Congress with almost unimaginable speed , before the judicial process had run its course , and , indeed , while the Morgan case was awaiting a ruling by the appellate court . </s>
<s> The Morgan case thus tells us much more about the current state of sex , class , race and politics in our society than it does about the facts of Dr. Morgan 's particular situation . </s>
<s> It may stand as a metaphor for how wide and deep the divisions in that society continue to be however we try to deny their existence . </s>
<s> Mr. Rezneck is a lawyer in Washington , D.C . </s>
