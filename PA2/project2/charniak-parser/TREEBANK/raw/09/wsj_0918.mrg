<s> Du Pont Co. reported that third-quarter profit grew a robust 19 % from a year ago on the strength of the company 's operations in various chemicals and fibers , and in petroleum . </s>
<s> Du Pont also raised its quarterly dividend to $ 1.20 a share from $ 1.05 , a change that will increase the annualized payout to shareholders by some $ 140 million . </s>
<s> Du Pont , unlike companies hurt badly by sharp price declines for basic chemicals and plastics , is benefiting from its broad range of businesses . </s>
<s> The profit gain was made despite a weakening in the housing market , for which the company is a supplier , and a strengthening in the dollar , which lowers the value of overseas earnings when they are translated into dollars . </s>
<s> The Wilmington , Del. , company reported net of $ 547 million , or $ 2.36 a share , which was in line with Wall Street estimates . </s>
<s> In the year-earlier period , the company earned $ 461 million , or $ 1.91 a share . </s>
<s> Sales in the latest quarter were $ 8.59 billion , up 9.4 % from $ 7.85 billion . </s>
<s> The dividend increase was Du Pont 's second this year , an affirmation of statements by top executives that they intend to increase rewards to shareholders . </s>
<s> `` We have n't benefited the shareholder as much as we need to , '' said Edgar Woolard Jr. , Du Pont 's chairman and chief executive officer , in an interview several months before he entered his current position in April . </s>
<s> The largest beneficiary will be Seagram Co. , which owns about 23 % of Du Pont . </s>
<s> A spokesman for Seagram , the Montreal wine and spirits concern controlled by the Bronfman family , said the company will post additional pretax profit of about $ 33 million a year because of the additional Du Pont dividends . </s>
<s> Du Pont also announced plans for a 3-for-1 stock split , although the initial higher dividend will be paid on pre-split shares . </s>
<s> Du Pont 's stock rose $ 2.50 a share to close at $ 117.375 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday . </s>
<s> Seagram closed at $ 84.75 , up 12.5 cents a share in Big Board trading . </s>
<s> Leading the gains for Du Pont in the latest quarter was its industrial products segment , where profit soared to $ 155 million from $ 99 million a year earlier . </s>
<s> The company benefited from continued strong demand and higher selling prices for titanium dioxide , a white pigment used in paints , paper and plastics . </s>
<s> James Fallon , a New Providence , N.J. , marketing consultant to the chemicals industry , says Du Pont still holds an edge in making the pigment because the company was `` first in with the technology '' to lower costs . </s>
<s> He said Du Pont holds about 23 % of the world-wide market , the largest single share , at a time when growing uses for the pigment have kept it in tight supply , although others are now adding low-cost production capacity . </s>
<s> Profit climbed to $ 98 million from $ 71 million in the petroleum segment , as Du Pont 's Conoco Inc. oil company was helped by crude oil prices higher than a year ago and by higher natural gas prices and volume . </s>
<s> In the diversifed businesses segment , which includes herbicides , profit grew to $ 64 million from $ 27 million . </s>
<s> A spokesman said herbicide use in some areas of the U.S. was delayed earlier in the year by heavy rains , thus increasing sales in the third quarter . </s>
<s> In the fibers segment , profit rose to $ 180 million from $ 155 million , a gain Du Pont attributed to higher demand in the U.S. for most textile products . </s>
<s> Two segments posted lower earnings for the quarter . </s>
<s> Profit from coal fell to $ 41 million from $ 58 million , partly because of a miners ' strike . </s>
<s> And profit from polymers dropped to $ 107 million from $ 122 million amid what Du Pont called lower demand and selling prices in certain packaging and industrial markets . </s>
<s> For the nine months , Du Pont earned $ 2 billion , or $ 8.46 a share , up 18 % from $ 1.69 billion , or $ 7.03 a share , a year earlier . </s>
<s> Sales increased 10 % to $ 26.54 billion from $ 24.05 billion . </s>
