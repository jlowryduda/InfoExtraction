<s> Motorola is fighting back against junk mail . </s>
<s> So much of the stuff poured into its Austin , Texas , offices that its mail rooms there simply stopped delivering it . </s>
<s> Now , thousands of mailers , catalogs and sales pitches go straight into the trash . </s>
<s> `` We just do n't have the staff to -LCB- deliver -RCB- it , nor do we have the space or the time , '' says a spokesman for the Schaumburg , Ill. , electronics company , which has 5,000 employees in the Austin area . </s>
<s> `` It 's the overload problem and the weight problem we have . '' </s>
<s> Motorola is in good company . </s>
<s> Businesses across the country are getting fed up with junk mail , and some are saying they just are n't going to take it anymore -- literally . </s>
<s> While no one has tracked how many company mail rooms throw out junk mail , direct-mail advertising firms say the number is growing . </s>
<s> General Motors earlier this year said it would n't deliver bulk mail or free magazines in its Flint , Mich. , office , while Air Products & Chemicals , Allentown , Pa. , says it screens junk mail and often throws out most of a given mass mailing . </s>
<s> Why the revolt ? </s>
<s> Anybody with a mailbox can answer that : sheer , overwhelming , mind-numbing volume . </s>
<s> According to the Direct Marketing Association , total direct mail -- to both businesses and consumers -- jumped 50 % to 65.4 billion pieces in 1988 from five years earlier . </s>
<s> Though direct mail to businesses is n't broken out separately , the association says it 's growing even faster . </s>
<s> The deluge has spurred cost-conscious companies to action , with mail rooms throwing the stuff out rather than taking the time or money to deliver it . </s>
<s> The direct-mail industry , not surprisingly , is fuming at the injustice of it all . </s>
<s> After all , this is the industry that has a hard enough time getting any respect , that is the butt of so many jokes that television 's `` L.A. Law '' portrays direct-mail-mogul David as short , bald , intensely nerdy , and unremittingly boring . </s>
<s> The practice of businesses throwing out junk mail `` is a commonly known problem , and it 's increasing as companies attempt to put through budget cuts across the board , '' right down to the mail-room level , says Stephen Belth , a list consultant and chairman of the Direct Marketing Association 's business-to-business council . </s>
<s> `` But it 's like biting the hand that feeds them , because every one of these companies uses direct marketing . '' </s>
<s> It 's almost impossible to track the number of companies trashing junk mail , since the decision is usually made in the mail room -- not the board room . </s>
<s> And the practice often varies from location to location even within a company . </s>
<s> But industry executives say businesses seem especially inclined to dump mailers sent to titles rather than to individual names . </s>
<s> Motorola 's Austin operation was one of the first to lose patience , deciding a few years ago to junk any bulk mail that was n't addressed to an individual . </s>
<s> Magazines are n't delivered at all , even if an individual 's name is listed ; employees who want their magazines have to pick them up from the mail room or the company library -- and are told to change the subscriptions to their home addresses . </s>
<s> At Air Products , meanwhile , the mailroom staff opens junk mail and often throws it away -- even if addressed to an individual . </s>
<s> `` If they get 50 packets of something , they open one , see what it says , throw 48 away and send two to people or departments they think are appropriate , '' a spokesman says . </s>
<s> Direct marketers were especially alarmed when General Motors -- one of the country 's largest companies and a big direct-mail user itself -- entered the junk-mail battle . </s>
<s> As of March 1 , its Flint office , with about 2,500 employees , stopped delivering bulk mail and non-subscription magazines . </s>
<s> Employees were told that if they really wanted the publications , they would have to have them sent home instead . </s>
<s> The reason : overload , especially of non-subscription magazines . </s>
<s> Direct-mail executives see GM 's stand as an ominous sign -- even if the junk-mail kings did bring it on themselves . </s>
<s> `` Why anyone would want to close themselves off -LCB- from direct mail -RCB- , a priori , does n't make any sense , '' says Michael Bronner of Bronner Slosberg Associates , a Boston directmail firm . </s>
<s> `` It smacks of big brotherism . </s>
<s> They 're going to decide what their employees can or can not read . '' </s>
<s> The practice is , however , legal in most cases . </s>
<s> Jack Ellis , a U.S. postal inspector in New York , says the Postal Service 's only job is to deliver the mail to the mail room ; once it gets there , a company can do with it what it wishes . </s>
<s> The junk-mail titans , ever optimistic , are looking for ways around the problem . </s>
<s> So far , they say , it has n't had any noticeable effect on response rates . </s>
<s> And before it does , they 're trying to cut back on the clutter that created the situation in the first place . </s>
<s> Among other things , the industry is trying to come up with standardized business lists that cut down on duplications . </s>
<s> `` We 're going to have to mail a lot less and a lot smarter , '' says Jack Miller , president of Quill Corp. , a Lincolnshire , Ill. , business-to-business mail-order company . </s>
<s> But then again , mailing less and smarter wo n't be much help if the mail ends up in the garbage anyway . </s>
<s> New Hyundai Campaign </s>
<s> Hyundai Motor America , fighting quality complaints , declining sales and management turmoil , yesterday unveiled its 1990 ad strategy , tagged `` We 're Making More Sense Than Ever . '' </s>
<s> The ad campaign , created by Saatchi & Saatchi 's Backer Spielvogel Bates agency , is an extension of the auto company 's `` Cars That Make Sense '' campaign , which emphasized affordability . </s>
<s> TV ads plugging the company 's new V-6 Sonata and its souped-up Excel subcompact will begin appearing Monday . </s>
<s> One spot shows a Sonata next to a rival midsized car , and an announcer says , `` Listen to what they 're saying about the Hyundai Sonata . '' </s>
<s> As the announcer reads favorable quotes about the model from Motor Trend and Road & Track magazines , the other car , which is white , slowly turns green . </s>
<s> `` No wonder the competition 's green with envy , '' the announcer says . </s>
<s> Ad Notes ... . </s>
<s> ACQUISITION : </s>
<s> EWDB , formed by the merger of Eurocom and Della Femina McNamee WCRS , said it agreed to buy Vizeversa , an agency in Barcelona . </s>
<s> Terms were n't disclosed . </s>
<s> HOLIDAY ADS : </s>
<s> Seagram will run two interactive ads in December magazines promoting its Chivas Regal and Crown Royal brands . </s>
<s> The Chivas ad illustrates -- via a series of pullouts -- the wild reactions from the pool man , gardener and others if not given Chivas for Christmas . </s>
<s> The three-page Crown Royal ad features a black-and-white shot of a boring holiday party -- and a set of colorful stickers with which readers can dress it up . </s>
<s> Both ads were designed by Omnicom 's DDB Needham agency . </s>
