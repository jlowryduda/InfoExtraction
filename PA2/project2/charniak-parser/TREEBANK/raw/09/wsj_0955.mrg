<s> Richard Breeden had n't noticed that his new desk had just four telephone lines and one phone . </s>
<s> It was , after all , only his second full day as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission . </s>
<s> But the lack of lines became painfully apparent . </s>
<s> As the stock market lurched into a 190-point free fall on Oct. 13 , Mr. Breeden found himself scurrying around the sixth floor of the SEC -- from his desk , where the New York Stock Exchange was on an open line , to his assistant 's office , where the Commodity Futures Trading Commission was connected , to a third room , where a computer monitored market moves . </s>
<s> With other anxious calls pouring in , he recalls , `` I 'd either have to disconnect the New York Stock Exchange or go out to the secretary 's desk . '' </s>
<s> It wo n't happen again . </s>
<s> Now there are more lines connected to the chairman 's office , and the market-monitoring computer has been moved next to his desk . </s>
<s> It 's all part of a new `` command center . '' </s>
<s> The changes in the office layout illustrate Mr. Breeden 's stance as the nation 's top securities regulator . </s>
<s> Like his predecessor , David Ruder , he was faced with a crisis in the stock markets soon after coming into office . </s>
<s> But unlike Mr. Ruder , who during the 1987 crash damaged himself by saying rather offhandedly that the markets might be closed , Mr. Breeden is turning the market drop to his own advantage , using it to further his agenda for the SEC . </s>
<s> In an interview and in congressional testimony , he repeatedly points to the recent 190-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average -- the second-largest ever -- as evidence of the need for Congress to give the SEC the ability to better monitor leveraged buy-out loan activity by brokerage firms and to track big trades in the market . </s>
<s> A veteran of another financial crisis , the savings-and-loan bailout , Mr. Breeden wants to have the SEC regulate securities issued by banks and S&Ls . </s>
<s> More broadly , he wants to `` modernize '' regulation by eliminating barriers between commercial and investment banking and by helping U.S. financial firms compete in the global market . </s>
<s> He believes the tax code encourages the use of debt instead of stock and may fuel leveraged buy-outs , an area the SEC does n't regulate directly but one where it wields influence both on Wall Street and in Congress . </s>
<s> Also unlike Mr. Ruder , Mr. Breeden appears to be in a position to get somewhere with his agenda . </s>
<s> As a former White House aide who worked closely with Congress , he is savvy in the ways of Washington . </s>
<s> What 's more , the coming months likely will offer him the opportunity to obtain his own majority on the five-member commission , enabling him to avoid the dissension that frustrated his predecessor . </s>
<s> But Mr. Breeden , a 39-year-old securities lawyer , has skirted some of the heftier issues facing the financial markets . </s>
<s> For instance , he has n't stated a clear position on high-risk , high-yield junk bonds , an area of growing concern as turmoil in the junk market spills over into stocks . </s>
<s> He may be waiting to see the results of several pending SEC studies of junk market liquidity and disclosure rules . </s>
<s> He also has kept a close wrap on the names of people under consideration for the crucial post of enforcement director at the commission , a job vacant since the summer . </s>
<s> Mr. Breeden 's selection will be scrutinized as an important signal about the strength of his commitment to continuing the SEC 's high-profile pursuit of insider trading and market manipulation on Wall Street . </s>
<s> Congress seems likely to let the new chairman have his way for a while . </s>
<s> Members of the Senate Banking Committee know Mr. Breeden from working on the thrift-bailout bill , and the relationship generally remains warm . </s>
<s> Indeed , during Mr. Breeden 's confirmation hearing last month , senators asked him to introduce his children three separate times -- more often than they asked about his qualifications for the job . </s>
<s> These days , Mr. Breeden is winning praise in Washington and on Wall Street for his behind-the-scenes role in monitoring the Friday-the-13th market plunge and the following Monday 's harrowing morning session . </s>
<s> As a regulator charged with restoring investor confidence , Mr. Breeden avoided making market-jarring comments and worked to gather information critical to Wall Street and to other government agencies . </s>
<s> Not everyone has jumped on the Breeden bandwagon , however . </s>
<s> Some in Washington contend that it 's too soon to tell whether Mr. Breeden will help or hinder the SEC . </s>
<s> `` I do n't think this was a real test , '' says one congressional aide . </s>
<s> `` It was a fairly stressful weekend , but my sense is if you had n't had Richard Breeden there , it would n't have made much of a difference . '' </s>
<s> For some at the SEC , an agency that covets its independence , Mr. Breeden may be too much of a Washington insider . </s>
<s> They note that he has adorned his office with five photos of George Bush , one of them featuring the First Dog , Millie . </s>
<s> They worry that Mr. Breeden also will roll over when told to do so by the White House . </s>
<s> But Mr. Breeden already has shown an eagerness to run the SEC his way . </s>
<s> During the Monday market rebound , a New York exchange spokesman told Cable News Network viewers that the industrial average had turned down 70 points . </s>
<s> Stunned , Mr. Breeden turned to his market-monitoring computer , which by then was next to his desk . </s>
<s> It showed the DJIA up 30 points . </s>
<s> SEC staffers soon determined that a widely watched stock-market service , Quotron , had miscalculated the industrial average . </s>
<s> Mr. Breeden instructed SEC staffers to inform the network that it was airing the wrong number . </s>
<s> `` It was the plunge that did n't happen , '' he says . </s>
<s> Mr. Breeden also is trying to use a far more catastrophic event -- the California earthquake -- to move another rule change past Congress . </s>
<s> That disaster closed the Pacific Stock Exchange 's stock options-trading operation , forcing those options to be switched to other exchanges temporarily . </s>
<s> Though obscure to most investors , the question of whether to list options on more than one exchange has aroused much interest in Congress , mainly because regional exchanges fear the change could bankrupt them . </s>
<s> Congressmen raised the issue yesterday at a hearing . </s>
<s> Mr. Breeden , not missing a chance to press his agenda , cited the earthquake . </s>
<s> That event , he contended , simply shows the `` vulnerability '' of having listings on only one exchange . </s>
