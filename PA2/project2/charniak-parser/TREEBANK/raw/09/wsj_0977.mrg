<s> Merksamer Jewelers Inc. , a fast-growing jewelry store chain , filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection from creditors , apparently to speed a management buy-out of the chain . </s>
<s> The filing , made yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court here , follows an agreement by L.J. Hooker Corp. , Merksamer 's owner , to sell the chain to management for an undisclosed price . </s>
<s> GE Capital Corp. , a financial services subsidiary of General Electric Co. , is providing Merksamer management with $ 15 million in financing . </s>
<s> L.J. Hooker , based in Atlanta , filed for Chapter 11 protection in August and has also announced its intention to sell its B. Altman & Co. department store chain . </s>
<s> L.J. Hooker is owned by Hooker Corp. , Sydney , Australia , which itself is currently being managed by a court-appointed provisional liquidator . </s>
<s> L.J. Hooker 's planned sale of Merksamer is subject to approval by Judge Tina Brozman of U.S. Bankruptcy Court . </s>
<s> Rumors to the effect that the Merksamer chain would file for Chapter 11 arose last week in the jewelry industry . </s>
<s> At that time , Sam Merksamer , president of the chain , angrily denied that his company was about to file . </s>
<s> Mr. Merksamer is leading the buy-out . </s>
<s> According to executives close to the situation , Merksamer filed for Chapter 11 to speed the sale of the chain . </s>
<s> One executive said an accord signed by the unsecured creditors of L.J. Hooker Corp. had frozen in place all of L.J. Hooker 's assets . </s>
<s> The Merksamer bankruptcy-law filing appears to supersede that agreement . </s>
<s> `` By filing for Chapter 11 , the Merksamer chain will only need approval from a bankruptcy judge for the sale , not the hundreds of unsecured creditors , '' said this executive . </s>
<s> `` The cash from the sale will go to L.J. Hooker , but the company itself will belong to Sam Merksamer . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Merksamer and Sanford Sigoloff , chief executive of L.J. Hooker , were unavailable for comment . </s>
<s> In a statement , Mr. Merksamer described the filing as a `` legal technicality , '' but also said that `` our inability to obtain trade credit , combined with a need to ensure that our stores were properly stocked for the Christmas season , necessitated our filing Chapter 11 . '' </s>
<s> The jewelry chain , which is based in Sacramento , Calif. , had revenue of $ 62 million and operating profit of $ 2.5 million for the year ended June 30 . </s>
