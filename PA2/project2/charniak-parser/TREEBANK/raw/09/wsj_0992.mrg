<s> Regarding your Oct. 4 page-one article `` Bad Blood '' on the generic-drug battle : The Epilepsy Institute is not just a patient-advocacy organization . </s>
<s> It is primarily a certified outpatient treatment facility providing comprehensive services to people with epilepsy and their families . </s>
<s> The institute 's advocacy efforts are based on the needs of the population it serves and represents . </s>
<s> In 1985 , the Medical Tribune reported that a growing number of critics are challenging the FDA bioequivalence-therapeutic-equivalence equation . </s>
<s> `` They contend it is based on an assumption that has not yet been proven in valid tests , '' the Tribune said . </s>
<s> In 1986 , some institute patients were reporting breakthrough seizures when they were switched from a specific brand-name medication to a generic one or from one generic manufacturer of a specific product to another . </s>
<s> In addition , neurologists were beginning to report these observations as well . </s>
<s> Call it anecdotal if you will . </s>
<s> But no ethical physician would switch patients who were doing well on a specific medication from a specific manufacturer to prove a point . </s>
<s> We do not depend on pharmaceutical companies for our support . </s>
<s> The institute has governmental service contracts for the provision of direct patient services ; collects patient fees ; receives money through contributions from individuals , foundations and bequests . </s>
<s> The funds received from pharmaceutical firms are used to offset physician symposiums , and these symposiums do not stress any particular medication or manufacturer . </s>
<s> The Epilepsy Institute 's reporting of breakthrough seizures stemmed from concerns about the people we treat and care about daily . </s>
<s> This perhaps was perceived as a `` bold '' stance , and thus suspicious . </s>
<s> But let us not confuse profits of big business masquerading as concerns for people 's health care or for the cost . </s>
<s> For whom is the saving ? </s>
<s> Surely not to people with epilepsy who depend on the same levels of medication in their bloodstream daily to maintain seizure control . </s>
