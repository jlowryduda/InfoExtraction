<s> A volcano will erupt next month on the fabled Strip : a 60-foot mountain spewing smoke and flame every five minutes . </s>
<s> The man-made inferno will tower over a man-made lagoon with more than four acres of pools , grottoes and waterfalls . </s>
<s> Visitors , whisked from the Strip on a moving walkway , will glide over a habitat for rare white tigers , which will star in performances by the famed illusionist team of Siegfried & Roy . </s>
<s> Nearby , six dolphins will frolic in a 1.5 million-gallon saltwater aquarium . </s>
<s> At the core of all this stands a hotel . </s>
<s> In the lobby behind its nine-story , orchid-strewn atrium , a 20,000-gallon aquarium will come alive with sharks , stingrays , angelfish , puffers and other creatures of the deep . </s>
<s> And oh , yes . </s>
<s> There 's a casino , the financial heart of it all . </s>
<s> This is the Mirage , a $ 630 million island-fantasy hotel-casino now being completed for opening in November by Golden Nugget Inc . </s>
<s> It 's the most stunning example of Las Vegas 's concerted effort to transform itself into a world-famous vacation resort for families as well as gamblers . </s>
<s> Las Vegas has seen nothing quite like it before . </s>
<s> Not for 15 years has a big new hotel-casino opened here . </s>
<s> Now the Mirage and Circus Circus Enterprises Inc. 's $ 290 million Excalibur are going up . </s>
<s> The Excalibur , with a castlelike hotel , jousting tournaments and other Arthurian attractions , will be able to handle up to 30,000 visitors a day when it opens in 1990 . </s>
<s> If MGM Grand Inc. proceeds with its plan for an amusement park -- a $ 700 million movieland resort with a working studio , casino and 5,000-room hotel that would become Las Vegas 's biggest -- the investment in the three properties will total some $ 1.6 billion . </s>
<s> MGM Grand has agreed to buy a 117-acre site for the resort for $ 93 million in cash plus stock currently valued at nearly $ 30 million . </s>
<s> Smaller projects swell the figure to at least $ 2.5 billion . </s>
<s> Still other projects that have been announced but not yet started could put expenditures above $ 3 billion over the next few years . </s>
<s> Stephen A. Wynn , who owns 29.4 % of Golden Nugget 's shares , says the Mirage and other projects will help Las Vegas attract a whole new generation of visitors . </s>
<s> `` If you create a wonderment , if you create something so exciting that the public dreams of being part of it , then they 'll come , '' he says . </s>
<s> The projects already under construction will increase Las Vegas 's supply of hotel rooms by 11,795 , or nearly 20 % , to 75,500 . </s>
<s> By a rule of thumb of 1.5 new jobs for each new hotel room , Clark County will have nearly 18,000 new jobs . </s>
<s> The county at the end of 1988 had 307,000 jobs , 95,400 of them in the tourist industry . </s>
<s> Projects in the talking or blueprint stage would add a further 48,000 rooms . </s>
<s> Hotel-casino operators play down the possibility of a labor shortage . </s>
<s> After all , 40,000 newcomers a year are settling in the Las Vegas Valley . </s>
<s> But Nevada state labor economists think a shortage is probable . </s>
<s> Nobody yet seems to have calculated the total number of slot machines , crap tables or roulette wheels Las Vegas will add to the enormous store that Lady Luck already guards here , much less the ultimate impact of the growth on schools and municipal services . </s>
<s> `` Traffic is certainly a concern , as is pollution , water and an adequate labor market , '' says Frank Sain , executive director of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Bureau . </s>
<s> City fathers have managed to push through projects that are crucial for tourist growth , such as the expansion of McCarran International Airport to accommodate the 44 % of Las Vegas tourists who fly here . </s>
<s> This year , by one means of transport or another , more than 18 million people will visit the city . </s>
<s> The expansion will set off a marketing war among the big hotel-casinos . </s>
<s> Las Vegas promises , or threatens , to become a giant carnival , with rooms to be had for $ 45 a day or less , for visitors uninspired solely by gambling . </s>
<s> Amid a riot of jousting knights , circus clowns , gold-leaf centurions and creatures of the wild , lesser competitors will fall . </s>
<s> Caesars World Inc. plans to defend its august reputation by sinking $ 190 million into its opulent Caesars Palace , next door to the new Mirage , and adding a $ 100 million shopping area reminiscent of Rodeo Drive . </s>
<s> The Palace , with its marble fountains and toga parties for high rollers , is already well-known for its Caesarean theme . </s>
<s> The Flamingo Hilton , Imperial Palace , Frontier and others are pouring millions of dollars into facelifts , new room towers and casino floor space just to keep up . </s>
<s> Where 's this huge amount of investment capital coming from ? </s>
<s> Golden Nugget , Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 's first casino client , has borrowed on more than $ 600 million worth of mortgage notes , mostly sold to private investors by Drexel , to build the Mirage . </s>
<s> Other casino owners , Circus Circus among them , are financing their expansion with their own cash and revolving credit lines from local lenders such as First Interstate Bank of Nevada . </s>
<s> Will the investments pay off ? </s>
<s> The growth of Las Vegas tourism in recent years persuades lenders that they will . </s>
<s> Casino revenues and hotel occupancy rates are high . </s>
<s> Last year , the tourists left $ 3 billion with the area 's casinos , nearly 10 % more than in 1987 . </s>
<s> The people with a stake in Nevada 's gambling industry believe that they have barely tapped the potentially huge family trade . </s>
<s> `` If you build a better mousetrap , it will catch more mice , '' says Fred Benninger , chairman of MGM Grand . </s>
<s> Ellen Cokely , a tourist from Alton , Ill. , seems inclined to agree . </s>
<s> `` I 'd love it if my daughter had something else to do here , '' says Ms. Cokely , watching seven-year-old Kristin on the water slide at the Strip 's Wet 'n' Wild water park . </s>
<s> `` Two generations ago , Dad came to Las Vegas by himself for a little diversion , '' says Van Heffner , executive vice president of the Nevada Hotel and Motel Association . </s>
<s> `` One generation ago , Mom joined Dad . </s>
<s> Now , in the '90s , we 're headed toward a total resort environment . '' </s>
<s> Only a decade or so ago , casino managers balked at in-room TV sets and other fripperies that distracted from gambling . </s>
<s> Casinos today offer bowling alleys , water parks , golf courses , tennis courts , lush swimming pools and other diversions , and more such facilities are being designed . </s>
<s> Despite the new emphasis on the family trade , however , tourists in search of naughtier fun than gambling seem certain to find it , with Las Vegas call girls remaining on the scene . </s>
<s> A serious economic downturn , pessimists observe , could hurt the expansionists . </s>
<s> For now , however , the naysayers ' voices are drowned by the roar of cement mixers and the clanging of construction cranes along the Strip . </s>
<s> This is no place for pedestrians , but at 7:30 on a recent morning , when construction choked traffic at the famous Four Corners intersection to one lane , a taxi passenger found it faster to abandon the cab and walk to her destination . </s>
<s> The ferocious competition probably will drive some poorly managed properties into bankruptcy or new ownership . </s>
<s> It has happened before . </s>
<s> The Dunes , the Aladdin and the Riviera were all acquired by the present owners from bankruptcy proceedings spawned by the last recession , in the early 1980s . </s>
<s> Yet that has n't discouraged investors . </s>
<s> Some have bought big chunks of Strip property for what may turn into another wave of building . </s>
<s> Atlantic City casino owner Donald Trump is scouting the Las Vegas market with an eye toward building an appropriately spectacular place . </s>
<s> Even before the huge new projects began , the Strip 's recent expansion squeezed smaller competitors . </s>
<s> Many blue-collar customers of downtown 's no-frills gambling spots have been lured to the Strip or to Laughlin , Nev. , a Colorado River town catering to snowbirds and the recreational-vehicle crowd . </s>
<s> Hotel expansion and an influx of more-discriminating tourists have hurt motels . </s>
<s> Since 1979 , the number of motel rooms has fallen by 17,000 . </s>
<s> Many people here expect a room-rate war as the new projects open . </s>
<s> `` There 's probably going to be some pressure on occupancy and room rates over the next year , but after that you should see the market return to 80%-plus occupancy and regular rates , '' says Paul Rubeli , casino executive at Ramada Inc. , which runs the Tropicana . </s>
<s> Skeptics wonder whether mega-resorts such as the Mirage will be able to squeeze a profit from their cash flow . </s>
<s> The Mirage will cost at least $ 1 million a day to operate . </s>
<s> Mr. Wynn seems confident that it will produce a healthy profit , but some securities analysts doubt it . </s>
<s> Competitors and analysts say that among large existing properties Bally Manufacturing Corp. 's Bally Grand hotel-casino probably will be hardest hit among major properties . </s>
<s> Bally officials decline to discuss the situation . </s>
<s> Bally bought the former MGM Grand hotel-casino from Kirk Kerkorian four years ago . </s>
<s> Only now is it undergoing a badly needed facelift . </s>
<s> Its parking lot is inconvenient , the MGM lion's-head logo still appears in places , and customers still call it the Grand , rather than the Bally Grand . </s>
<s> It has a `` great location , but they 're going to have some real problems when everyone around them opens , '' says Daniel Lee , a Drexel analyst . </s>
<s> Older properties that still have a 1950s image are also vulnerable . </s>
<s> Any hotel-casino without a strong identity will get whacked by the new competition , says Glenn Schaeffer , senior vice president of Circus Circus . </s>
<s> `` If you do n't know what you are , bigger wo n't make you better , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` But it 'll sure make you poorer . '' </s>
<s> Circus Circus 's flagship casino has become the envy of competitors for its ability to vacuum cash from the pockets of vacationing families . </s>
<s> The Circus Circus lures them with low room rates , inexpensive buffets and entertainment for children at no extra charge . </s>
<s> The company 's Excalibur will also appeal to families , of course . </s>
<s> Its castle , Mr. Schaeffer says , will be `` the most compelling piece of folk architecture ever built . '' </s>
<s> Some casino owners have resisted the temptation to add rooms . </s>
<s> Instead , they are spending to reinforce the identity that they believe attracts their customers . </s>
<s> `` More rooms are n't the answer for us , '' says Caesars World chairman Henry Gluck . </s>
<s> While his company 's hotel is building a retail complex in Beverly Hills style and redoing existing rooms , it has decreased the number of its rooms . </s>
<s> Some have been combined into suites for the high rollers . </s>
<s> Caesars has made a specialty of catering to high rollers from abroad , who are also being aggressively courted by the Mirage , the Las Vegas Hilton and others . </s>
<s> Other , smaller concerns are also pursuing market niches -- Hawaiian tourists , for example , or the local trade . </s>
<s> `` There 's still room for boutique properties , '' says James Barrett , president of MarCor Resorts Inc . </s>
<s> Off the Strip , MarCor is building the Rio , a hotel-casino with a Brazilian theme and only 430 rooms -- all of them suites . </s>
<s> Despite the proliferation of tourist distractions , Las Vegans have n't forgot that gambling is still what the town is all about . </s>
<s> `` The days when when the thrust of casinos was all high rollers , with no windows and clocks and lots of red and black decor , are gone , '' Mr. Sain of the visitors ' bureau says . </s>
<s> `` But 93 % of tourists still come for gambling . </s>
<s> We ca n't lose sight of that . </s>
