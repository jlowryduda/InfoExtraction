<s> This year is the 75th anniversary of the Federal Reserve System , and some members of Congress think it 's time to take a fresh look at the nation 's central bank . </s>
<s> After 75 years there may be a few things that are worth reexamining . </s>
<s> The regional Federal Reserve Bank setup , for instance , may be out of date . </s>
<s> In earlier years it may have seemed reasonable to give Richmond , Va. , a bank and allow Los Angeles only a branch of the San Francisco bank , but times have changed . </s>
<s> Maybe the whole regional system is an anachronism ; the Fed , after all , is a national central bank . </s>
<s> Some of the would-be reformers , however , want to restore an arrangement we once had -- or , at least , part of it . </s>
<s> In the beginning , the treasury secretary and the comptroller of the currency were both ex officio members of the Federal Reserve Board . </s>
<s> But in 1935 , when Congress was trying to find someone or something to blame for the Great Depression , it decided to drop both the secretary and the comptroller from the board . </s>
<s> Carter Glass , a former treasury secretary who was then back in Congress , probably influenced the decision . </s>
<s> He said that when he was on the board he felt that he had a great deal of power and , somehow , he did n't think that was a good thing . </s>
<s> Times have changed . </s>
<s> Rep. Byron Dorgan -LRB- D. , N.D . -RRB- has introduced a bill in Congress , co-sponsored by Rep. Lee Hamilton -LRB- D. , Ind. -RRB- , that would put the treasury secretary back on the board . </s>
<s> There is doubt that the change would accomplish much but at least Congress , as in 1935 , would be doing something . </s>
<s> So far no one has suggested putting the comptroller back on the board . </s>
<s> Nicholas Brady , the incumbent treasury secretary , is of course aware of the proposal , and he does n't like it much . </s>
<s> Mr. Dorgen has changed tactics , dropping the seat-for-the-secretary idea . </s>
<s> That may have pleased the secretary , but H. Erich Heinemann , chief economist of the investment firm of Ladenburg , Thalmann & Co. , suggests that Mr. Brady may figure he already has all the power he needs . </s>
<s> Like most treasury secretaries , Mr. Brady takes a keen interest in monetary matters , of course . </s>
<s> He was , in fact , taking an especially keen interest in board matters even before he went to the treasury . </s>
<s> After the October 1987 market crash , Mr. Brady as a private citizen headed a presidential commission that tried to decide what went wrong and what should be done about it . </s>
<s> One of the commission 's recommendations was that a single agency , probably the Federal Reserve , should coordinate regulation of all financial markets . </s>
<s> This recommendation might have encouraged a turf-hungry bureaucrat to try to expand his power , but so far Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has n't made a pitch for the job . </s>
<s> The Fed has plenty of responsibilities in times of market turmoil and in 1987 and again in 1989 it appears to have handled them well . </s>
<s> Mr. Brady has said he thought government agencies in the latest market drop were better prepared to coordinate their actions , but he has left no doubt that he still likes the ideas the commission advanced nearly two years ago . </s>
<s> In recent weeks , moreover , Mr. Brady has joined other administration officials in trying to urge the Fed toward lower interest rates . </s>
<s> The urging admittedly has been gentle . </s>
<s> In an interview with the Washington Post in early October , the secretary said the Fed may be slightly more interested in curbing inflation than the administration is , while the administration may put slightly more emphasis on spurring economic growth . </s>
<s> At least some economists , of course , would argue that inflation deserves a lot of emphasis . </s>
<s> Earlier this month the St. Louis Fed held a conference to assess the system 's first 75 years . </s>
<s> Allan Meltzer , a Carnegie-Mellon University economist , noted that the Fed 's record included the longest , most sustained , peacetime inflation in our history , dating from either 1966 or 1967 to 1989 . </s>
<s> The inflation-growth argument is an old one , but Mr. Brady , on the board or off , is surely trying to influence Fed policy . </s>
<s> Equally importantly , the treasury secretary has spearheaded the administration effort to bring the U.S. dollar down by shopping avidly for West German marks and Japanese yen . </s>
<s> The treasury can do something on its own , but to have any hope of success it needs help from the Fed . </s>
<s> The central bank has been helping , but apparently not especially eagerly . </s>
<s> The Fed has been intervening in foreign currency markets , all right , but through August , at least , it appeared to be `` sterilizing '' the intervention . </s>
<s> In other words , it was offsetting purchases of marks and yen by buying dollars in the domestic money market . </s>
<s> Now , sterilized intervention may have some effect . </s>
<s> When traders see the Fed is in the exchange market it may make them tread a little carefully , for fear of what the central bank may do . </s>
<s> But it 's generally accepted that sterilized intervention has little or no lasting impact on currency values . </s>
<s> After August the Fed may have stopped sterilizing , but it 's hard to see much impact on the dollar . </s>
<s> The dollar is still highly volatile . </s>
<s> The Fed has let interest rates slip slightly , but whether the main reason was dollar intervention , the gloomy reports on manufacturing employment , or the Friday 13 market drop , only Mr. Greenspan and his associates know . </s>
<s> Earlier this year , Martin Feldstein , president of the National Bureau of Economic Research , argued forcefully that a government that wants steady , stable exchange rates might try some steady stable economic policies . </s>
<s> Trying to manage exchange rates to some desired level , he said , `` would mean diverting monetary and fiscal policies from their customary roles and thereby risking excessive inflation and unemployment and inadequate capital formation . '' </s>
<s> The more we think about it , the more we suspect Mr. Brady does indeed have enough power where he already is . </s>
