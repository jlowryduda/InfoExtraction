<s> Right away you notice the following things about a Philip Glass concert . </s>
<s> It attracts people with funny hair -LRB- or with no hair -- in front of me a girl with spiked locks sat beside a boy who had shaved his -RRB- . </s>
<s> Whoever constitute the local Left Bank come out in force , dressed in black , along with a smattering of yuppies who want to be on the cutting edge . </s>
<s> People in Glass houses tend to look stoned . </s>
<s> And , if still conscious at the evening 's end , you notice something else : The audience , at first entranced and hypnotized by the music , releases its pent-up feelings in collective gratitude . </s>
<s> Currently in the middle of a four-week , 20-city tour as a solo pianist , Mr. Glass has left behind his synthesizers , equipment and collaborators in favor of going it alone . </s>
<s> He sits down at the piano and plays . </s>
<s> And plays . </s>
<s> Either one likes it or one does n't . </s>
<s> The typical Glass audience , which is more likely to be composed of music students than their teachers , certainly does . </s>
<s> The work , though , sounds like Muzak for spaceships . </s>
<s> Philip Glass is the emperor , and his music the new clothes , of the avant-garde . </s>
<s> His success is easy to understand . </s>
<s> Softly introducing and explaining his pieces , Mr. Glass looks and sounds more like a shaggy poet describing his work than a classical pianist playing a recital . </s>
<s> The piano compositions , which have been labeled variously as minimalist , Oriental , repetitive , cyclical , monophonic and hypnotic , are relentlessly tonal -LRB- therefore unthreatening -RRB- , unvaryingly rhythmic -LRB- therefore soporific -RRB- , and unflaggingly harmonious but unmelodic -LRB- therefore both pretty and unconventional -RRB- . </s>
<s> It is music for people who want to hear something different but do n't want to work especially hard at the task . </s>
<s> It is E-Z listening for the now generation . </s>
<s> Mr. Glass has inverted the famous modernist dictum `` less is more . '' </s>
<s> His more is always less . </s>
<s> Far from being minimalist , the music unabatingly torments us with apparent novelties not so cleverly disguised in the simplicities of 4\/4 time , octave intervals , and ragtime or gospel chord progressions . </s>
<s> But the music has its charm , and Mr. Glass has constructed his solo program around a move from the simple to the relatively complex . </s>
<s> `` Opening '' -LRB- 1981 -RRB- , from Glassworks , introduces the audience to the Glass technique : Never straying too far from the piano 's center , Mr. Glass works in the two octaves on either side of middle C , and his fingers seldom leave the keys . </s>
<s> There is a recognizable musical style here , but not a particular performance style . </s>
<s> The music is not especially pianistic ; indeed , it 's hard to imagine a bad performance of it . </s>
<s> Nothing bravura , no arpeggios , no ticklish fingering problems challenge the performer . </s>
<s> We hear , we may think , inner voices , but they all seem to be saying the same thing . </s>
<s> With `` Planet News , '' music meant to accompany readings of Allen Ginsberg 's `` Wichita Vortex Sutra , '' Mr. Glass gets going . </s>
<s> His hands sit farther apart on the keyboard . </s>
<s> Seventh chords make you feel as though he may break into a -LRB- very slow -RRB- improvisatory riff . </s>
<s> The chords modulate , but there is little filigree even though his fingers begin to wander over more of the keys . </s>
<s> Contrasts predictably accumulate : First the music is loud , then it becomes soft , then -LRB- you realize -RRB- it becomes louder again . </s>
<s> `` The Fourth Knee Play , '' an interlude from `` Einstein on the Beach , '' is like a toccata but it does n't seem to move much beyond its left-hand ground in `` Three Blind Mice . '' </s>
<s> When Mr. Glass decides to get really fancy , he crosses his hands and hits a resonant bass note with his right hand . </s>
<s> He does this in at least three of his solo pieces . </s>
<s> You might call it a leitmotif or a virtuoso accomplishment . </s>
<s> In `` Mad Rush , '' which came from a commission to write a piece of indeterminate length -LRB- Mr. Glass charmingly , and tellingly , confessed that `` this was no problem for me '' -RRB- , an A section alternates with a B section several times before the piece ends unresolved . </s>
<s> Not only is the typical Glasswork open-ended , it is also often multiple in its context -LRB- s -RRB- . </s>
<s> `` Mad Rush '' began its life as the accompaniment to the Dalai Lama 's first public address in the U.S. , when Mr. Glass played it on the organ at New York 's Cathedral of St. John the Divine . </s>
<s> Later it was performed on Radio Bremen in Germany , and then Lucinda Childs took it for one of her dance pieces . </s>
<s> The point is that any piece can be used as background music for virtually anything . </s>
<s> The evening ended with Mr. Glass 's `` Metamorphosis , '' another multiple work . </s>
<s> Parts 1 , 2 , and 5 come from the soundtrack of Errol Morris 's acclaimed film , `` The Thin Blue Line , '' and the two other parts from incidental music to two separate dramatizations of the Kafka story of the same name . </s>
<s> When used as background in this way , the music has an appropriate eeriness , as when a two-note phrase , a descending minor third , accompanies the seemingly endless litany of reports , interviews and confessions of witnesses in the Morris film . </s>
<s> Served up as a solo , however , the music lacks the resonance provided by a context within another medium . </s>
<s> Admirers of Mr. Glass may agree with the critic Richard Kostelanetz 's sense that the 1974 `` Music in Twelve Parts '' is as encyclopedic and weighty as `` The Well-Tempered Clavier . '' </s>
<s> But while making the obvious point that both composers develop variations from themes , this comparison ignores the intensely claustrophobic nature of Mr. Glass 's music . </s>
<s> Its supposedly austere minimalism overlays a bombast that makes one yearn for the astringency of neoclassical Stravinsky , the genuinely radical minimalism of Berg and Webern , and what in retrospect even seems like concision in Mahler . </s>
<s> Mr. Spiegelman is professor of English at Southern Methodist University and editor of the Southwest Review . </s>
