<s> The Pentagon is a haunted house . </s>
<s> Living there for six years was really scary . </s>
<s> The ghosts of the past are everywhere : They are kept at bay only by feeding them vast quantities of our defense budget . </s>
<s> Some can be bought off relatively cheaply . </s>
<s> During the Korean War , Gen. Douglas MacArthur demanded and got , in addition to his U.N. command in Korea , his own naval command in Japan , NavforJapan . </s>
<s> Those obsolete operations cost less than $ 2 billion a year , and keep Mac 's ghost quiet . </s>
<s> That 's about all it costs to appease Adm. Erich Raeder 's ghost . </s>
<s> In 1941 , Raeder and the German navy threatened to attack the Panama Canal , so we created the Southern Command in Panama . </s>
<s> The Southern Command has grown even bigger since the war because Raeder 's ghost sometimes runs through the E ring dressed like Gen. Noriega . </s>
<s> The Command 's huge bureaucracy is needed to analyze whether leaders of coups against Gen. Noriega meet the War Powers Act 's six points , Cap Weinberger 's seven points , the Intelligence Committee 's 32 points and Woodrow Wilson 's 14 points necessary to justify U.S. support . </s>
<s> So far no one has . </s>
<s> The ghost of the Soviet brigade discovered in Cuba back in the '70s costs just a few hundred million : the price of the Caribbean Command in Key West that President Carter created in 1980 . </s>
<s> The brigade has n't been heard from since , but we keep the staff around just in case . </s>
<s> George Marshall 's ghost is much more difficult to keep happy . </s>
<s> We keep a lot of shrines to him around the Pentagon : statues , busts , relics and such . </s>
<s> The Army headquarters on the third deck of the Pentagon used to burn a lot of incense to him , but the Navy headquarters on the fourth deck made them stop it . </s>
<s> You see , Marshall had this thing about the Navy and the Marines -- he wanted to make them part of the Army but Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal blocked him . </s>
<s> Now his ghost wo n't let up till it 's done . </s>
<s> To keep him quiet we invent a new unified command every year or so run by the Army or the Air Force and put more of the Navy and Marines under it . </s>
<s> But we still hear him moaning at night because the Navy has a few ships left , and to satisfy him the Navy 's sea lift forces were given to a new Air Force bureaucracy in Illinois , its space operations to another command in Colorado , the frogmen to a new Army bureaucracy in Fort Bragg , and the Navy 's Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf forces to an Army bureaucracy in Florida . </s>
<s> Which brings up the worst and meanest ghost of all -- the ghost of the shah of Iran . </s>
<s> When the shah died , President Carter was so scared that the shah 's ghost would blame him for shoving him out to make way for the ayatollah that he declared the Carter Doctrine . </s>
<s> Mr. Carter said he would go to war to stop anyone from trying to grab Iran . </s>
<s> But that ghost would n't settle for words , he wanted money and people -- lots . </s>
<s> So Mr. Carter formed three new Army divisions and gave them to a new bureaucracy in Tampa called the Rapid Deployment Force . </s>
<s> But that ghost was n't fooled ; he knew the RDF was neither rapid nor deployable nor a force -- even though it cost $ 8 billion or $ 10 billion a year . </s>
<s> After Mr. Carter was defeated in 1980 , the shah 's ghost claimed the credit and then went after President Reagan and Cap Weinberger . </s>
<s> I saw what he did to them firsthand . </s>
<s> It made my shoelaces dance with terror . </s>
<s> Why , he used to lay in wait for Cap ; suddenly he 'd leap from behind some statue of Marshall onto Cap 's chest and grab him by the throat and choke him till he coughed up an additional $ 2 billion or so . </s>
<s> Cap added four more divisions to the Army , two active and two reserve ; two carrier groups to the Navy ; a division -- equivalent to the Marines ; and the C-5B , KC-10 , C-17 and a thousand tactical aircraft to the Air Force . </s>
<s> He bought $ 4 billion in prepositioning ships and $ 7 billion in ammo and equipment to fill them , and parked them at a new $ 6 billion base at Diego Garcia in the middle of the Indian Ocean . </s>
<s> He dedicated all these new forces to the Persian Gulf . </s>
<s> One night both Marshall 's ghost and the shah 's ghost together caught Cap and threw him to the ground . </s>
<s> Before they let him go he added a thousand bureaucrats to the RDF in Tampa and renamed it Central Command . </s>
<s> He gave those bureaucrats charge of all naval operations in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean . </s>
<s> Marshall figured it would be good training for those soldiers -- someday maybe they would get the whole Navy . </s>
<s> They had fun moving the carriers around , but it turned out that they had forgotten all about mine sweepers . </s>
<s> But the shah still kept leaping out at Cap , so Cap bought a hundred merchant ships more and $ 7 billion of loading barges , ramps , etc. , in order that those seven new Army divisions and three Marine brigades could unload from all those new ships and aircraft and go to war in the Zagros mountains . </s>
<s> Then suddenly Ike 's ghost came to visit and said , `` What the hell are you doing planning for a land war in Asia 12,000 miles away ? </s>
<s> We 'd get our asses kicked . '' </s>
<s> Lucky for Cap , Ike was easygoing and soon went away , while the shah -- he kept coming back . </s>
<s> So the U.S. found itself paying about $ 2 billion in baksheesh to various Arab potentates for basing rights around the Indian Ocean . </s>
<s> We had great success in Somalia . </s>
<s> But then it turned out that President Siad Barrah was not at all a nice person and the Navy pointed out that the base he promised us in Berbera had silted up about a hundred years ago and anyway was 1,244 miles from the mouth of the Gulf . </s>
<s> -LRB- But who 's counting . -RRB- </s>
<s> Still , Berbera was the best we could get , so we stay in bed with President Barrah . </s>
<s> All these reports about him committing genocide are probably exaggerated anyway . </s>
<s> But would n't you know , now that we are spending jillions of dollars , and have built those new divisions and new air wings , and have positioned all these ships and supplies to fight the Russians in Iran , the Russians seem to have lost interest in the whole subject . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , Congress is cutting huge chunks out of the rest of the defense budget . </s>
<s> Predictably , some Navy guys said : `` Do we still need to keep all 18 Army divisions on active duty and all those extra land-based aircraft without bases and all those Army guys playing admiral in Tampa ? </s>
<s> Could n't we save $ 20 billion or $ 30 billion a year by shifting that stuff to the reserves ? </s>
<s> And why not save the costs of a thousand bureaucrats by abolishing Central Command and putting responsibility for Gulf naval operations back where it belongs , afloat with the task force commander in the Gulf ? </s>
<s> And where were all our handsomely paid Indian Ocean allies last year when our convoys were being attacked ? '' </s>
<s> Questions like that really stir up Marshall 's ghost . </s>
<s> He appeared late one night in the bedroom of the new defense secretary , Dick Cheney . </s>
<s> Marshall came clanking in like Marley 's ghost dragging those chains of brigades and air wings and links with Arab despots . </s>
<s> He would n't leave until Mr. Cheney promised to do whatever the Pentagon systems analysts told him . </s>
<s> So next day Mr. Cheney went out and did just that : He canceled the 600-ship Navy and cut back one carrier and 20 frigates . </s>
<s> Then he canceled production of the Navy 's most important carrier aircraft , the F-14 and the A-6 . </s>
<s> On the other hand , Mr. Cheney retained all those new land forces . </s>
<s> Marshall 's ghost is satisfied for now , but he 'll be back . </s>
<s> What with Halloween coming and bigger defense cuts looming , more and more Pentagon bureaucrats are crawling under their desks . </s>
<s> They know that they can hold off the ghosts only a little while longer by cutting carriers and ships . </s>
<s> Then the whole thing will start to collapse , just as it did in the 1970s , and the ghosts and banshees will be howling through the place turning people 's hair white . </s>
<s> Gives me the willies just thinking about it . </s>
<s> Mr. Lehman , a Reagan Navy secretary , is a managing director of PaineWebber . </s>
