<s> K mart Corp. agreed to acquire Pace Membership Warehouse Inc. for $ 23 a share , or $ 322 million , in a move to expand its presence in the rapidly growing warehouse-club business . </s>
<s> The proposed merger comes as K mart 's profit is declining and sales at its core discount stores are rising more slowly than at such competitors as Wal-Mart Stores Inc . </s>
<s> K mart , based in Troy , Mich. , recently said net income would fall for the third consecutive quarter , after a 16 % drop in the first half of its current fiscal year . </s>
<s> `` The membership warehouse-club concept has great potential , '' the company 's chairman , Joseph E. Antonini , said in a statement . </s>
<s> Warehouse clubs typically carry general merchandise and food products , which they sell for close to wholesale prices in no-frills stores . </s>
<s> Shoppers , many of whom operate small businesses , pay annual membership fees , which provide an income base for the stores . </s>
<s> K mart tested the warehouse-club sector last year with its acquisition of a 51 % interest in Makro Inc . </s>
<s> But the Makro chain , which operates as a joint venture between K mart and SHV Holdings N.V. of the Netherlands , has only six stores and annual sales that one analyst estimated at about $ 300 million . </s>
<s> Six-year-old Pace , based in Aurora , Colo. , operates 41 warehouse-club stores . </s>
<s> The company had losses for several years before turning profitable in fiscal 1988 . </s>
<s> In the year ended Jan. 31 , Pace rang up profit of $ 9.4 million , or 72 cents a share , after a tax-loss carry-forward , on sales of $ 1.3 billion , and analysts expect its results to continue to improve . </s>
<s> `` The company turned the corner fairly recently in profitability , '' said Margo McGlade of PaineWebber Inc. , who had been forecasting a 46 % jump in Pace 's net income from operations this year and another 42 % increase next year . </s>
<s> `` Warehouse productivity is really beginning to take off . '' </s>
<s> But some analysts contend K mart has agreed to pay too much for Pace . </s>
<s> `` Even if you look at it as a turnaround situation , it 's expensive , '' said Wayne Hood of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc . </s>
<s> `` In my opinion , you would only pay that kind of price if you were getting a premier player in the industry . '' </s>
<s> Ms. McGlade of PaineWebber raised a more fundamental question about the deal . </s>
<s> `` If K mart ca n't get its act together in discounting , why is it spending time worrying about other growing markets ? '' </s>
<s> She said , `` I would say K mart 's number one job is to address its market-share loss -LCB- in discount stores -RCB- , which longer-term will lead to improved profit margins . </s>
<s> At that point , perhaps diversification would be appropriate . '' </s>
<s> But K mart 's Mr. Antonini is intent on pushing the company into new retail businesses . </s>
<s> For instance , K mart is opening big food and general merchandise stores , called hypermarkets , and warehouse-type stores specializing in office products and sporting goods . </s>
<s> It also operates Waldenbooks , Pay Less Drug Stores and Builders Square home improvement stores . </s>
<s> In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , K mart closed yesterday at $ 36 a share , up 12.5 cents . </s>
<s> Pace rose $ 2.625 to close at $ 22.125 a share in national over-the-counter trading . </s>
<s> A K mart spokesman said the acquisition would be financed with short-term borrowings . </s>
<s> Under terms of the agreement , a K mart subsidiary will soon make a tender offer for Pace shares . </s>
<s> Among the conditions of the offer is that Pace shareholders tender a majority of the company 's shares outstanding . </s>
<s> The companies said Pace would ill continue to operate under its present management . </s>
