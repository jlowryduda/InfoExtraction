<s> Consumers may want to move their telephones a little closer to the TV set . </s>
<s> Couch-potato jocks watching ABC 's `` Monday Night Football '' can now vote during halftime for the greatest play in 20 years from among four or five filmed replays . </s>
<s> Two weeks ago , viewers of several NBC daytime consumer segments started calling a 900 number for advice on various life-style issues . </s>
<s> And the new syndicated `` reality '' show `` Hard Copy '' records viewers ' opinions for possible airing on the next day 's show . </s>
<s> Interactive telephone technology has taken a new leap in sophistication , and television programmers are racing to exploit the possibilities . </s>
<s> Eventually viewers may grow bored with the technology and resent the cost . </s>
<s> But right now programmers are figuring that viewers who are busy dialing up a range of services may put down their remote control zappers and stay tuned . </s>
<s> `` We 've been spending a lot of time in Los Angeles talking to TV production people , '' says Mike Parks , president of Call Interactive , which supplied technology for both ABC Sports and NBC 's consumer minutes . </s>
<s> `` With the competitiveness of the television market these days , everyone is looking for a way to get viewers more excited . '' </s>
<s> One of the leaders behind the expanded use of 900 numbers is Call Interactive , a joint venture of giants American Express Co. and American Telephone & Telegraph Co . </s>
<s> Formed in August , the venture weds AT&T 's newly expanded 900 service with 200 voice-activated computers in American Express 's Omaha , Neb. , service center . </s>
<s> Other long-distance carriers have also begun marketing enhanced 900 service , and special consultants are springing up to exploit the new tool . </s>
<s> Blair Entertainment , a New York firm that advises TV stations and sells ads for them , has just formed a subsidiary -- 900 Blair -- to apply the technology to television . </s>
<s> The use of 900 toll numbers has been expanding rapidly in recent years . </s>
<s> For a while , high-cost pornography lines and services that tempt children to dial -LRB- and redial -RRB- movie or music information earned the service a somewhat sleazy image , but new legal restrictions are aimed at trimming excesses . </s>
<s> The cost of a 900 call is set by the originator -- ABC Sports , for example -- with the cheapest starting at 75 cents . </s>
<s> Billing is included in a caller 's regular phone bill . </s>
<s> From the fee , the local phone company and the long-distance carrier extract their costs to carry the call , passing the rest of the money to the originator , which must cover advertising and other costs . </s>
<s> In recent months , the technology has become more flexible and able to handle much more volume . </s>
<s> Before , callers of 900 numbers would just listen and not talk , or they 'd vote `` yes '' or `` no '' by calling one of two numbers . </s>
<s> -LRB- People in the phone business call this technology `` 900 click . '' -RRB- </s>
<s> Now , callers are led through complex menus of choices to retrieve information they want , and the hardware can process 10,000 calls in 90 seconds . </s>
<s> Up to now , 900 numbers have mainly been used on local TV stations and cable channels . </s>
<s> MTV used one to give away the house that rock star Jon Bon Jovi grew up in . </s>
<s> For several years , Turner Broadcasting System 's Cable News Network has invited viewers to respond nightly to topical issues -LRB- `` Should the U.S. military intervene in Panama ? '' -RRB- , but even the hottest controversies on CNN log only about 10,000 calls . </s>
<s> The newest uses of the 900-interactive technology demonstrate the growing variety of applications . </s>
<s> Capital Cities\/ABC Inc. , CBS Inc. and General Electric Co. 's National Broadcasting Co. unit are expected to announce soon a joint campaign to raise awareness about hunger . </s>
<s> The subject will be written into the plots of prime-time shows , and viewers will be given a 900 number to call . </s>
<s> Callers will be sent educational booklets , and the call 's modest cost will be an immediate method of raising money . </s>
<s> Other network applications have very different goals . </s>
<s> ABC Sports was looking for ways to lift deflated halftime ratings for `` Monday Night Football . '' </s>
<s> Kurt Sanger , ABC Sports 's marketing director , says that now `` tens of thousands '' of fans call its 900 number each week to vote for the best punt return , quarterback sack , etc . </s>
<s> Profit from the calls goes to charity , but ABC Sports also uses the calls as a sales tool : After thanking callers for voting , Frank Gifford offers a football videotape for $ 19.95 , and 5 % of callers stay on the line to order it . </s>
<s> Jackets may be sold next . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , NBC Sports recently began `` Scores Plus , '' a year-round , 24-hour 900 line providing a complex array of scores , analysis and fan news . </s>
<s> A spokesman said its purpose is `` to bolster the impression that NBC Sports is always there for people . '' </s>
<s> NBC 's `` On-Line '' consumer minutes have increased advertiser spending during the day , the network 's weakest period . </s>
<s> Each weekday matches a sponsor and a topic : On Mondays , Unilever N.V. 's Lever Bros. sponsors tips on diet and exercise , followed by a 30-second Lever Bros. commercial . </s>
<s> Viewers can call a 900 number for additional advice , which will be tailored to their needs based on the numbers they punch -LRB- `` Press one if you 're pregnant , '' etc . -RRB- . </s>
<s> If the caller stays on the line and leaves a name and address for the sponsor , coupons and a newsletter will be mailed , and the sponsor will be able to gather a list of desirable potential customers . </s>
<s> Diane Seaman , an NBC-TV vice president , says NBC has been able to charge premium rates for this ad time . </s>
<s> She would n't say what the premium is , but it 's believed to be about 40 % above regular daytime rates . </s>
<s> `` We were able to get advertisers to use their promotion budget for this , because they get a chance to do couponing , '' says Ms. Seaman . </s>
<s> `` And we were able to attract some new advertisers because this is something new . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Parks of Call Interactive says TV executives are considering the use of 900 numbers for `` talk shows , game shows , news and opinion surveys . '' </s>
<s> Experts are predicting a big influx of new shows in 1990 , when a service called `` automatic number information '' will become widely available . </s>
<s> This service identifies each caller 's phone number , and it can be used to generate instant mailing lists . </s>
<s> `` Hard Copy , '' the new syndicated tabloid show from Paramount Pictures , will use its 900 number for additional purposes that include research , says executive producer Mark B. von S. Monsky . </s>
<s> `` For a piece on local heroes of World War II , we can ask people to leave the name and number of anyone they know who won a medal , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` That 'll save us time and get people involved . '' </s>
<s> But Mr. Monsky sees much bigger changes ahead . </s>
<s> `` These are just baby steps toward real interactive video , which I believe will be the biggest thing yet to affect television , '' he says . </s>
<s> Although it would be costly to shoot multiple versions , TV programmers could let audiences vote on different endings for a movie . </s>
<s> Fox Broadcasting experimented with this concept last year when viewers of `` Married ... With Children '' voted on whether Al should say `` I love you '' to Peg on Valentine 's Day . </s>
<s> Someday , viewers may also choose different depths of news coverage . </s>
<s> `` A menu by phone could let you decide , ` I 'm interested in just the beginning of story No. 1 , and I want story No. 2 in depth , '' Mr. Monsky says . </s>
<s> `` You 'll start to see shows where viewers program the program . </s>
