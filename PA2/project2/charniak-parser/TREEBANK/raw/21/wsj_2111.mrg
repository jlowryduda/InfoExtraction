<s> Japanese Firms Push Posh Car Showrooms </s>
<s> JAPANESE luxury-car makers are trying to set strict design standards for their dealerships . </s>
<s> But some dealers are negotiating looser terms , while others decline to deal at all . </s>
<s> Nissan Motor Co. 's Infiniti division likes to insist that every dealer construct and furnish a building in a Japanese style . </s>
<s> Specifications include a polished bronze sculpture at the center of each showroom and a tile bridge spanning a stream that flows into the building from outside . </s>
<s> `` Infiniti has it down to the ashtrays , '' says Jay Ferron , a partner at J.D. Power & Associates , an auto research firm . </s>
<s> Toyota Motor Corp. 's Lexus division also provides specifications . </s>
<s> But only two-thirds of Lexus dealers are constructing new buildings according to the Lexus specs . </s>
<s> Some are even coming up with their own novel designs . </s>
<s> In Louisville , Ky. , for example , David Peterson has built a Lexus dealership with the showroom on the second floor . </s>
<s> Yet some dealers have turned down Infiniti or Lexus franchises because they were unwilling or unable to meet the design requirements . </s>
<s> Lee Seidman of Cleveland says Infiniti `` was a bear on interiors '' but at least let him retrofit an existing building -- without the stream . </s>
<s> Mr. Seidman says he turned down a Lexus franchise in part because `` the building was gorgeous but very expensive . '' </s>
<s> To head off arguments , Infiniti offers dealers cash bonuses and low-interest construction loans . </s>
<s> Dictation Device 's Saga Plays Back a Lesson </s>
<s> PRODUCTS DON'T have to be first to be winners . </s>
<s> That 's the lesson offered through one case study featured in a design exhibit . </s>
<s> Dictaphone Corp. was caught off guard in 1974 when its main competitor , Lanier Office Products of Japan , introduced a microcassette dictation recorder half the size of standard cassette devices . </s>
<s> Blocked by patent protection from following suit , Dictaphone decided to go a step further and cut the cassette in half again -- down to the length of a paperclip . </s>
<s> By 1979 , designers and engineers at Dictaphone , a Pitney Bowes subsidiary , had produced a working model of a `` picocassette '' recorder . </s>
<s> By 1982 , however , the patent status of the Lanier microcassette had changed , permitting Dictaphone to develop its own competitive micro system , which it did . </s>
<s> Marketing and sales departments then urged abandonment of the pico project . </s>
<s> But others said pico should proceed . </s>
<s> Both were right . </s>
<s> Dictaphone went ahead and introduced the pico in 1985 , but it has n't sold well . </s>
<s> To date , says Emil Jachmann , a Dictaphone vice president , it has `` broken even or shown a small loss . '' </s>
<s> Nevertheless , the device has been successful in other ways . </s>
<s> It helped Dictaphone attract better engineers , and it provided new technology for other company products . </s>
<s> The picocassette recorder also helped transform the company 's reputation from follower to leading-edge innovator . </s>
<s> `` It gave me great pride to see the inventor of the microcassette in Japan look at the pico and shake his head and say ` unbelievable , ' '' says Mr. Jachmann . </s>
<s> Dictaphone 's picocassette recorder is one of 13 case studies in the TRIAD Design Project , sponsored by the Design Management Institute of Boston and Harvard Business School . </s>
<s> The studies are on exhibit at Harvard this month and will travel to Chicago 's Institute of Design and the University of California at Berkeley . </s>
<s> A Rake 's Progress Means Branching Out </s>
<s> ONE DAY Carl Barrett of Mobile , Ala. , was raking some sycamore leaves , but the rake kept riding up over the piles . </s>
<s> The harder he tried to push them into large piles , the closer he came to breaking the rake and straining his back . </s>
<s> So Mr. Barrett , then vice president of the Alabama Steamship Association , took a steel-toothed garden rake and taped it to the underside of a leaf rake about nine inches up . </s>
<s> His crude device worked : The lower teeth gathered the leaves into a pile , while the higher , harder teeth moved the top of the pile . </s>
<s> Now incorporated into a polypropylene rake , the four-inch prongs , or `` wonderbars , '' also are supposed to aid in picking up leaves . </s>
<s> One customer , Donald Blaggs of Mobile , says the Barrett Rake allowed him to do his lawn in 2 1\/2 hours , two hours less than usual . </s>
<s> But other rake makers have their doubts . </s>
<s> Richard Mason , president of Ames Co. in Parkersburg , W. Va. , says the Barrett rake `` makes sense , '' but it would be `` tough '' to explain to consumers . </s>
<s> John Stoner , marketing director for True Temper Corp. , a subsidiary of Black & Decker , says people do n't want to move a leaf pile . </s>
<s> `` They either pick it up , '' he says , `` or they start pulling from a fresh direction . '' </s>
<s> Odds and Ends </s>
<s> NO MORE STUBBED toes or bruised shins , promises Geste Corp. of Goshen , Ind. , the designer of a bed support to replace traditional frames . </s>
<s> Four tubular steel `` Bedfellows , '' each roughly in the shape of a `` W , '' are attached to the bottom of the box spring in a recessed position ... . </s>
<s> Nearly half of U.S. consumers say they 'll pay up to 5 % more for packaging that can be recycled or is biodegradable , according to a survey commissioned by the Michael Peters Group , a design consultant . </s>
