<s> The turmoil on Wall Street may benefit some retailers attempting to lead leveraged buy-outs of their specialty and department-store chains , investment bankers and retailers said . </s>
<s> Managers at five chains have said in recent weeks that they intend to bid for their companies . </s>
<s> The chains include Bloomingdale 's , owned by Campeau Corp. , Toronto ; Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field 's , owned by B.A.T Industries PLC , London ; and B. Altman & Co. and Sakowitz Inc. , owned by Hooker Corp. , which is now being managed by a court-appointed provisional liquidator . </s>
<s> Hooker is based in Sydney , Australia . </s>
<s> The combination of so many chains available for sale , the recent failures of such retailing LBO 's as Miller & Rhoads Inc. and declining investor confidence will drive down prices , retailing observers said . </s>
<s> `` The pricing will become more realistic , which should help management , '' said Bruce Rosenthal , a New York investment banker with Nathan S. Jonas & Co . </s>
<s> `` Investors are n't going to be throwing money at any of the proposed LBOs , but doing deals on the basis of ridiculous assumptions never made sense , either . '' </s>
<s> Earlier this year , bankers and other investors were willing to provide financing because they assumed there would be major gains in both profitability and sales , Mr. Rosenthal added . </s>
<s> Those days are over now , he believes . </s>
<s> `` Competition from third parties who have cash and are prepared to buy has always existed and will continue , '' added Mr. Rosenthal . </s>
<s> `` But when prices were crazy , it was even harder to do an LBO . </s>
<s> Bankers believed in the greater-fool theory that says somebody else is always willing to pay more . </s>
<s> This is no longer true today . '' </s>
<s> At Saks Fifth Avenue , Paul Leblang , senior vice president , marketing , agreed that lower prices will help his management team in their proposed LBO . </s>
<s> `` Having to take on less debt would certainly be an advantage , '' said Mr. Leblang . </s>
<s> `` It would also help us in our search for equity partners . </s>
<s> To make an LBO work , now we are going to need more than just junk bonds . </s>
<s> '' None believe the proposed management LBOs will be easy to complete , especially at B. Altman & Co. , which is under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection . </s>
<s> Not only could the Wall Street gyrations damp Christmas sales if consumers lose confidence in the economy , but potential junk-bond buyers are sure to demand even stronger covenants and greater management equity participation . </s>
<s> Further , many institutions today holding troubled retailers ' debt securities will be reticent to consider additional retailing investments . </s>
<s> `` It 's called bad money driving out good money , '' said one retailing observer . </s>
<s> `` Institutions that usually buy retail paper have to be more concerned . '' </s>
<s> However , the lower prices these retail chains are now expected to bring should make it easier for managers to raise the necessary capital and pay back the resulting debt . </s>
<s> In addition , the fall selling season has generally been a good one , especially for those retailers dependent on apparel sales for the majority of their revenues . </s>
<s> `` What 's encouraging about this is that retail chains will be sold on the basis of their sales and earnings , not liquidation values , '' said Joseph E. Brooks , chairman and chief executive officer of Ann Taylor Inc. , a specialty chain . </s>
<s> `` Retailers who had good track records of producing profits will have a better chance to buy back their companies . '' </s>
<s> Still , most retailing observers expect that all the proposed retailing LBOs will depend partly on the sale of junk bonds , a market already in tumult , in part because of concerns associated with bonds issued by the Federated and Allied units of Campeau . </s>
<s> `` Prices for retail chains are lower today than they were last week , which will help management , '' said Gilbert Harrison , chairman of Financo Inc. , an investment-banking firm specializing in retailing acquisitions . </s>
<s> `` But the hurdle of financing still has to be resolved . </s>
<s> Potential bondholders will either look for greater equity participation on behalf of management , or insist the equity component of the deals be substantially greater than in the past . </s>
