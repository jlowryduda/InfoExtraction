<s> No strikeout , but certainly no home run . </s>
<s> That 's how the stock-picking game is shaping up for the months ahead , according to money managers and a few brokers . </s>
<s> Yesterday 's 88-point recovery from Friday 's megadrop in the Dow Jones industrials had many brokerage houses proclaiming that stocks are a good bargain again . </s>
<s> But quite a few money managers are n't buying it . </s>
<s> Weakening corporate earnings , they say , are no prescription for a bull market . </s>
<s> `` The stock market ai n't going to do much of anything '' for a while , says John Neff of Wellington Management , who runs the $ 8.3 billion Windsor Fund . </s>
<s> He suspects that Friday 's market decline may have a second leg , perhaps a 10 % to 15 % drop later on . </s>
<s> Mr. Neff says the stock market has lost some powerful driving forces , namely earnings growth and the `` LBO sweepstakes '' -- buy-out fever that induced investors to bid up whole groups of stocks , such as media and airlines . </s>
<s> After sitting with 20 % of his fund in cash before Friday 's sell-off , Mr. Neff says he bought `` a narrow list of stocks '' yesterday . </s>
<s> With flat corporate profits on the horizon for 1990 , money managers say price-earnings multiples that look cheap today might go on being cheap for a long time . </s>
<s> `` This is not a grossly overvalued market , but it 's not cheap either , '' says George Collins , president of the mutual fund company T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore . </s>
<s> According to Institutional Brokers Estimate System , Wall Street market strategists see only a 2.4 % jump in company profits in 1990 -- unlike in 1987 , when profits a year out looked good -LRB- they did soar 36 % in 1988 -RRB- . </s>
<s> Bulls say the market is an incredible bargain , priced at only about 12 times estimated 1989 earnings for stocks in the Standard & Poor 's 500 index . </s>
<s> Before the 1987 crash , the P\/E was more than 20 . </s>
<s> The common view , says Abby Cohen , strategist for Drexel Burnham Lambert , is that there will be `` mild economic growth , modest profit expansion , and things are going to be hunky-dory . </s>
<s> Our view is that we may see a profit decline . '' </s>
<s> Some think investors should sell into rallies . </s>
<s> The market `` is going to wind down , '' says Gerald W. Perritt , a Chicago money manager . </s>
<s> `` Things are a little less overpriced '' after Friday 's jolt in the market . </s>
<s> He expects stocks to decline an additional 5 % to 30 % , with the Dow perhaps bottoming out between 2000 and 2100 `` between now and June . '' </s>
<s> After Friday 's decline , Mr. Perritt 's firm ran statistical tests on 100 high-quality stocks , using old-fashioned value criteria devised by Benjamin Graham , an analyst and author in the 1930s and 1940s who is widely considered to be the father of modern securities analysis . </s>
<s> He found 85 still overvalued and 15 fairly valued . </s>
<s> Nicholas Parks , a New York money manager , expects the market to decline about 15 % . </s>
<s> `` I 've been two-thirds in cash since July , and I continue to think that having a defensive position is appropriate , '' he says . </s>
<s> Companies that piled on debt in leveraged buy-outs during the past two years `` will continue to surface as business problems . '' </s>
<s> `` Generalizations about value are n't useful , '' says New York money manager John LeFrere of Delta Capital Management . </s>
<s> For instance , he says , International Business Machines and Unisys might look cheap , but investors might continue to do better with stocks like Walt Disney , Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola , strong performers in recent years . </s>
<s> Money manager Robert Ross , head of Duncan Ross Associates Ltd. in Vancouver , British Columbia , says stocks would have to fall 15 % to 20 % before they are competitive with less risky investment alternatives . </s>
<s> Fredric Russell , a money manager in Tulsa , Okla. , says Friday 's cave-in `` is going to have more of a permanent impact on the psyche of many investors than Wall Street would want to admit . '' </s>
<s> There are still bulls out there . </s>
<s> `` I still think we will have a 3000 Dow , whether it 's six months or 12 months from now I do n't know , '' says David Dreman , managing partner of Dreman Value Management in New York . </s>
<s> `` We 're doing a little buying '' in some stocks `` that have really been smashed down . '' </s>
<s> Many brokerage house officials also are optimistic . </s>
<s> Yesterday , Goldman Sachs , Merrill Lynch and Dean Witter all increased the proportion of assets they recommend investors commit to stocks . </s>
<s> Dean Witter now recommends 85 % , Goldman 65 % and Merrill Lynch 50 % . </s>
<s> Some investors say Friday 's sell-off was a good thing , because it deflated a lot of crazy takeover speculation . </s>
<s> `` It was a healthy cleansing , '' says Michael Holland , who runs Salomon Brothers Asset Management in New York . </s>
<s> From here out , these investors see a return to old-fashioned investing , based on a company 's ability to show profit growth . </s>
<s> `` The fundamentals are pretty strong , '' Mr. Dreman says . </s>
<s> `` I do n't see this as a bear market at all . </s>
<s> It 's a recognition that there was much too much fluff in the LBO market . '' </s>
<s> Friday 's big fall was `` just a blunder by the stock market , '' says John Connolly , chief strategist for Dean Witter . </s>
<s> `` It was an overreaction to an event -LCB- the failure of a management and union group to get bank financing for a takeover of UAL -RCB- that does n't mean that much to lots of stocks . '' </s>
<s> Many investors have nagging worries , however . </s>
<s> Newspapers are full of headlines about companies defaulting on their debts and banks writing off real estate loans . </s>
<s> That hurts investors ' confidence in the economy and stocks . </s>
<s> Not even all the brokerage firms see clear sailing ahead . </s>
<s> `` Disappointing profits are likely to get worse in the next two quarters , '' says Mary Farrell , a market strategist at PaineWebber . </s>
<s> She thinks the market could drop about 10 % in the next few months , then recover and go higher . </s>
<s> Companies with steady earnings growth could do well , she says , while others with high debt or poor earnings could see their shares decline far more than 10 % . </s>
