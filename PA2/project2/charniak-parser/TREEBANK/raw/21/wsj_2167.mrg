<s> Houston attorney Dale Friend , representing a plaintiff in a damage suit , says he has negotiated a settlement that will strike a blow for his client . </s>
<s> Literally . </s>
<s> It turns out Mr. Friend 's client , Machelle Parks of Cincinnati , did n't like the way defense attorney Tom Alexander acted during the legal proceedings . </s>
<s> So she has agreed to forgo monetary damages against Mr. Alexander 's client in return for the right to punch the attorney . </s>
<s> Ms. Parks 's mother also gets to cuff Mr. Alexander . </s>
<s> So does Mr. Friend and his law partner , Nick Nichols . </s>
<s> The bizarre arrangement grows out of Mr. Alexander 's representation of Derr Construction Co. , one of several defendants in a wrongful death lawsuit brought by Ms. Parks , the widow of a construction worker killed in January 1987 while working on a new Houston convention center . </s>
<s> Last month , Mr. Friend says , Mr. Alexander 's associate agreed that Derr would pay $ 50,000 as part of an overall settlement . </s>
<s> But Mr. Alexander scuttled the deal at the last minute , angering the plaintiff 's side . </s>
<s> `` I never agreed to it , '' Mr. Alexander says , adding that `` it 's not necessary to pay these nuisance settlements . '' </s>
<s> When Ms. Parks and her mother heard about what had happened , Mr. Friend says , they volunteered that they would like to give Mr. Alexander a good walloping . </s>
<s> Mr. Friend says he passed that along to his adversary , and soon they were talking about the ground rules under which Derr could keep its money and the plaintiffs could take a shot at Mr. Alexander . </s>
<s> Although time and place have yet to be determined , some details are in place . </s>
<s> Mr. Friend says he agreed to strike Mr. Alexander above the belt . </s>
<s> Ms. Parks and her mother indicated they want to `` catch him unawares from behind , '' he says . </s>
<s> Mr. Alexander , for his part , insisted that the punchers ca n't assign their pummeling rights to anyone else , ca n't use a blunt instrument and ca n't take a running start . </s>
<s> Mr. Alexander says he regards the agreement , which has n't been submitted to a judge , as something of a joke . </s>
<s> However , he acknowledges they `` have the option of taking a swat at me if they really want to . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Friend says his side is `` dead serious . '' </s>
<s> Although they do n't contemplate delivering any disabling blows , he says that Mr. Alexander will be asked to sign a release from liability , just in case . </s>
