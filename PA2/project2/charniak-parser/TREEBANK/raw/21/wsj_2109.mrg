<s> National Geographic , the sixth-largest U.S. magazine , is attracting more readers than ever and offers the glossy , high-toned pages that upscale advertisers love . </s>
<s> So why did advertising pages plunge by almost 10 % and ad revenue by 7.2 % in the first half ? </s>
<s> To hear advertisers tell it , the magazine just has n't kept up with the times . </s>
<s> Despite renewed interest by the public in such topics as the environment and the Third World , it has n't been able to shake its reputation as a magazine boys like to flip through in search of topless tribe women . </s>
<s> Worse , it lagged behind competitors in offering now-standard gimmicks , from regional editions to discounts for frequent advertisers . </s>
<s> But now , the magazine is attempting to fight back , with an ambitious plan including a revamped sales strategy and a surprisingly aggressive ad campaign . </s>
<s> Advertisers do n't think of the magazine first , says Joan McCraw , who joined in April as national advertising director . </s>
<s> `` What we want to do is take a more aggressive stance . </s>
<s> People did n't believe we were in tune with the marketplace , and in many ways we were n't . '' </s>
<s> The 101-year-old magazine has never had to woo advertisers with quite so much fervor before . </s>
<s> It largely rested on its hard-to-fault demographics : 10.8 million subscribers in the first half , up from 10.5 million a year ago ; an average age of 42 for readers -- at the height of their consuming years ; loyalty to the tune of an 85 % average subscription renewal rate . </s>
<s> The magazine had its best year yet in 1988 , when it celebrated its centennial and racked up a 17 % gain in ad pages , to 283 . </s>
<s> But this year , when the hullabaloo surrounding its centennial died , so too did some advertiser interest . </s>
<s> The reason , ad executives say , is that the entire magazine business has been soft -- and National Geographic has some quirks that make it especially unattractive during a soft market . </s>
<s> Perhaps the biggest of those factors is its high ad prices -- $ 130,000 for a four-color page , vs. $ 47,000 for the Smithsonian , a comparable publication with a far smaller circulation . </s>
<s> When ad dollars are tight , the high page cost is a major deterrent for advertisers , who generally want to appear regularly in a publication or not at all . </s>
<s> Even though National Geographic offers far more readers than does a magazine like Smithsonian , `` the page costs you an arm and a leg to develop any frequency , '' says Harry Glass , New York media manager for Bozell Inc . </s>
<s> To combat that problem , National Geographic , like other magazines , began offering regional editions allowing advertisers to appear in only a portion of its magazines -- for example , ads can run only in the magazines sent to subscribers in the largest 25 markets . </s>
<s> But the magazine was slower than its competitors to come up with its regional editions , and until last year offered fewer of them than did competitors . </s>
<s> Time magazine , for example , has more than 100 separate editions going to different regions , top management , and other groups . </s>
<s> Another sticking point for advertisers was National Geographic 's tradition of lumping its ads together , usually at the beginning or end of the magazine , rather than spreading ads out among its articles , as most magazines do . </s>
<s> And National Geographic 's smaller-than-average size means extra production costs for advertisers . </s>
<s> But Ms. McCraw says the magazine is fighting back . </s>
<s> It now offers 30 regional editions , it very recently began running ads adjacent to articles , and it has been beefing up its sales force . </s>
<s> And it just launched a promotional campaign to tell chief executives , marketing directors , and media executives just that . </s>
<s> The centerpiece of the promotion is its new ad campaign , into which the magazine will pour about $ 500,000 , mostly in the next few weeks . </s>
<s> The campaign , created by Omnicom Group 's DDB Needham agency , takes advantage of the eye-catching photography that National Geographic is known for . </s>
<s> In one ad , a photo of the interior of the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris is paired with the headline , `` The only book more respected than ours does n't accept advertising . '' </s>
<s> Another ad pictures a tree ant , magnified 80 times , with the headline , `` For impact far beyond your size consider our regional editions . '' </s>
<s> Ms. McCraw says she wants the campaign to help attract advertisers in 10 categories , including corporate , financial services , consumer electronics , insurance and food . </s>
<s> Her goal : to top 300 ad pages in 1990 , up from about 274 this year . </s>
<s> Whether she can meet that ambitious goal is still far from certain . </s>
<s> `` The ad campaign is meant to contemporize the thought of National Geographic , '' she says . </s>
<s> `` We want it to be a '90s kind of image . '' </s>
<s> WCRS Plans Ad-Unit Sale </s>
<s> WCRS Group hopes to announce , perhaps today , an agreement to sell the majority of its ad unit to Paris-based Eurocom , a European ad executive said . </s>
<s> WCRS has been in discussions with Eurocom for several months . </s>
<s> However , when negotiations bogged down recently , WCRS 's chief executive , Peter Scott , met in Paris with another French firm , Boulet Dru Dupuy Petit , or BDDP . </s>
<s> According to the executive , BDDP 's involvement prompted renewed vigor in the WCRS-Eurocom talks and the two agencies were hoping to hammer out details by today . </s>
<s> Executives of the two agencies could n't be reached last night . </s>
<s> Ad Notes ... . </s>
<s> NEW ACCOUNT : Procter & Gamble Co. , Cincinnati , awarded the ad accounts for its line of Professional Crisco vegetable shortening and oil products to Northlich , Stolley , LaWarre , Cincinnati . </s>
<s> Billings were n't disclosed . </s>
<s> Professional Crisco products are specially made for the foodservice industry . </s>
<s> WHO 'S NEWS : Stephen Novick , 49 , was named executive vice president , deputy creative director at Grey Advertising , New York . </s>
