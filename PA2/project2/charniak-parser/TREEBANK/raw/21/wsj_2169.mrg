<s> The market for $ 200 billion of high-yield junk bonds regained some of its footing as the Dow Jones Industrial Average rebounded from Friday 's plunge . </s>
<s> But the junk recovery , led by the bellwether RJR Holdings bonds , was precarious . </s>
<s> No trading existed for the vast majority of junk bonds , securities industry officials said . </s>
<s> On Friday , trading in practically every issue ground to a halt as potential buyers fled and brokerage firms were unwilling to provide bid and offer prices for most issues . </s>
<s> `` Nothing traded on Friday , and people were n't really sure where the market should have opened '' yesterday , said Raymond Minella , co-head of merchant banking at Merrill Lynch & Co . </s>
<s> `` But we had a fairly active day yesterday . '' </s>
<s> At Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , the leading underwriter of junk bonds , `` I was prepared to be in a very bad mood tonight , '' said David Feinman , a junk bond trader . </s>
<s> `` Now , I feel maybe there 's a little bit of euphoria . '' </s>
<s> But before the stock market rebounded from a sharp early sell-off yesterday , he said , `` You could n't buy -LCB- junk bonds -RCB- and you could n't give them away . '' </s>
<s> Yesterday 's rally was led by RJR Holdings 13 3\/4 % bonds , which initially tumbled three points , or $ 30 for each $ 1,000 face amount , to 96 1\/4 before rebounding to 99 3\/4 . </s>
<s> Bonds issued by Kroger , Duracell , Safeway and American Standard also showed big gains , recovering almost all their losses from Friday and early yesterday . </s>
<s> But traders said the junk bond market increasingly is separating into a top-tier group , in which trades can be executed easily , and a larger group of lower-quality bonds in which liquidity -- or the ability to trade without too much difficulty -- has steadily deteriorated this year . </s>
<s> `` Liquidity has n't returned to the vast middle ground of the market , '' said Mr. Minella of Merrill . </s>
<s> `` The deadbeats are still deadbeats , '' said Mr. Feinman of Drexel . </s>
<s> Analysts are concerned that much of the high-yield market will remain treacherous for investors . </s>
<s> Paul Asquith , associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Sloan School of Management , citing a pattern of junk-bond default rates that are low in the early years after issuance and rise later , says , `` We 're now in a period where we 're starting to see defaults from the big issue years of 1984 to 1986 . '' </s>
<s> Mark Bachmann , a senior vice president at Standard & Poor 's Corp. , confirms that there is `` increasing concern about the future liquidity of the junk bond market . '' </s>
<s> `` Junk bonds are a highly stratified market , '' said Lewis Glucksman , vice chairman of Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co . </s>
<s> `` There 's a whole bunch of stuff that 's money good and a whole bunch of stuff that 's not so good . '' </s>
<s> Analysts at Standard & Poor 's say junk bond offerings by `` tightly stretched '' issuers seem to be growing . </s>
<s> Almost $ 8 billion of junk bonds that are considered untradeable include issues from SCI TV , Gillette Holdings -LRB- not related to Gillette Co. -RRB- , Interco , Seaman Furniture , Allied Stores , Federated Department Stores , National Gypsum , M.D.C. Holdings , Micropolis , Leaseway Transportation and Price Communications . </s>
<s> `` You could still have some very bad times ahead , '' said Mr. Bachmann . </s>
<s> `` It 's possible to have a 10 % default rate in one year , because we 're already seeing big problems in the midst of a pretty strong economy . </s>
<s> I 'm certainly not comfortable saying we 've seen the bottom . '' </s>
<s> But yesterday 's rally among `` good '' junk was a badly needed tonic for the market . </s>
<s> Many issues `` bounced off the floor , '' Mr. Minella said , and benchmark junk issues `` recovered all of their losses '' from Friday and early yesterday . </s>
<s> In contrast , he says , `` The stock market gained back only about half what it lost Friday , and the -LCB- government -RCB- bond market lost about half what it gained Friday . '' </s>
<s> Traders said yesterday 's rally was fueled by insurance companies looking for bargains after a drastic slide in prices the past month . </s>
<s> In addition , mutual funds did n't appear to be major sellers of high-yield securities as was expected . </s>
<s> `` Sometimes a shakeout is healthy , '' said Drexel 's Mr. Feinman . </s>
<s> `` People will learn to be more circumspect . </s>
<s> If they do good credit analysis , they will avoid the hand grenades . </s>
<s> I think the market is in good shape . </s>
