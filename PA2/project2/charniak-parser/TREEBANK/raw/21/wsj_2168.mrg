<s> After two years of drought , it rained money in the stock-index futures markets yesterday . </s>
<s> As financial markets rebounded , trading volume in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange 's huge Standard & Poor 's 500 stock-index futures pit soared , reaching near-record levels for the first time since October 1987 . </s>
<s> The sudden influx of liquidity enabled several traders to reap six-figure windfalls in a matter of minutes as prices soared , traders said . </s>
<s> `` Guys were minting money in there today , '' said John Legittino , a futures broker for Elders Futures Inc. in Chicago . </s>
<s> The S&P 500 futures contract , which moves in fractions of an index point under normal conditions , jumped two to three points in seconds early yesterday after an initial downturn , then moved strongly higher the rest of the day . </s>
<s> Each index point represents a $ 500 profit for each S&P 500 contract held . </s>
<s> For the first time since the 1987 crash , traders said that they were able to trade several hundred S&P 500 contracts at a time in a highly liquid market . </s>
<s> Many institutions and individual investors have shied away from stock-index futures , blaming them for speeding the stock market crash on Black Monday two years ago . </s>
<s> Since the crash , many futures traders have n't assumed large positions for fear that the S&P 500 market , with much of its customer order flow missing , would dry up if prices turned against them . </s>
<s> More than 400 traders jammed the S&P 500 futures pit to await the opening bell . </s>
<s> Traders were shouting bids and offers a full five minutes before the start of trading at 8:30 am </s>
<s> The contract fell five points at the open to 323.85 , the maximum opening move allowed under safeguards adopted by the Merc to stem a market slide . </s>
<s> But several traders quickly stepped up and bid for contracts , driving prices sharply higher . </s>
<s> The market hovered near Friday 's closing price of 328.85 for about a half hour , moving several index points higher or lower in seconds , then broke higher and did n't look back . </s>
<s> The S&P 500 contract that expires in December closed up a record 15.65 points on volume of nearly 80,000 contracts . </s>
<s> `` Traders five feet from each other were making bids and offers that were a full point apart , '' said one S&P 500 broker . </s>
<s> `` You could buy at the bid and sell at the offer and make a fortune , '' he marveled . </s>
<s> Several of Wall Street 's largest securities firms , including Salomon Brothers Inc. and PaineWebber Inc. , were also large buyers , traders said . </s>
<s> Salomon Brothers was among the largest sellers of stock-index futures last week , traders said . </s>
<s> Brokerage firms as a rule do n't comment on their market activity . </s>
<s> Unlike the week following Black Monday two years ago , individual traders in the S&P 500 pit were also being uncharacteristically circumspect about their one-day profits . </s>
<s> `` With the FBI around here , bragging rights are a thing of the past , '' said one trader , referring to the federal investigation of futures trading that so far has resulted in 46 indictments lodged against individuals on the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade . </s>
