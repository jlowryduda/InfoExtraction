<s> The metal and marble lobby of CenTrust Bank 's headquarters is grander than your average savings and loan . </s>
<s> For one thing , there is an old master on the wall -- `` Samuel Anointing David , '' a big baroque canvas painted by Mattia Preti , a 17th-century Neapolitan . </s>
<s> At the moment , however , the painting is a nagging reminder of the problems that have engulfed CenTrust and its flamboyant chairman and chief executive , David L. Paul . </s>
<s> In an international buying spree that began barely two years ago , Mr. Paul amassed a collection of about 30 pre-18th-century works , including the Preti , at a total cost of $ 28 million . </s>
<s> By midnight Oct. 6 , all of the paintings were supposed to have been sold off , under orders from Florida 's comptroller , whose office regulates the state 's S&Ls . </s>
<s> CenTrust did n't meet the deadline . </s>
<s> The collection was at the heart of a grandiose plan Mr. Paul had in which the art was to do double duty -- as an investment for CenTrust and as decoration for the S&L 's new office tower , designed by I.M. Pei . </s>
<s> The rub is that the $ 28 million was plucked from the funds of this federally insured institution even as CenTrust was losing money hand over fist . </s>
<s> Mr. Paul had no right to buy art for the S&L in the first place -- it is n't on the comptroller 's `` permissible '' list -- without seeking a special dispensation , which he did not do . </s>
<s> Besides that , some of the paintings that were to grace the walls of CenTrust actually ended up hanging in the chairman 's estate on La Gorce Isle off Miami Beach . </s>
<s> Last spring , the comptroller 's office called a halt to Mr. Paul 's fling , giving him six months to sell the paintings . </s>
<s> The acquisitions , officials said in a letter to Mr. Paul , were `` unsafe , unsound and unauthorized . '' </s>
<s> So far , Mr. Paul has unloaded but three of his masterpieces , he wo n't say to whom . </s>
<s> The comptroller 's office says it is `` monitoring the situation . '' </s>
<s> Though the agency could remove Mr. Paul , it has no current intention to do that . </s>
<s> `` It 's not like selling Chevrolets , '' Mr. Paul says , as he takes a drag on a goldbanded St. Moritz cigarette . </s>
<s> `` The last six months has established the quality of the collection . </s>
<s> There 's no fire sale here . '' </s>
<s> Despite Mr. Paul 's characteristic hauteur , the 50-year-old , chain-smoking dynamo is finding that getting CenTrust -- Florida 's largest thrift institution -- out of its riskiest investments is much tougher than getting into them had been . </s>
<s> Paintings are just part of the picture . </s>
<s> Although Mr. Paul has pared a $ 1.35 billion junk-bond portfolio to less than $ 900 million since April , the high-yield debt market has plummeted . </s>
<s> Divesting itself of what is left , as is required of all thrift institutions by July 1994 under the new federal S&L bailout law , may well prove difficult . </s>
<s> And CenTrust has other problems . </s>
<s> Late last week federal regulators ordered the thrift institution to stop paying dividends on its preferred stock -- a move that suggests deep concern about an institution . </s>
<s> Mr. Paul has a plan to bring in $ 150 million by selling off 63 of CenTrust 's 71 branches , but it has yet to be approved by regulators . </s>
<s> It is Mr. Paul 's art venture , however , that has drawn the most attention from investors and regulators , not to mention galleries throughout the world . </s>
<s> Embittered shareholders -LRB- some of whom are suing -RRB- say the chairman and his collection epitomize the excesses of speculation that set off the national S&L crisis . </s>
<s> -LRB- CenTrust shares have fallen sharply in price from a high of $ 15.125 in 1986 to close yesterday at $ 2.875 . -RRB- </s>
<s> Gallery directors , meanwhile , say Mr. Paul and others of his ilk have left an indelible mark on the art world -- and not for the better . </s>
<s> Collectors do n't say `` It 's a van Gogh '' anymore , laments Harry Brooks , the president of Wildenstein & Co. , a New York gallery . </s>
<s> `` They say , ` Johnny Payson got $ 53 million for his , so certainly $ 10 million is n't too much for mine . ' </s>
<s> The great collectors we depended on , such as Paul Mellon or Norton Simon , have stopped buying , and the new buyers are brilliant men who made money in the stock market or in takeovers and rushed into collecting ... . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Payson , an art dealer and collector , sold Vincent van Gogh 's `` Irises '' at a Sotheby 's auction in November 1987 to Australian businessman Alan Bond . </s>
<s> -LRB- Trouble is , Mr. Bond has yet to pay up , and until he does , Sotheby 's has the painting under lock and key . -RRB- </s>
<s> When Mr. Paul moved in on the art market , he let it be known that virtually no piece was too costly to be considered by CenTrust . </s>
<s> He established his reputation as a freespender in January last year at Sotheby 's auction of the Linda and Gerald Guterman collection in New York . </s>
<s> There , on one of his first shopping trips , Mr. Paul picked up several paintings at stunning prices . </s>
<s> He paid $ 2.2 million , for instance , for a still life by Jan Jansz. den Uyl that was expected to fetch perhaps $ 700,000 . </s>
<s> The price paid was a record for the artist . </s>
<s> -LRB- Some 64 % of items offered at the Guterman auction were sold , at an average price of $ 343,333 . </s>
<s> The rest were withdrawn for lack of acceptable bids . -RRB- </s>
<s> Afterward , Mr. Paul is said by Mr. Guterman to have phoned Mr. Guterman , the New York developer selling the collection , and gloated . </s>
<s> `` He says he ` stole them , ' '' recalls Mr. Guterman . </s>
<s> `` And he tells me , ` If you want to see your paintings , you 'll have to come to my house in Florida . ' '' </s>
<s> Mr. Paul denies phoning and gloating . </s>
<s> `` It 's just not true , '' he says . </s>
<s> Mr. Paul quickly became more aggressive in his collecting , with the help of George Wachter , a Sotheby 's expert in old masters whom he met at an exhibition of the Guterman items . </s>
<s> Mr. Wachter , who became his principal adviser , searched galleries in London , Paris and Monaco . </s>
<s> And , according to one dealer , Mr. Wachter had a penchant for introducing Mr. Paul with the phrase : `` He can buy anything . '' </s>
<s> Nicholas Hall , the president of the Colnaghi U.S.A. Ltd. gallery in New York , sold Mr. Paul `` Abraham and Sarah in the Wilderness '' by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo . </s>
<s> Mr. Hall says Mr. Paul `` was known to spend a lot of money . </s>
<s> People were interested in seeing him , but it was recognized that the route was through Sotheby 's and particularly George Wachter . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Paul thus developed a close , symbiotic relationship with Sotheby 's . </s>
<s> Mr. Paul was eager to assemble a collection for the headquarters CenTrust has been moving into for the greater part of a year . </s>
<s> Sotheby 's , the auction house founded in London 1744 and now under the umbrella of Sotheby 's Holdings Inc. , was hoping to stir up interest in old masters as it strove to build its U.S. business . </s>
<s> European dealers continued to dominate the action in old masters , which Sotheby 's North America had lately been touting in this country . </s>
<s> For several months , there was optimism all around . </s>
<s> Last October , Mr. Paul paid out $ 12 million of CenTrust 's cash -- plus a $ 1.2 million commission -- for `` Portrait of a Man as Mars . '' </s>
<s> The painting , attributed to Flemish artist Peter Paul Rubens , was purchased privately through Sotheby 's , not at auction . </s>
<s> In March 1989 , just 15 months into his campaign , Mr. Paul was named by Art & Antiques magazine as one of the top 100 individual collectors in the U.S. . </s>
<s> `` An unknown quantity to most of the art world , Paul is no stranger to lavish spending , '' the magazine said , noting that he does n't stop at paint on canvas but also spends big on art you can eat . </s>
<s> `` He recently bid $ 30,000 at a Paris charity auction for a dinner cooked by six of the world 's great chefs , but the final party cost closer to $ 100,000 . '' </s>
<s> -LRB- Mr. Paul says it was n't that high . -RRB- </s>
<s> The art collection might have come to rival the Medicis ' had the Florida comptroller 's office not got wind of Mr. Paul 's aesthetic adventure . </s>
<s> In its letter to him , dated March 2 and shared with reporters , Alex Hager , the chief of the thrift-institution bureau in the comptroller 's office , expressed puzzlement that the S&L could be so profligate when it had reported losses of more than $ 13 million in its two preceding quarters . </s>
<s> The state gave CenTrust 30 days to sell the Rubens . </s>
<s> The comptroller 's office eventually extended the deadline to six months but broadened its demands , ordering that the `` book value of the collection -LCB- be -RCB- reduced to zero . '' </s>
<s> In other words : Get rid of all the pictures . </s>
<s> The state obliquely noted that unsafe banking practices are grounds for removing an officer or director and closed with the admonition to Mr. Paul : `` Govern yourself accordingly . '' </s>
<s> The state agency was particularly vexed to learn that the Rubens and a half-dozen other paintings listed among the bank 's `` furniture and fixtures , '' were actually hanging in the chairman 's house . </s>
<s> Mr. Paul says that at one point he did indeed have eight or nine of the paintings at home and that the rest were in storage at Sotheby 's . </s>
<s> He explains that he was `` merely storing the paintings at home -- with some display -- because of the special dehumidified environment '' required for their safekeeping , until CenTrust 's new building was ready for them . </s>
<s> Still , the incident was embarrassing . </s>
<s> It came on the heels of a number of local newspaper articles suggesting that Mr. Paul has benefited handsomely from his association with CenTrust . </s>
<s> For instance , he got a $ 3 million loan from the S&L , negotiated at a below-market rate . </s>
<s> He owns 43 % of CenTrust 's shares . </s>
<s> Adding to Mr. Paul 's problems , dealers -LRB- some with vested interests -RRB- insist that he , relying rather too heavily on Sotheby 's advice , paid much too much for several pieces in the CenTrust collection . </s>
<s> The $ 12 million lavished on the Rubens , for example , was a record price for the artist and maybe twice its value , given a dispute among scholars about its provenance . </s>
<s> David Tunick , the president of David Tunick Inc. , a New York gallery , says scholars question the authenticity of the Rubens . </s>
<s> It may have been painted instead by a Rubens associate . </s>
<s> `` The feeling among many experts on the commercial side is that the price paid at the time was excessive in any event , '' Mr. Tunick says . </s>
<s> `` It sounds like with the Rubens he got absolutely taken to the cleaners . '' </s>
<s> Victor Wiener , the executive director of the Appraisers Association of America , agrees that Mr. Paul paid very dearly for the Rubens and adds that getting rid of it any time soon for a similar sum would be quite a feat . </s>
<s> `` It 's not beyond credibility the Rubens will someday be worth $ 12 million , but whether it could be sold for that amount tomorrow remains to be seen . '' </s>
<s> Still , predicting is tricky . </s>
<s> `` I 'm forever dumbfounded by what I see making these high prices . '' </s>
<s> Jonathan H. Kress , the son of the painting 's former owner , Mrs. Rush Kress , dismisses the price talk as `` sour grapes . '' </s>
<s> Dealers contemptuous of the purchase price , he says , were themselves interested in buying the Rubens but lost out . </s>
<s> Mr. Paul , for his part , defends the Rubens price , saying a lot of the experts have never seen the thing itself . </s>
<s> `` Most of them were n't even born the last time the painting was displayed publicly , '' he says . </s>
<s> Art prices are skyrocketing , but a good deal of legerdemain is involved in compiling statistics on sales . </s>
<s> Salomon Brothers Inc. , the investment-banking firm , in its annual tally of investment returns , reported that old masters appreciated 51 % in the year ended June 1 , the greatest return of any of 13 assets it tracked . </s>
<s> -LRB- Impressionist and modern paintings , not tracked by Salomon , are ranked even higher at 74 % by Sotheby 's . -RRB- </s>
<s> Salomon , moreover , gets its data on art appreciation from Sotheby 's , whose prices go up with clients like Mr. Paul in its thrall . </s>
<s> The percentages omit from consideration the many paintings that go begging at auction . </s>
<s> Art indexes track winners , not losers . </s>
<s> But art that has fallen sharply in value is rarely put up for sale . </s>
<s> Also , at any of Sotheby 's auctions of old masters , roughly one-third to one-fifth of what is offered does n't sell at any price . </s>
<s> It 's not that there are n't any bids , but the bids do n't meet the minimum `` reserve '' prices set by the sellers . </s>
<s> In January , the Preti painting that now hangs at CenTrust was expected to bring no more than $ 700,000 at auction until Mr. Paul came along with his $ 1.15 million . </s>
<s> Mr. Hall of the Colnaghi gallery says $ 1.15 million `` would have been an impossible price for anyone to ask for a Preti four years ago . '' </s>
<s> But from his vantage point , it is n't that Mr. Paul , a customer of his too , overpaid for the work , `` a gargantuan painting by an artist who is not a household word . '' </s>
<s> -LRB- The painting is 10 feet wide , seven feet high . -RRB- </s>
<s> Rather , `` It just shows things have changed . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Paul boasts that he spotted bargains in old masters just before they took an upward turn . </s>
<s> `` They went up 51 % last year , and they 'll do it again this year , '' he declares . </s>
<s> `` They were a sleeper . </s>
<s> Everybody was out buying Monets . '' </s>
<s> Sotheby 's vice president Diana Levitt says the auction house has been `` assisting '' Mr. Paul in selling the paintings . </s>
<s> And while Sotheby 's chief rivals in the art world , private art dealers , `` wo n't be happy to hear it , '' she adds , `` a number of -LCB- the artworks -RCB- have already been sold , and at a substantial profit . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Paul claims to have sold three paintings , at more than a 10 % profit . </s>
<s> That is n't 51 % , and the claim is n't documented . </s>
<s> He furthermore denies that he relied too heavily on Sotheby 's or Mr. Wachter . </s>
<s> Mr. Paul says he had not one but four advisers and that he never bid impulsively . </s>
<s> After all , he had the counsel of `` curators from the most reputable museums in the world . '' </s>
<s> He says he expects to sell the collection -- including the controversial Rubens -- `` carefully and prudently , just as it was put together . '' </s>
<s> But in art-world parlance , Mr. Paul 's holdings are `` burnt . '' </s>
<s> That is , he is being compelled to put them on the market too soon , and has already gotten offers that are less than he paid for some of the art works . </s>
<s> `` After a few years , you can argue there has been natural appreciation , '' says Susan Theran , the publisher of Leonard 's Annual Price Index of Art Auctions . </s>
<s> But quick turnover in artwork is `` like pawning your jewelry -- you end up with 50 % . </s>
<s> People hold out and try to get a bargain . '' </s>
<s> Sotheby 's defends itself and Mr. Paul in the matter . </s>
<s> Mr. Wachter says Mr. Paul was a quick study who worked intensely and bought the best pictures available at the moment . </s>
<s> `` On occasion , he paid a high price , '' Mr. Wachter concedes , but he says those who bid less and dropped out were dealers who would then have marked up the paintings to resell them at a profit to collectors . </s>
<s> Naomi Bernhard Levinson , a fine-arts appraiser at Bernhard Associates in San Francisco , considers it `` definite conflict of interest for an auction house to both advise a client on purchases and to set price estimates on the paintings to be purchased . '' </s>
<s> Sotheby 's , she says , is `` wearing both hats . '' </s>
<s> `` I ca n't see why there would be a conflict of interest , '' says Sotheby 's Ms. Levitt . </s>
<s> `` Estimates are based on the previous price of similar works sold at auction and current market conditions , and are not affected by any knowledge of who the potential buyer could be . '' </s>
<s> Frequently , clients express interest in paintings but do n't end up bidding , she adds , `` so we do n't know who the potential buyer will be . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Paul , in selling off his paintings , is seeking at least a 15 % return on the bank 's investment , so as to prove that the venture was sound . </s>
<s> Mr. Paul says that he has feelers out over much of the globe and that potential buyers from as far away as Japan and Italy have examined the collection . </s>
<s> Because of the pressure on CenTrust to sell , dealers and collectors have been trying to get the paintings at bargain-basement prices . </s>
<s> But so far , Mr. Paul and his advisers are holding fast . </s>
<s> One dealer , Martin Zimet of French & Co. in New York , says he `` would have loved to buy '' a Jan Davids de Heem painting from the bank . </s>
<s> `` I tried to steal the picture -- to buy it attractively -- and -LCB- Sotheby 's -RCB- would n't do it . </s>
<s> They were protecting his interests . '' </s>
<s> Meanwhile , Mr. Paul and CenTrust executives are getting squeamish about opulence . </s>
<s> Mr. Paul has been characterized as `` the Great Gatsby or something , '' complains Karen E. Brinkman , an executive vice president of CenTrust . </s>
<s> The media , she says , have distorted his personal life . </s>
<s> Mr. Paul nods in agreement . </s>
<s> `` I do n't think I have a life style that is , frankly , so flamboyant , '' he says . </s>
<s> But at just that moment , he is interrupted in his office by a servant in tuxedo who pours coffee from silver into a cup of china and dabs the brim with linen . </s>
<s> Mr. Paul says , yes , the ceiling in his executive suite is gold-leaf inlay . </s>
<s> The offices are done in hardwood and oriental rugs , leatherbound books and , of course , a $ 12 million Rubens . </s>
<s> But he implores that the splendor be played down . </s>
<s> `` Do n't say it 's a gold ceiling . </s>
<s> Just say the offices are tastefully appointed , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` Otherwise , the regulators will take it for decadence , and nowadays everything 's got to be pristine . '' </s>
<s> Figures do n't include taxes or transaction costs . </s>
