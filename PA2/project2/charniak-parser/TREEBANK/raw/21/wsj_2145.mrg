<s> The roller-coaster stock market is making life tougher for small companies trying to raise money . </s>
<s> In the wake of Friday 's plunge and yesterday 's rebound , some companies are already postponing deals , and others wish they could . </s>
<s> As in other jittery times , many small businesses expect a particularly rough time raising funds as investors shun risky deals , seeking safety in bigger companies . </s>
<s> Even if stock prices fully recover from Friday 's sharp decline , the unsettled conditions will frighten many investors . </s>
<s> `` The implication of an unsettled situation is that the thing could drop dramatically , '' says Henry Linsert Jr. , chairman of Martek Corp. , a four-year-old biotechnology company that is planning a private placement of stock . </s>
<s> `` The more variables that indicate risk , the more the investor is going to drive a hard bargain . '' </s>
<s> Earlier this month , Staples Inc. , a Newton , Mass. , office-supplies discounter , said it would accelerate expansion plans nationwide and offer more of its stock to the public . </s>
<s> At the time , its shares were selling above their initial offering price of $ 19 , and bankers believed Staples would sell new stock without a hitch . </s>
<s> But with the company 's shares standing at $ 15 yesterday , a new offering seems unlikely , company officials say . </s>
<s> Business , however , continues to be `` robust , '' and the stock market has n't affected the concern 's expansion plans , says Todd Krasnow , a senior executive . </s>
<s> Other companies figure they ca n't avoid the market . </s>
<s> `` We have capital requirements , '' says Mr. Linsert , `` so we have to go ahead '' with a planned $ 1.5 billion private placement . </s>
<s> Unless the market goes right back up , he says , `` it may take us six to nine months to find the money , instead of three . '' </s>
<s> And the Columbia , Md. , company may have to settle for a lower price , he adds . </s>
<s> Life is particularly nerve-racking for companies that had planned to go public this week . </s>
<s> Hand-holding is becoming an investment-banking job requirement . </s>
<s> Robertson , Stephens & Co. , a San Francisco investment banking concern , has a client that looked forward to making its initial public offering yesterday . </s>
<s> Officers of the company , a health-care concern , `` were very discouraged on Friday and felt they should n't go public ; we felt they should , '' says Sanford Robertson , partner in the banking concern . </s>
<s> As the market dropped Friday , Robertson Stephens slashed the value of the offering by 7 % . </s>
<s> Yesterday , when similar securities rebounded , it bumped the valuation up again . </s>
<s> As of late yesterday , the IPO was still on . </s>
<s> For many , the situation is especially discouraging because the market for IPOs was showing signs of strengthening after several years of weakness . </s>
<s> `` We were just beginning to look at the increase in IPOs , seeing the light at the end of the tunnel , '' says Frank Kline Jr. , partner in Lambda Funds , a Beverly Hills , Calif. , venture capital concern . </s>
<s> `` But the tunnel 's just gotten longer . '' </s>
<s> Companies planning to go public `` are definitely taking a second look , '' says Allen Hadhazy , senior analyst at the Institute for Econometric Research , Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , which publishes the New Issues newsletter on IPOs . </s>
<s> He calculates that the recent market slide translated into a 5 % to 7 % reduction in IPO proceeds to companies . </s>
<s> Many companies are hesitating . </s>
<s> Exabyte Corp. had been planning to sell 10 % of its stock this week in an IPO that would raise up to $ 28.5 million . </s>
<s> But now , Peter Behrendt , president , says , `` We 're making decisions on a day-to-day basis . '' </s>
<s> Debt-free and profitable , the Boulder , Colo. , computer-products concern could borrow funds if it decides against an IPO now , he says . </s>
<s> KnowledgeWare Inc. , an Atlanta computer-software concern , says it is still planning to go ahead with its IPO this week or next -- unless conditions change . </s>
<s> `` It 's a wait-and-see situation right now , '' says Terry McGowan , president . </s>
<s> Delayed financings also would affect the operations of many companies . </s>
<s> Sierra Tucson Cos. , a Tucson , Ariz. , operator of addiction-treatment centers , has a planned doubling of capacity riding on an IPO scheduled for next week . </s>
<s> William O'Donnell , president , says he still thinks the IPO will succeed . </s>
<s> If it does n't , he says , the company would have to change its expansion timetable . </s>
<s> But the market turmoil could be partially beneficial for some small businesses . </s>
<s> In a sagging market , the Federal Reserve System `` might flood the market with funds , and that should bring interest rates down , '' says Leonard T. Anctil , vice president of the Bank of New England , Boston . </s>
<s> James G. Zafris , president of Danvers Savings Bank , Danvers , Mass. , says the market turmoil `` is an absolute non-event for small business . '' </s>
<s> For small companies , he says , interest rates are far more important than what happens on stock exchanges . </s>
<s> Mr. Zafris thinks rates are heading down , helping small companies . </s>
<s> Peter Drake , biotechnology analyst for Vector Securities International , Chicago , thinks market uncertainty may encourage small companies to form more strategic alliances with big corporations . </s>
<s> Partly because the 1987 market crash made it harder for them to find financing , many high-technology concerns have made such alliances recently . </s>
<s> Some even see a silver lining in the dark clouds . </s>
<s> Alan Wells , president of Bollinger , Wells , Lett & Co. , a New York merger specialist , thinks panicky investors may lose their enthusiasm for leveraged buy-out and giant takeover deals . </s>
<s> Instead , they could turn to investing in smaller deals involving smaller companies , he says . </s>
<s> And William E. Wetzel Jr. , a University of New Hampshire management professor and director of Venture Capital Network Inc. , says the market 's gyrations will underline the investors ' lack of control in big stock investments . </s>
<s> This will add to the appeal of small business , he says , where investors often have a degree of influence . </s>
