<s> Korean car exports have slid about 40 % so far this year , but auto makers here are n't panicking . </s>
<s> They are enjoying domestic sales that are more than making up for lost overseas sales . </s>
<s> South Korean consumers are expected to buy almost 500,000 passenger cars this year , up 60 % from 1988 . </s>
<s> In fact , some auto executives suggest that slackened demand for their cars in the U.S. and Canada is a blessing ; otherwise they would n't be able to keep up with demand in the more profitable local market . </s>
<s> `` We are very lucky to easily change an export loss to domestic plus , '' says Hong Tu Pyo , managing director of domestic marketing for Hyundai Motor Co . </s>
<s> As it is , waiting lists of a month are n't unusual for popular models . </s>
<s> Demand is so strong that all of the domestic makers -- Hyundai , Kia Motors Corp. , Daewoo Motor Co. and even upstart SsangYong Motor Co. -- plan to build more factories . </s>
<s> Industry analysts predict that by 1995 , South Korea will be building three million cars a year -- about half of that for export . </s>
<s> It 's an optimistic move in a industry already facing world-wide overcapacity . </s>
<s> But South Korean auto makers are confident that the export market will bounce back and that demand in Korea will stay strong . </s>
<s> Currently only one in 38 South Koreans owns a car , up from one in 200 a decade ago . </s>
<s> `` In the year 2000 it will be one car per family . </s>
<s> At that point domestic sales will slow down , '' says Kim Yoon Kwon , director of marketing for Daewoo Motor . </s>
<s> The reason for the tremendous demand is simple : South Koreans suddenly have a lot more money . </s>
<s> `` We never thought we 'd own a car , '' says Kwang Ok Kyong , who just bought a Daewoo LeMans on a five-year loan . </s>
<s> She and her husband started a small printing business and need the car for work as well as for weekend jaunts . </s>
<s> Pay raises of 60 % over the past three years have given many South Koreans the money to enjoy the things they were supplying the rest of the world . </s>
<s> The success of newcomer SsangYong Motor shows the strength of the auto market and its growing diversity . </s>
<s> A part of the construction-oriented conglomerate SsangYong Group , it took over the dying Dong-A Motor Co. in 1986 . </s>
<s> SsangYong began making variations of the Jeep-like `` Korando '' vehicle . </s>
<s> -LRB- Dong-A had had a technology agreement with Jeep maker American Motors Corp. , now a part of Chrysler Corp . -RRB- </s>
<s> The most popular style is the stretched `` Family , '' which resembles a Ford Bronco or Chevy Blazer . </s>
<s> The four-wheel-drive vehicles start at $ 15,000 ; a Family can cost over $ 25,000 . </s>
<s> SsangYong , which has only about 3 % of the domestic market , will sell about 18,000 of its models this year , twice as many as last year . </s>
<s> It sees sales rising 45 % to 26,000 units next year . </s>
<s> The company plans to expand plant capacity 50 % by 1991 . </s>
<s> By then it also hopes to begin producing a passenger car based on the Volvo 240 and selling for about $ 20,000 . </s>
<s> Hyundai and Daewoo seem unconcerned about the SsangYong threat , but Kia , the scrappy No.3 auto maker , is selling four-wheel-drive vehicles through its Asia unit . </s>
<s> It plans to sell 1,700 units in 1989 . </s>
<s> Kia , the only Korean car maker that has seen its overseas sales grow in 1989 , aims at Korea 's common man . </s>
<s> Its advantage has been the peppy little Pride , sold as the Ford Festiva in the U.S. . </s>
<s> At 3.8 million won , or $ 5,700 , the econobox is the lowest-priced car in South Korea . </s>
<s> Along with two larger models , the company claims 18 % of the domestic market . </s>
<s> Ford Motor Co. and Japan 's Mazda Motor Corp. have equity interests in Kia . </s>
<s> Kia is the most aggressive of the Korean Big Three in offering financing . </s>
<s> Loans for as long as five years make the cars very accessible , with monthly payments as low as 80,000 won , or $ 120 . </s>
<s> Daewoo Motor , a 50-50 joint venture with General Motors Corp. and the Daewoo Group conglomerate , is the only auto maker that appears to be hurting . </s>
<s> Shipments of its Lemans to GM 's Pontiac division are off about 65 % from a year ago , versus a 44 % decline for Hyundai and an 18 % increase for Kia . </s>
<s> Moreover , Daewoo 's domestic sales have grown half as fast as sales of its rivals . </s>
<s> The big problem for Daewoo , which holds about 21 % of the market , is the long series of labor disruptions it suffered this year . </s>
<s> But Daewoo is expanding too . </s>
<s> In fact , a sister company , Daewoo Shipbuilding and Heavy Machinery , plans to build 240,000 minicars by the mid-1990s . </s>
<s> Hyundai , the Korean market leader with a 58 % share , also plans to jump into minicars at the same time . </s>
<s> It has a similar project for 200,000 cars a year . </s>
<s> Kia is reportedly also considering such a plan . </s>
<s> Even giant Samsung Group is rumored in the Korean press to be considering getting into the auto-making business ; a company spokesman had no comment . </s>
