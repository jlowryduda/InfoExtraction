<s> Once again , your editorial page misstates the law to conform to your almost beatific misperceptions . </s>
<s> In an excursus of little relevance to his central point about private enforcement suits by environmental groups , Michael S. Greve informs your readers , `` ... the Clean Water Act is written upon the presumption -- the pretense , rather -- that nothing but zero risk will do ; it establishes a legal standard of zero discharge '' -LRB- `` Congress's Environmental Buccaneers , '' Sept. 18 -RRB- . </s>
<s> This statement surely buttresses your editorial viewpoint that environmental protection is generally silly or excessive , but it is simply wrong . </s>
<s> The Clean Water Act contains no `` legal standard '' of zero discharge . </s>
<s> It requires that `` discharges of pollutants '' into the `` waters of the United States '' be authorized by permits that reflect the effluent limitations developed under section 301 . </s>
<s> Whatever may be the problems with this system , it scarcely reflects `` zero risk '' or `` zero discharge . '' </s>
<s> Perhaps Mr. Greve was confused by Congress 's meaningless statement of `` the national goal '' in section 101 , which indeed calls for the elimination of discharges -- by 1985 , no less . </s>
<s> This fatuous statement was not taken seriously when enacted in 1972 , and should not now be confused with the operative provisions of the statute . </s>
<s> Thus , you do the public a great disservice when Mr. Greve suggests , even facetiously , that the Clean Water Act prohibits the preparation of a scotch and water ; your tippling readers may be led to believe that nothing but chance or oversight protects them , as they cower in the night with their scotch and waters , from the hairyknuckled knock of the Sierra Club at their doors . </s>
