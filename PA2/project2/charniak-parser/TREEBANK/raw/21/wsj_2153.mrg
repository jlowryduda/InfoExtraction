<s> When Nucor Corp. begins shipping steel from the world 's first thin-slab plant this month , it will begin testing the competitive mettle of its giant competitors . </s>
<s> The new technology , which creates a very thin piece of steel , radically reduces the costs of making flat-rolled sheets . </s>
<s> An ebullient Kenneth Iverson , Nucor 's chairman , says the company 's plant eventually will make a ton of steel in 1.5 man hours , compared with four to six man hours at a conventional mill . </s>
<s> `` We 've had the Russians and Chinese , and people from India visiting us , '' Mr. Iverson beams . </s>
<s> `` Everyone in the world is watching us very closely . '' </s>
<s> Especially his neighbors , the major U.S. steelmakers . </s>
<s> Already , USX Corp. and Armco Inc. are studying Nucor 's technology to see if they can adopt it . </s>
<s> Says the chief executive officer of a major Midwest steel company : `` It 's damn worrisome . '' </s>
<s> The once-staid steel industry is about to be turned topsy-turvy by a 1990s technology revolution . </s>
<s> New , efficient and sophisticated processes make it easier for smaller , less cash-rich companies to make steel at a fraction of what Big Steel paid decades ago . </s>
<s> It also enables minimills finally to get a toehold in the flat-rolled steel market -- the major steelmakers ' largest , most prized , and until now , untouchable , market . </s>
<s> But such thin-slab technology is only the beginning . </s>
<s> Eager engineers espouse direct-steelmaking and direct casting , which by the end of the 1990s will enable production without coke ovens and blast furnaces . </s>
<s> Those massive structures , while posing cost and environmental headaches , effectively locked out all but deep-pocketed giants from steelmaking . </s>
<s> `` There 's a revolution ahead of us that will ultimately change the way we market and distribute steel , '' says William Dennis , vice president , manufacturing and technology , for the American Iron Ore and Steel Institute . </s>
<s> It is n't that major steelmakers have blithely ignored high technology . </s>
<s> In fact , they 've spent billions of dollars to boost the percentage of continously cast steel to 60.9 % in 1988 , from 39.6 % five years before . </s>
<s> Moreover , their balance sheets are rich with diversity , their old plants shuttered , and work forces lean . </s>
<s> But that wo n't suffice . </s>
<s> `` It 's no longer enough to beat the guy down the street . </s>
<s> You have to beat everyone around the world , '' says Mr. Dennis . </s>
<s> He wants to see steelmakers more involved in computers and artificial intelligence . </s>
<s> The problem : They 're saddled with huge plants that require costly maintenance . </s>
<s> And try plying new dollars free in a market that is softening , hurt by a strong dollar and concerned about overcapacity -- the industry 's Darth Vadar . </s>
<s> `` The technology revolution is going to be very threatening to established producers , '' says Peter Marcus , an analyst with PaineWebber Inc . </s>
<s> `` They 've got too much invested in the old stuff and they ca n't get their workers to be flexible . '' </s>
<s> No one expects minimills to eclipse major integrated steelmakers , who remain the undisputed kings of highest-quality steel used for autos and refrigerators . </s>
<s> Nucor 's plant in Crawfordsville , Ind. , ultimately will produce only one million tons annually , a drop in the 40-million-ton-a-year flat-rolled steel bucket , and it will be years before such plants can compete in the high-profit market . </s>
<s> Still , flat-rolled is the steel industry 's bread and butter , representing about half of the 80 million tons of steel expected to be shipped this year . </s>
<s> Moreover , the process is n't without its headaches . </s>
<s> Because all operations are connected , one equipment failure forces a complete plant shutdown . </s>
<s> On some days , the Nucor plant does n't produce anything . </s>
<s> `` At this point , the minimill capacity wo n't make a great dent in the integrated market , but it does challenge them to develop new markets , '' says James McCall , vice president , materials , at Battelle , a technology and management-research giant based in Columbus , Ohio . </s>
<s> Indeed , with demand for steel not growing fast enough to absorb capacity , steelmakers will have to change the way they do business . </s>
<s> In the past , says Armco 's chief economist John Corey , steelmakers made a product and set it out on the loading dock . </s>
<s> `` We said : ` We 've got a product : if you want it , you can buy it , ' '' he says , adding : `` Now we 're figuring out what people need , and are going back to make it . '' </s>
<s> Armco 's sales representatives visit the General Motors Corp. 's Fairfax assembly plant in Kansas City , Mo. , two or three days a week . </s>
<s> When they determined that GM needed parts more quickly , Armco convinced a steel service center to build a processing plant nearby so shipments could be delivered within 15 minutes . </s>
<s> Cementing such relationships with major clients -- car and appliance makers -- is a means of survival , especially when those key clients are relying on a smaller pool of producers and flirting with plastic and aluminum makers . </s>
<s> For example , when Detroit began talking about plastic-bodied cars , the American Iron and Steel Institute began a major lobbying effort to show auto makers how they could use steel more efficiently by simply redesigning how a car door is assembled . </s>
<s> But steelmakers must also find new markets . </s>
<s> After letting aluminum-makers take the recycling lead , a group of the nation 's largest steelmakers started a recycling institute to promote steel cans to an environmentally conscious nation . </s>
<s> Battelle 's Mr. McCall thinks steelmakers should concentrate more on construction . </s>
<s> Weirton Steel Corp. , Weirton , W. Va. , for example , is touting to homeowners fashionable steel doors , with leaded glass inserts , as a secure and energy-efficient alternative to wooden or aluminum ones . </s>
<s> Other steelmakers envision steel roofs covering suburbia . </s>
<s> Still others are looking at overseas markets . </s>
<s> USX is funneling drilling pipe to steel-hungry Soviet Union . </s>
<s> This year , the nation 's largest steelmaker reactivated its overseas sales operation . </s>
<s> Producers also are trying to differentiate by concentrating on higher-profit output , such as coated and electrogalvanized products , which remain beyond the reach of minimills . </s>
<s> Almost all capital-improvement programs announced by major steelmakers within the past year involve building electrogalvanizing lines , used to produce steel for such products as household appliances and car doors . </s>
<s> But unfortunately , that segment is much smaller than the bread-and-butter flat-rolled steel . </s>
<s> `` It 's like everyone climbing out of the QE II and getting into a lifeboat , '' says John Jacobson , an analyst with AUS Consultants . </s>
<s> `` After a while , someone has to go over the side . '' </s>
<s> Although he does n't expect any bankruptcies , he does see more plants being sold or closed . </s>
<s> Robert Crandall , with the Brookings Institute , agrees . </s>
<s> `` Unless there is an enormous rate of economic growth or a further drop in the dollar , it 's unlikely that consumption of U.S. produced steel will grow sufficiently to offset the growth of minimills . '' </s>
<s> Not to mention the incursion of imports . </s>
<s> Japanese and European steelmakers , which have led the recent technology developments , are anxiously awaiting the lifting of trade restraints in 1992 . </s>
<s> Moreover , the U.S. can expect more competition from low-cost producing Pacific Rim and Latin American countries . </s>
<s> A Taiwanese steelmaker recently announced plans to build a Nucor-like plant . </s>
<s> `` People think of the steel business as an old and mundane smokestack business , '' says Mr. Iverson . </s>
<s> `` They 're dead wrong . '' </s>
