<s> Quotron Systems Inc. plans to cut about 400 , or 16 % , of its 2,500 employees over the next several months . </s>
<s> `` This action will continue to keep operating expenses in line '' with revenue , said J. David Hann , president and chief executive officer of Los Angeles-based Quotron . </s>
<s> The move by the financial information and services subsidiary of Citicorp is a `` response to changing conditions in the retail securities industry , which has been contracting '' since October 1987 's stock market crash , the executive added . </s>
<s> Quotron , which Citicorp purchased in 1986 , provides price quotations for securities , particularly stocks . </s>
<s> Quotron also provides trading and other systems , services for brokerage firms , and communications-network services . </s>
<s> Independent providers of financial information , including Quotron , have been under some pressure as the major securities houses try to regain their hold on the production of market data and on the related revenue . </s>
<s> Shearson , Goldman , Sachs & Co. , Morgan Stanley & Co. and Salomon Inc. are discussing formation of a group to sell securities-price data . </s>
<s> The job cuts , to be made in a number of areas at various job levels , are `` a streamlining of operations , '' a spokeswoman said . </s>
<s> The company has no immediate plans to close any operations , she said , but Quotron may subcontract some work that it has been doing in-house , including refurbishment and production of Quotron 1000 equipment used in delivering financial data . </s>
<s> The spokeswoman said the move is n't directly a response to Quotron 's loss of its two biggest customers , Merrill Lynch & Co. and American Express Co. 's Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. , to Automated Data Processing Inc. earlier this year . </s>
<s> The spokeswoman noted that last week , Kidder , Peabody & Co. , the securities subsidiary of General Electric Co. , chose a Quotron subsidiary to provide order-processing services . </s>

<s> Quotron is n't profitable on Citicorp 's books because of the interest charges the New York bank holding company incurred in buying the financial-data concern for $ 680 million , says Ronald I. Mandle , analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Co . </s>
<s> But Citicorp `` does view Quotron -RRB- as being crucial to the financial-services business in the 1990s , '' the analyst added . </s>
