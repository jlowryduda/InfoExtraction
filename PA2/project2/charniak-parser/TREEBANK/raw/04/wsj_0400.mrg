<s> After a bad start , Treasury bonds were buoyed by a late burst of buying to end modestly higher . </s>
<s> `` The market was pretty dull '' for most of the day , said Robert H. Chandross , vice president at Lloyds Bank PLC . </s>
<s> He said some investors were reluctant to plunge into the market ahead of several key economic indicators due this week , especially Friday 's potentially market-moving employment report . </s>
<s> During the first hour of trading yesterday , prices fell as much as 1\/4 point , or down about $ 2.50 for each $ 1,000 face amount . </s>
<s> But market activity was energized as investors started to view the lower price levels as attractive . </s>
<s> And the Treasury 's $ 17.6 billion auction of short-term bills , which generated strong buying interest , helped to lift the bond market out of the doldrums . </s>
<s> `` We saw good retail demand by small banks , individuals and institutions and that is one reason why the market advanced '' late in the day , said Sung Won Sohn , senior vice president and chief economist at Norwest Corp. , Minneapolis . </s>
<s> He said the change in sentiment also reflected perceptions that the slate of economic statistic due this week will be `` conducive to a bond market rally . '' </s>
<s> The employment report , which will provide the first official measure of the economy 's strength in October , is expected to show smaller gains in the generation of new jobs . </s>
<s> Other key economic indicators due this week include today 's release of the September leading indicators index and new-home sales . </s>
<s> Tomorrow , the October purchasing managers report is due and on Thursday comes October chain-store sales . </s>
<s> Despite yesterday 's modest bond market gains , economists say investors are anxious about the Treasury 's huge quarterly refunding of government debt , the timing of which depends on Congressional efforts to raise the debt ceiling . </s>
<s> Although the Treasury will announce details of the November refunding tomorrow , it could be delayed if Congress and President Bush fail to increase the Treasury 's borrowing capacity . </s>
<s> The debt ceiling is scheduled to fall to $ 2.8 trillion from $ 2.87 trillion at midnight tonight . </s>
<s> The Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond rose 1\/8 point . </s>
<s> Mortgage-backed securities were up less than 1\/8 point and investment-grade corporate bonds were unchanged . </s>
<s> Strong demand for New York City 's $ 813 million general obligation bonds propped up the municipal market . </s>
<s> Traders said most municipal bonds ended 1\/2 point higher . </s>
<s> The New York City issue included $ 757 million of tax-exempt bonds priced to yield between 6.50 % to 7.88 % , depending on the maturity . </s>
<s> The $ 56 million of New York 's taxable general obligation bonds were priced to yield between 9.125 % to 9.90 % . </s>
<s> As expected , the longer-term tax-exempt New York bonds had yields nearly as high as those on taxable long-term Treasury bonds . </s>
<s> The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond ended yesterday at about 7.92 % . </s>
<s> Bond dealers said the rates for the long-term tax-exempt New York City bonds were among the highest , as a percentage of Treasury rates , for any New York City issue in recent memory . </s>
<s> A spokesman for New York City Comptroller Harrison Goldin said the high rates reflect investors concerns about the city 's financial health and political uncertainties . </s>
<s> New York bonds , which have been hammered in recent weeks on the pending supply and reports that the city 's economy is growing weaker , rose 1\/2 point yesterday . </s>
<s> Treasury Securities </s>
<s> Treasury bonds ended slightly higher in light trading . </s>
<s> The benchmark 30-year bond ended at 102 7\/32 to yield 7.92 % , compared with Friday 's price of 102 2\/32 to yield 7.93 % . </s>

<s> Short-term interest rates rose at the government 's regular weekly Treasury-bill auction . </s>
<s> The average discount rate on three-month bills was 7.78 % and the rate on six-month bills was 7.62 % . </s>
<s> Those rates are up from 7.52 % and 7.50 % , respectively , at last week 's auction . </s>
<s> Due to the Treasury 's need to raise funds quickly before the current authority to issue debt expires at midnight tonight , yesterday 's auction was structured differently from previous sales . </s>
<s> The Treasury bills sold yesterday settle today , rather than the standard settlement day of Thursday . </s>
<s> And because of the early settlement , the three-month bills actually have a 93-day maturity , and the six-month bills have an 184-day maturity . </s>
<s> Because of the early settlement , the Federal Reserve was unable to purchase bills for its system account . </s>
<s> However , analysts expect the Fed to buy Treasury bills that were auctioned yesterday in the secondary market . </s>
<s> The Treasury also held a hastily scheduled $ 2 billion sale of 51-cash management bills yesterday . </s>
<s> Here are details of yesterday 's three-month and six-month bill auction : </s>
<s> Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value . </s>
<s> Thus , higher bidding narrows the investor 's return while lower bidding widens it . </s>
<s> The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year , while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year . </s>
<s> Both issues are dated Oct. 31 . </s>
<s> The 13-week bills mature Feb. 1 , and the 26-week bills mature May 3 , 1990 . </s>

<s> Corporate Issues </s>
<s> The junk bond prices of Western Union Corp. tumbled after the company said it wo n't proceed with an exchange offer to holders of its reset notes . </s>
<s> The Upper Saddle River , N.J. , communications firm said it is considering alternatives to the restructuring of the senior secured notes because of changes in the high-yield market . </s>
<s> In June , Western Union was forced to reset the interest rate on the senior secured notes due in 1992 to 19 1\/4 % from 16 1\/2 % , a move which increased the firm 's annual interest payments by $ 13.8 million . </s>
<s> Although the notes held at a price of 92 to 93 immediately after the reset , they started falling soon afterward . </s>
<s> Yesterday , Western Union 's senior secured reset notes fell 3 3\/4 points , or about $ 37.50 for each $ 1,000 face amount , to close at 50 1\/4 . </s>
<s> Other Western Union securities were also lower . </s>
<s> The company 's 7.90 % sinking fund debentures were quoted at a bid price of 14 1\/4 and an offered price of 30 , while the 10 3\/4 % subordinated debentures of 1997 were being bid for at 28 and offered at around 34 3\/4 . </s>
<s> The 10 3\/4 % debentures last traded at 35 . </s>
<s> High-yield traders said spreads between the bid and offered prices of Western Union junk bonds have been widening for some time , and in certain cases , bids for Western Union securities are not available . </s>
<s> Elsewhere , prices of investment-grade and high-risk , high-yield junk bonds ended unchanged . </s>
<s> In the new-issue market for junk securities , underwriters at Salomon Brothers Inc. are expected to price today a $ 350 million junk bond offering by Beatrice Co. . </s>
<s> The two-part issue consists of $ 200 million of senior subordinated reset notes maturing in 1997 and $ 150 million of subordinated floating rate notes also maturing in 1997 . </s>
<s> Portfolio managers said expectations are for the issue to be priced at a discount with a coupon of 13 3\/4 % and a yield of about 14 % . </s>
<s> The Chicago-based food and consumer goods concern was acquired in April 1986 in a $ 6.2 billion leveraged buy-out engineered by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co . </s>
<s> Proceeds from the note sale will be used to repay a portion of the bank borrowings used by Beatrice to redeem its $ 526.3 million principal amount of increasing rate debentures in August . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , underwriters at Morgan Stanley & Co. are expected today to price a $ 350 million high-yield offering by Continental Cablevision Inc . </s>
<s> The senior subordinated debentures maturing in 2004 are targeted to be offered at a yield of between 12 5\/8 % to 12 3\/4 % . </s>
<s> Mortgage-Backed Securities </s>

<s> Ginnie Mae 's 9 % issue for November delivery finished at 98 1\/2 , up 4\/32 , and its 10 % issue at 102 3\/8 , up 4\/32 . </s>
<s> Freddie Mac 's 9 % issue ended at 97 19\/32 , up 2\/32 . </s>
<s> In the derivative market , insurance companies have scaled back their purchases of Remic securities , or real estate mortgage investment conduits , as they assess potential claims from the recent California earthquake and hurricane in the Carolinas . </s>
<s> This could mean diminished issuance of derivative mortgage issues during the next few weeks . </s>
<s> Insurance companies have been major buyers of prepayment-protected planned amortization classes -LRB- PACs -RRB- during the past few months . </s>
<s> The PACs appeal to insurance companies and other investors because they have higher yields than topgrade corporate bonds and carry the guarantee of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae , quasi-federal agencies . </s>
<s> In the asset-backed market , Beneficial Corp. offered $ 248 million of securities backed by home-equity loans , the second large deal in the past week . </s>
<s> Last week , a unit of MNC Financial Corp. offered $ 268 million of home-equity securities . </s>
<s> Both the MNC and Beneficial offering were underwritten by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets , the leading Wall Street firm in the home-equity securities market , which was created early this year . </s>
<s> Municipal Issues </s>
<s> The improved tone in the municipal market , largely an offshoot of the New York City sale 's reception , helped municipal futures rebound from early lows , but the spread between the contract and Tbond futures continued to grow more negative . </s>
<s> The MOB spread , or difference between the municipal and T-bond futures contracts , has been near all-time lows in recent trading , driven basically by concerns that new-issue supply would overwhelm demand . </s>
<s> December municipal futures ended up 11\/32 point to 92-14 , having pulled off a morning low of 91-23 as cash municipals rebounded . </s>
<s> But front month T-bond futures settled the afternoon session up a slightly greater 13\/32 at 99-04 . </s>
<s> Foreign Bonds </s>
<s> British government bonds ended moderately higher , encouraged by a steadier pound and a rise in British stocks . </s>
