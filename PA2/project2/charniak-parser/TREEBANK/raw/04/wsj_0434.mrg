<s> Applause for `` Sometimes , Talk Is the Best Medicine , '' in your Oct. 5 Marketplace section . </s>
<s> Indeed , the `` art of doctoring '' does contribute to better health results and discourages unwarranted malpractice litigation . </s>
<s> Elaborating on the concern about doctors ' sacrificing earnings in order to spend `` talk time '' with patients , we are finding the quality of the time spent is the key to true rapport . </s>
<s> Even brief conversations can show caring and trust , and need not restrict the efficiency of the communication or restrain the doctor 's earnings . </s>
<s> The issue is far-reaching . </s>
<s> Right now , the American populace is spending about 12 % of our gross national product on health care . </s>
<s> That amounts to more than $ 350 billion a year . </s>
<s> And it is estimated that more than 20 % of that , $ 70 billion , goes to `` defensive medicine '' -- those measures taken by doctors to protect themselves from the most unlikely possibilities . </s>
<s> So we all stand to benefit if patient-physician relations become a `` partnership . '' </s>
