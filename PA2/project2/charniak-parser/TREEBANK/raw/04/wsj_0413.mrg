<s> If there 's somethin' strange in your neighborhood ... </s>
<s> If there 's something ' weird and it do n't look good . </s>
<s> Who ya gon na call ? </s>
<s> For starters , some people call Ed and Lorraine Warren . </s>
<s> When it comes to busting ghosts , the Monroe , Conn. , couple are perfect demons . </s>
<s> They claim to have busted spirits , poltergeists and other spooks in hundreds of houses around the country . </s>
<s> They say they now get three or four `` legitimate '' calls a week from people harried by haunts . </s>
<s> `` I firmly believe in angels , devils and ghosts , '' says Mr. Warren , whose business card identifies him as a `` demonologist . '' </s>
<s> If psychics do n't work , but your house still seems haunted , you can call any one of a swelling band of skeptics such as Richard Busch . </s>
<s> A professional magician and musician , he heads the Pittsburgh branch of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of the Paranormal . </s>
<s> Mr. Busch says there is a scientific explanation for all haunts , and he can even tell you how to encourage the spirits . </s>
<s> `` All you have to do is eat a big pizza , and then go to bed , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` You 'll have weird dreams , too . '' </s>
<s> Either way , the ghostbusting business is going like gangbusters . </s>
<s> Tales of haunts and horrors are proliferating beyond the nation 's Elm Streets and Amityvilles . </s>
<s> `` I get calls nearly every day from people who have ghosts in their house , '' says Raymond Hyman , a skeptical psychology professor at the University of Oregon . </s>
<s> In a public opinion poll published in the October issue of Parents Magazine , a third of those queried said they believe that ghosts or spirits make themselves known to people . </s>
<s> `` The movies , the books , the tabloids -- even Nancy Reagan is boosting this stuff , '' says Paul Kurtz , a philosophy professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo , who heads the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of the Paranormal . </s>
<s> The committee , formed in 1967 , now has 60 chapters around the world . </s>
<s> The spirits , of course , could hardly care less whether people do or do n't believe in them . </s>
<s> They do n't even give a nod to human sensibilities by celebrating Halloween . </s>
<s> For the spooks it 's just another day of ectoplasmic business as usual , ghostbusters say ; the holiday seems to occasion no unusual number of ghost reports . </s>
<s> One of the busiest ghostbusters is Robert Baker , a 68-year-old semi-retired University of Kentucky psychology professor whose bushy gray eyebrows arch at the mere mention of a ghost . </s>
<s> Mr. Baker says he has personally bested more than 50 haunts , from aliens to poltergeists . </s>
<s> Mr. Baker heads the Kentucky Association of Science Educators and Skeptics . </s>
<s> Like Hollywood 's Ghostbusters , Kentucky 's stand ready to roll when haunts get out of hand . </s>
<s> But they do n't careen around in an old Cadillac , wear funny suits or blast away at slimy spirits . </s>
<s> Mr. Baker drives a 1987 Chevy and usually wears a tweed jacket on his ghostbusting forays . </s>
<s> `` I 've never met a ghost that could n't be explained away by perfectly natural means , '' he says . </s>
<s> When a Louisville woman complained that a ghost was haunting her attic , Mr. Baker discovered a rat dragging a trap across the rafters . </s>
<s> A foul-smelling demon supposedly plagued a house in Mannington , Ky . </s>
<s> Mr. Baker found an opening under the house that led to a fume-filled coal mine . </s>
<s> When the weather cools , Mr. Baker says , hobos often hole up in abandoned houses . </s>
<s> `` People see activity in there , and the next thing you know , you 've got a haunting , '' he says . </s>
<s> On a recent afternoon , Mr. Baker and a reporter go ghost-busting , visiting Kathleen Stinnett , a Lexington woman who has phoned the University of Kentucky to report mysterious happenings in her house . </s>
<s> Mrs. Stinnett says she never believed in ghosts before , but lately her vacuum cleaner turned itself on , a telephone flew off its stand , doors slammed inexplicably , and she heard footsteps in her empty kitchen . </s>
<s> `` I was doing the laundry and nearly broke my neck running upstairs to see who was there , and it was nobody , '' she says , eyes wide at the recollection . </s>
<s> Mr. Baker hears her out , pokes around a bit , asks a few questions and proposes some explanations . </s>
<s> Of the self-starting vacuum cleaner , he says : `` Could be Cuddles , -LCB- Mrs. Stinnett 's dog -RCB- . '' </s>
<s> The flying telephone : `` You tangle the base cord around a chair leg , and the receiver does seem to fly off . '' </s>
<s> The ghostly footsteps : `` Interstate 64 is a block away , and heavy traffic can sure set a house to vibrating . '' </s>
<s> `` I 'm not sure he 's explained everything , '' Mrs. Stinnett says grudgingly . </s>
<s> `` There are some things that have gone on here that nobody can explain , '' she says . </s>
<s> Mr. Baker promises to return if the haunting continues . </s>
<s> For especially stubborn haunts , Mr. Baker carries a secret weapon , a vial of cornstarch . </s>
<s> `` I tell people it 's the groundup bones of saints , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` I sprinkle a little around and tell the demons to leave . </s>
<s> It 's reassuring , and it usually works . '' </s>
<s> Oregon 's Mr. Hyman has investigated claims of flying cats , apparitions and bouncing chandeliers and has come up with a plausible explanation , he says , for every one . </s>
<s> `` Invariably , '' he says , `` eyewitnesses are untrustworthy . '' </s>
<s> Two years ago , a Canadian reader bet Omni Magazine $ 1,000 that it could n't debunk the uncanny goings-on in `` the Oregon Vortex , '' a former Indian burial ground in southern Oregon . </s>
<s> To viewers from a distance , visitors to the spot seemed to shrink disproportionately , relative to the background . </s>
<s> The magazine called in Mr. Hyman as a consultant . </s>
<s> He showed up with a carpenter 's level , carefully measured every surface and showed how the apparent shrinkage was caused by the perspective . </s>
<s> `` A very striking illusion , '' Mr. Hyman says now , his voice dripping with skepticism , `` but an illusion nevertheless . '' </s>
<s> The Canadian wound up writing a check . </s>
<s> The Rev. Alphonsus Trabold , a theology professor and exorcism expert at St. Bonaventure University in Olean , N.Y. , frequently is asked to exorcise unruly spirits , and he often obliges . </s>
<s> `` On certain occasions a spirit could be earthbound and make itself known , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` It happens . '' </s>
<s> Father Trabold often uses what he calls `` a therapeutic exorcism '' : a few prayers and an admonition to the spirit to leave . </s>
<s> `` If the person believes there 's an evil spirit , you ask it to be gone , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` The suggestion itself may do the healing . '' </s>
<s> But sometimes more energetic attacks are required . </s>
<s> To wrestle with a demon in a house owned by a Litchfield , Conn. , woman , the Warrens recently called in an exorcist , the Rev. Robert McKenna , a dissident clergyman who hews to the Catholic Church 's old Latin liturgy . </s>
<s> I attend , and so does a television crew from New York City . </s>
<s> Mr. Warren pronounces the Litchfield case `` your typical demonic infestation . '' </s>
<s> A Scottish dwarf built the small red house 110 years ago and now his demonic ghost haunts it , Mr. Warren says . </s>
<s> The owner , who begs anonymity , asserts that the dwarf , appearing as a dark shadow , has manhandled her , tossing her around the living room and yanking out a hank of hair . </s>
<s> Two previous exorcisms have failed . </s>
<s> `` This is a very tenacious ghost , '' Mr. Warren says darkly . </s>
<s> Father McKenna moves through the house praying in Latin , urging the demon to split . </s>
<s> Suddenly the woman begins swaying and then writhing . </s>
<s> `` She 's being attacked by the demon , '' Mrs. Warren stagewhispers as the priest sprinkles holy water over the squirming woman , and the television camera grinds . </s>
<s> A half-hour later , the woman is smiling and chatting ; the demon seems to have gone . </s>
<s> But Mr. Warren says the woman has `` psychic burns '' on her back from the confrontation . </s>
<s> She declines to show them . </s>
<s> `` This was an invisible , powerful force that 's almost impossible for a layman to contemplate , '' Mr. Warren says solemnly as the ghostbusting entourage packs up to leave . </s>
<s> `` This time though , '' he says , `` I think we got it . '' </s>
