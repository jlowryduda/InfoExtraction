<s> Copper futures prices failed to extend Friday 's rally . </s>
<s> Declines came because of concern that demand for copper may slow down . </s>
<s> The December contract was down three cents a pound , settling at $ 1.1280 , which was just above the day 's low of $ 1.1270 . </s>
<s> Futures prices fell during three of five sessions last week , and the losses , individually and cumulatively , were greater than the advances . </s>
<s> Two of the major factors buoying prices , the prolonged strikes at the Highland Valley mine in Canada and the Cananea mine in Mexico , were finally resolved . </s>
<s> Also , the premiums paid by the U.S. government on a purchase of copper for the U.S. Mint were lower than expected , and acted as a price depressant , analysts said . </s>
<s> The mint purchases were at premiums about 4 1\/2 cents a pound above the respective prices for the copper . </s>
<s> At the time merchants were asking for premiums of about five cents a pound . </s>
<s> All this has led to prolonged selling in futures , mostly on the part of computer-guided funds . </s>
<s> Prices fell through levels regarded as important support areas , which added to the selling . </s>
<s> The reluctance of traders to buy contracts indicates that they have begun focusing on demand rather than supply . </s>
<s> At least one analyst noted that as production improves , the concern among traders is whether the prospective increased supply will find buyers because of uncertainty over national economies . </s>
<s> `` Demand from Japan is expected to continue strong , but not from other areas of the world into the first quarter of next year , '' he said . </s>
<s> Japan normally depends heavily on the Highland Valley and Cananea mines as well as the Bougainville mine in Papua New Guinea . </s>
<s> Recently , Japan has been buying copper elsewhere . </s>
<s> But as Highland Valley and Cananea begin operating , they are expected to resume their roles as Japan 's suppliers . </s>
<s> According to Fred Demler , metals economist for Drexel Burnham Lambert , New York , `` Highland Valley has already started operating and Cananea is expected to do so soon . '' </s>
<s> The Bougainville mine is generally expected to remain closed until at least the end of the year . </s>
<s> It has n't been operating since May 15 because of attacks by native landowners . </s>
<s> A recent attempt to resume operations was cut short quickly by these attacks . </s>
<s> However , traders disregarded a potential production disruption in Chile and a continued drop in inventories . </s>
<s> Workers at two Chilean mines , Los Bronces and El Soldado , which belong to the Exxon-owned Minera Disputado group , will vote Thursday on whether to strike after a two-year labor pact ends today . </s>
<s> The mines produced a total of 110,000 tons of copper in 1988 . </s>
<s> According to Drexel 's Mr. Demler , the potential strike is expected to be resolved quickly , which may be one reason why the situation did n't affect prices much . </s>
<s> Another analyst said that , if there was any concern , it was that a strike could encourage other walkouts in Chile . </s>
<s> London Metal Exchange copper inventories fell 550 tons last week to 83,950 tons , a smaller-than-expected decline . </s>
<s> But that development also had little effect on traders ' sentiment . </s>
<s> Mr. Demler said that stocks of copper in U.S. producers ' hands at the end of September were down 16,000 metric tons from August to 30,000 tons . </s>
<s> Outside the U.S. , he said , producer stocks at the end of August were 273,000 tons , down 3,000 tons from the end of July . </s>
<s> Consumer stocks of copper in the U.S. fell to 44,000 tons at the end of September from 54,000 tons a month earlier , and stocks of copper held by consumers and merchants outside of the U.S. at the end of July stood at 123,000 tons , down from 125,000 tons in June . </s>
<s> The high point of foreigners ' copper stocks this year was 136,000 tons at the end of April , according to Mr. Demler . </s>
<s> In other commodity markets yesterday : </s>
<s> GRAINS AND SOYBEANS : </s>
<s> The prices of most corn , soybean and wheat futures contracts dropped slightly as farmers in the Midwest continued to rebuild stockpiles that were depleted by the 1988 drought . </s>
<s> Buying by the Soviets has helped to prop up corn prices in recent weeks , but a lack of any new purchases kept prices in the doldrums . </s>
<s> COFFEE : </s>
<s> Futures prices rose slightly in a market filled with rumors that a new international coffee agreement might still be achieved . </s>
<s> The December contract ended with a gain of 1.29 cents a pound at 74.35 cents . </s>
<s> According to one analyst , prices opened higher because of reports over the weekend that Brazil and Colombia , at the Pan-American summit meeting in Costa Rica , had agreed to a reduction in their coffee export quotas for the sake of creating a new agreement . </s>
<s> The reports , attributed to the Colombian minister of economic development , said Brazil would give up 500,000 bags of its quota and Colombia 200,000 bags , the analyst said . </s>
<s> These reports were later denied by a high Brazilian official , who said Brazil was n't involved in any coffee discussions on quotas , the analyst said . </s>
<s> The Colombian minister was said to have referred to a letter that he said President Bush sent to Colombian President Virgilio Barco , and in which President Bush said it was possible to overcome obstacles to a new agreement . </s>
<s> The minister was also quoted as saying that a new pact could be achieved during the first half of next year , according to the analyst . </s>
<s> PRECIOUS METALS : </s>
<s> Futures prices showed modest changes in light trading volume . </s>
<s> December delivery gold eased 40 cents an ounce to $ 380.80 . </s>
<s> December silver was off 3.7 cents an ounce at $ 5.2830 . </s>
<s> January platinum rose 90 cents an ounce at $ 500.20 . </s>
<s> The market turned quiet after rising sharply late last week , according to one analyst . </s>
<s> Last week 's uncertainty in the stock market and a weaker dollar triggered a flight to safety , he said , but yesterday the market lacked such stimuli . </s>
<s> There was some profit-taking because prices for all the precious metals had risen to levels at which there was resistance to further advance , he said . </s>
<s> The dollar was also slightly firmer and prompted some selling , as well , according to the analyst . </s>
