<s> The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued New York state for age discrimination against appointed state judges . </s>
<s> The suit , filed in federal court in Manhattan , charges that New York 's mandatory retirement age of 76 violates federal law . </s>
<s> Separately , the commission intervened in a Connecticut state judge 's age-bias suit in federal court in New Haven . </s>
<s> The commission 's filing in that case challenges Connecticut 's mandatory retirement age of 70 for appointed judges . </s>
<s> The New York suit was filed on behalf of Justice Isaac Rubin , whose appointment to the state appellate division expires at year end , and all other judges hurt by the alleged age discrimination . </s>
<s> The suit , assigned to federal Judge Kimba Wood , seeks a permanent injunction , back pay for judges who have been forced to retire , reinstatement of retired judges and `` other affirmative relief necessary to eradicate the effects of -LRB- New York 's -RRB- unlawful employment practices . '' </s>
<s> Justice Rubin , a state judge since 1969 , said the mandatory-retirement age hurts the court system because it deprives the state of experienced judges still capable of serving on the bench . </s>
<s> `` The issue is n't age -- age is just a number . </s>
<s> The issue is one of a judge 's experience , his competence and his physical ability to serve on the bench , '' Justice Rubin said . </s>
<s> `` I 've had no problems performing my duties and responsibilities . '' </s>
<s> Because Justice Rubin turned 76 on May 9 , he is n't eligible to be reappointed to the bench at the end of the year . </s>
<s> The suit 's impact on New York may be narrow , however . </s>
<s> Most New York judges are elected , and the federal age-discrimination law does n't apply to elected officials , said James L. Lee , regional attorney for the EEOC in New York . </s>
<s> Under New York law , elected judges must retire at age 70 , but then can be appointed to two-year terms until they reach 76 . </s>
<s> A spokeswoman for the state 's Office of Court Administration declined to comment on the suit . </s>
<s> But she said the state currently has 35 appointed judges who are over 70 . </s>
<s> In Connecticut , however , most state judges are appointed by the governor and approved by the state legislature . </s>
<s> The parties in the Connecticut case have agreed to stay proceedings pending the appeal of another EEOC age-bias case against Vermont . </s>
<s> In the Vermont case , a federal judge ruled that the state 's mandatory age of 70 for appointed judges was illegal ; Vermont 's appeal of that decision is pending before the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan . </s>
<s> Aaron Ment , Connecticut 's chief court administrator , declined to comment on the suit and the EEOC 's intervention . </s>
<s> He said the state has 165 appointed judges and 15 `` trial referees , '' who are former judges over age 70 and serve a restricted role on the bench . </s>
<s> ORGANIZED CRIME Strike Forces likely to be abolished next month . </s>
<s> U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh 's plan to dissolve the 14 regional organized-crime strike forces is expected to go into effect next month , despite the opposition of Democratic congressional leaders and lawyers in the special units . </s>
<s> The units are autonomous from U.S. attorneys ' offices and focus exclusively on prosecuting organized-crime cases . </s>
<s> In February , Mr. Thornburgh announced his plan to abolish the units . </s>
<s> He says the strike-force lawyers will work more efficiently under the supervision of U.S. attorneys . </s>
<s> Mr. Thornburgh will be free to disband the strike forces after Congress approves a $ 479 million appropriation for federal law-enforcement and drug-interdiction agencies , according to David Runkel , a Justice Department spokesman . </s>
<s> The bill is expected to pass in Congress next month . </s>
<s> Congress temporarily halted Mr. Thornburgh 's effort with an appropriation resolution that prohibited him from using budgeted funds to implement his plan . </s>
<s> Opponents say Mr. Thornburgh 's plan will needlessly break up longtime , tightly knit crime-fighting units that have successfully prosecuted major organized-crime figures . </s>
<s> They predict that organized-crime activity will increase once the units are dissolved and their responsibilities transferred to U.S. attorneys ' offices . </s>
<s> Some former strike-force personnel say the units have already begun to break up . </s>
<s> The Eastern District unit in Brooklyn , N.Y. , lost seven of its 15 attorneys this year partly because the lawyers were troubled by the proposed reorganization , says Laura A. Brevetti , who left the strike force to join Morrison Cohen Singer & Weinstein , a New York law firm . </s>
<s> `` Those who have left have expressed an opinion that the strike force should continue , '' Ms. Brevetti says . </s>
<s> But Mr. Runkel contends there has been no exodus of strike-force lawyers . </s>
<s> He says 27 lawyers have left and 21 have been hired since Mr. Thornburgh announced his plan . </s>
<s> At the time the plan was announced , there were 135 lawyers . </s>
<s> Some congressional leaders intend to continue to fight for independent strike forces . </s>
<s> A spokesman for Sen. Edward M. Kennedy -LRB- D. , Mass . -RRB- says Mr. Thornburgh would be required to reinstate the units next year if an proposed omnibus crime bill is passed . </s>
<s> Among other things , the bill calls for a reorganization of the Justice Department . </s>
<s> The Senate is expected to consider the bill shortly , says the senator 's spokesman . </s>
<s> Mr. Runkel says he doubts Mr. Kennedy can muster enough congressional support to reorganize the Justice Department . </s>
<s> `` We will vigorously oppose the bill , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` I do n't think -LRB- the reorganization is -RRB- going to happen . '' </s>
<s> WHITMAN & RANSOM recruits lawyers from disbanding firm : </s>
<s> The 204-lawyer New York firm will bring in at least 12 partners and a not yet determined number of associates from Golenbock & Barell , which will dissolve Dec. 31 . </s>
<s> Golenbock , with 35 lawyers , has lost several partners during the past year . </s>
<s> Some Golenbock lawyers wo n't be invited to join Whitman & Ransom , according to partners at both firms . </s>
<s> Whitman & Ransom managing partner Maged F. Riad said the Golenbock recruits will enhance the firm 's corporate and litigation departments . </s>
<s> SHORT SKIRTS not welcome in Texas court : </s>
<s> Shelly Hancock , a male county court judge in Houston , refused to let a woman plead guilty to a drunk-driving charge because her skirt stopped three inches above her knees . </s>
<s> The woman appeared in court Thursday to enter her plea , but when she started to approach the bench , she was stopped by Judge Hancock . </s>
<s> He told the woman 's lawyer , Victor Blaine , that the short skirt was inappropriate for a court appearance . </s>
<s> Despite Mr. Blaine 's protests , the judge rescheduled her case for Nov. 27 . </s>
<s> Kelly Siegler , an assistant district attorney who was in the courtroom , disputed suggestions the action was sexist , saying she had seen Judge Hancock turn away male defendants dressed in shorts , tank tops or muscle shirts `` many times . '' </s>
<s> Judge Hancock did n't return phone calls . </s>
