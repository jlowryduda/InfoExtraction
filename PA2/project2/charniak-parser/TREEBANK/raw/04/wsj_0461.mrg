<s> The Treasury Department proposed that banks be required to keep detailed records of international wire transfers , which officials believe is the main vehicle used by drug traffickers to move billions of dollars in and out of the U.S. . </s>
<s> In recent testimony on Capitol Hill , Treasury officials said they were considering the new reporting requirements , and the expected publication of the proposal in the Federal Register today is the first official step toward creating final regulations . </s>
<s> The Treasury is still working out the details with bank trade associations and the other government agencies that have a hand in fighting money laundering . </s>
<s> Among the possibilities the Treasury is considering are requirements that banks keep records identifying the originators and recipients of international wire transfers . </s>
<s> Another suggestion would draw banks more directly into tracking down money launderers by developing a `` suspicious international wire transfer profile , '' which banks would use to spotlight questionable payments . </s>
<s> But banks may prefer using a profile that targets selected transactions , rather than a blanket reporting requirement . </s>
<s> Banks now are required only to report cash deposits or withdrawals of $ 10,000 or more . </s>
<s> But wire transfers from a standing account -- including those bigger than $ 10,000 -- are n't reported . </s>
<s> Officials believe this has left a gaping loophole that illegal drug businesses are exploiting . </s>
<s> Authorities estimate that revenues from illegal drugs in the U.S. total about $ 110 billion annually . </s>
<s> Sen. John Kerry -LRB- D. , Mass. -RRB- , chairman of a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee that oversees the issue of money laundering , criticized the proposal for ignoring wire transfers between foreign banks that are executed and cleared on U.S. wire systems . </s>
<s> The American Bankers Association did n't have any comment on the plan . </s>
<s> The proposal now enters a 60-day comment period , after which the Treasury will propose final regulations , followed by another comment period . </s>
