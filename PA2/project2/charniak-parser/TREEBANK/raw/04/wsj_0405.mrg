<s> It was supposed to be a routine courtesy call . </s>
<s> A half-dozen Soviet space officials , in Tokyo in July for an exhibit , stopped by to see their counterparts at the National Space Development Agency of Japan . </s>
<s> But after a few pleasantries , the Soviets unexpectedly got serious . </s>
<s> The Soviets have a world-leading space program , the guests noted . </s>
<s> Would n't the Japanese like a piece of it ? </s>
<s> The visitors then listed technologies up for sale , including launch services and propulsion hardware . </s>
<s> `` We were just surprised , '' says Tad Inada , NASDA 's director for international affairs . </s>
<s> `` Shocked . '' </s>
<s> That Moscow , with its dilapidated economic machine , would try to sell high technology to Japan , one of the world 's high-tech leaders , sounds like a coals-to-Newcastle notion . </s>
<s> But `` the Soviet Union has areas where it is n't behind Japan , '' says Mikhail Shapovalov of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations . </s>
<s> `` We have obtained through the development of Cosmos -LCB- the Soviet space program -RCB- technologies you do n't see anywhere else . '' </s>
<s> The sales pitch might n't be as farfetched as it seems . </s>
<s> Japan-U.S. trade relations are bumpy these days , and some Japanese favor decreasing their reliance on U.S. technology in light of the FSX fighter-plane flap , when U.S. officials reversed an earlier decision and refused to share certain crucial fighter-plane technology . </s>
<s> And , despite its image as a technology superpower , Japan has a lot of weaknesses . </s>
<s> It 's a world leader in semiconductors , but behind the U.S. in making the computers that use those chips . </s>
<s> It 's a world leader in auto manufacturing , but its aviation industry is struggling , and its space program is years behind the U.S. , the Europeans and the Soviets . </s>
<s> One question being debated in the Soviet Union is how to use the defense sector 's research-and-production expertise in the rest of the economy . </s>
<s> Many plants that used to make military equipment are now being ordered to produce televisions , videocassette recorders , small tractors and food-processing machinery . </s>
<s> The Soviets also hope to make better use of their considerable expertise in theoretical science , which has helped them win twice as many Nobel science prizes as the Japanese . </s>
<s> Where they lag behind the Japanese is in turning the scientific inventiveness into improved production . </s>
<s> By contrast , the Japanese have proved adept at making use of Soviet inventions . </s>
<s> Kobe Steel Ltd. adopted Soviet casting technology in 1966 and used it for 14 years until it developed its own system . </s>
<s> Kawasaki Steel Corp. bought a Soviet steel-casting patent two years ago and has jointly developed the system with the Soviets . </s>
<s> In 1991 , the Soviets will take a Japanese journalist into space , the first Japanese to go into orbit . </s>
<s> Soviet efforts to sell their technology abroad do n't appear to worry the U.S. , Japan 's principal ally . </s>
<s> `` We have never opposed the development of economic relations between our allies and the Soviet Union , '' says a State Department official . </s>
<s> `` Frankly , I would n't expect the Japanese to get hooked on anybody 's technology , least of all the Soviets . '' </s>
<s> Under Mikhail Gorbachev 's perestroika , the Soviets have sought economic ties all over the world , including new export markets . </s>
<s> They believe technology is one of their best bets , and some Soviet officials say Moscow will even consider declassifying military know-how if the price is right . </s>
<s> The Soviets held export exhibitions that included high-tech items in New York and West Germany . </s>
<s> Last week , a Soviet delegation came to Japan to push more space technologies . </s>
<s> Japan is a major target for the Soviets . </s>
<s> In August , representatives of Keidanren , Japan 's largest business organization , visited Moscow to explore exports and investments that would help the Soviet economy . </s>
<s> Out of the blue , the Soviet Chamber of Commerce handed over details on 59 technologies that the Japanese might want to buy . </s>
<s> These mainly involved such areas as materials -- advanced soldering machines , for example -- and medical developments derived from experimentation in space , such as artificial blood vessels . </s>
<s> A main motive is hard cash . </s>
<s> But , while the Soviets ca n't expect direct technology flow from Japan , they also hope to benefit from Japanese manufacturing expertise . </s>
<s> `` The Soviet Union has a lot of know-how , but it has been difficult to put that into actual production because of various structural problems in the economy , '' says Mr. Shapovalov , the Foreign Ministry official . </s>
<s> The Soviets are `` contemplating a flexible system under which it would be possible to develop -LCB- technology -RCB- jointly and even to market it jointly , '' he says . </s>
<s> Even if the Japanese find Soviet technology desirable , such discussions would be fraught with political complications . </s>
<s> Still stinging from the international backlash over the sale two years ago of sensitive military technology to the Soviets by a subsidiary of Japan 's Toshiba Corp. , many Japanese are eager to avoid appearing to help the Soviets in any way . </s>
<s> Another hurdle concerns Japan 's attempts to persuade the Soviet Union to relinquish its post-World War II control of four islands north of Japan . </s>
<s> So far , the Soviets have provided only the sketchiest information about their technology and business plans . </s>
<s> And what they have shown is n't impressive . </s>
<s> `` My impression is that there is n't anything which arouses our interest at first glance , '' says an official from Japan 's Ministry of International Trade and Industry . </s>
