<s> Two gunmen entered a Maryland restaurant , ordered two employees to lie on the floor and shot them in the backs of their heads . </s>
<s> The killers fled with less than $ 100 . </s>
<s> Describing this and other grisly killings , Sen. Strom Thurmond -LRB- R. , S.C . -RRB- recently urged fellow lawmakers to revive a broad federal death penalty . </s>
<s> `` The ultimate punishment , '' he declared , `` will protect the law-abiding from the vicious , cruel individuals who commit these crimes . '' </s>
<s> There 's just one problem : The law that Sen. Thurmond is pushing would be irrelevant in the case of the Maryland restaurant murders and almost all other killings . </s>
<s> Most murders are state crimes , so any federal capital-punishment law probably would turn out to be more symbolism than substance . </s>
<s> Yet the bill is riding high on the furor over drug trafficking . </s>
<s> Senate Republicans , after repeatedly failing to attach death-penalty amendments to unrelated legislation , have finally gotten a full-blown death-penalty bill through committee . </s>
<s> The Democratic leadership agreed to allow a floor vote on the issue before the end of the year -- a debate certain to focus on the alleged racial inequality of death sentencing . </s>
<s> Even some Democrats concede that there is probably a majority in the Senate that favors some kind of broad capital-punishment measure . </s>
<s> The pending bill , introduced by Mr. Thurmond , would revive the long-dormant federal death-penalty laws by instituting legal procedures required by the Supreme Court . </s>
<s> In 1972 , the high court swept aside all capital-punishment laws -- federal and state alike -- as unconstitutional . </s>
<s> But in 1976 , the court permitted resurrection of such laws , if they meet certain procedural requirements . </s>
<s> For instance , juries would have to consider specific `` aggravating '' and `` mitigating '' factors before deciding whether to condemn someone to death . </s>
<s> Since that 1976 ruling , 37 states have reintroduced the death penalty . </s>
<s> But congressional Democrats have blocked the same from occurring at the federal level , with the exception of a 1988 law allowing capital punishment for certain drug-related homicides . </s>
<s> The Thurmond bill would establish a federally administered death sentence for 23 crimes , most of which were formerly punishable by death under federal statutes that the Supreme Court invalidated . </s>
<s> Among these crimes are murder on federal land , presidential assassination and espionage . </s>
<s> The Thurmond bill would also add five new crimes punishable by death , including murder for hire . </s>
<s> -LRB- Separately , the Senate last week passed a bill permitting execution of terrorists who kill Americans abroad . -RRB- </s>
<s> Amid the swirl of punitive rhetoric surrounding the issue , one critical question involves whether a federal death penalty , on top of existing state laws , would deter any would-be criminals . </s>
<s> For one thing , it 's unlikely that many people would receive federal death sentences , let alone be executed . </s>
<s> Most of the crimes incorporated in the Thurmond bill are exceedingly rare -- killing a Supreme Court justice , for instance , or deliberately causing a train wreck that results in a death . </s>
<s> In fact , only 28 defendants would have been eligible for federal death sentences if the Thurmond bill had been in effect in the past three years , according to a study by the Senate Judiciary Committee 's Democratic staff . </s>
<s> The last federal execution before the Supreme Court 's 1972 ruling banning the death penalty took place in 1963 , meaning that the federal government did n't exercise its execution authority for eight years . </s>
<s> `` In that sense , the whole debate is sort of a fraud , '' argues a Democratic Senate staff member . </s>
<s> `` It 's distracting attention from serious issues , like how to make DEA , FBI and Customs work together '' on drug enforcement . </s>
<s> Republicans acknowledge that few people would be executed under the Thurmond bill , but they contend that is n't the point . </s>
<s> `` Many scholars are of the opinion that the mere existence of the penalty deters many people from the commission of capital crimes , '' says Sen. Orrin Hatch -LRB- R. , Utah -RRB- . </s>
<s> Executions , regardless of how frequently they occur , are also `` proper retribution '' for heinous crimes , Mr. Hatch argues . </s>
<s> Thomas Boyd , a senior Justice Department official , says the new federal drug-related crimes punishable by death since last November may result in a jump in capital sentences , though that has n't happened so far . </s>
<s> In addition to resuscitating the old issue of whether death sentences deter criminals , this bill has made race a major part of the death-penalty debate . </s>
<s> Before the bill left committee , Sen. Edward Kennedy -LRB- D. , Mass . -RRB- attached an amendment that would allow a defendant to escape from a death sentence in jurisdictions shown to have meted out executions in a racist manner . </s>
<s> The amendment prompted an ironic protest from Mr. Thurmond , who complained that it would `` kill '' capital punishment . </s>
<s> A large number of studies suggest that state judges and juries have imposed the penalty in a racially discriminatory fashion . </s>
<s> And the Kennedy amendment would invade not only federal but state sentencings , in two important ways . </s>
<s> It would allow all defendants to introduce statistical evidence showing racially disproportionate application of the death penalty in the past . </s>
<s> And it would shift the burden to prosecutors to disprove that discrimination caused any statistical racial disparities . </s>
<s> `` That burden is very difficult , if not impossible , to meet , '' says Mr. Boyd . </s>
<s> `` How do you prove a negative ? '' </s>
<s> Since most prosecutors would n't be able to demonstrate conclusively that racial considerations did n't affect sentencing , executions everywhere might come to a halt , Mr. Boyd explains . </s>
<s> At least 15 major studies purport to show that particular states have imposed the death penalty disproportionately against killers of whites compared with blacks , and against black defendants compared with white defendants . </s>
<s> Conservatives question the validity of the studies and note that the Supreme Court ruled in 1987 that such research , regardless of its accuracy , is n't relevant to a constitutional attack on a particular death sentence . </s>
<s> The Kennedy amendment would , in effect , legislate around the Supreme Court ruling . </s>
<s> Lawyers would eagerly seize on the provision in their death-penalty appeals , says Richard Burr , director of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund 's capital-punishment defense team . </s>
<s> Mr. Kennedy failed to get his amendment incorporated into last year 's anti-drug legislation , and it will be severely attacked on the Senate floor this time around . </s>
<s> But if it survives , it could prompt other statutory changes , according to the Mr. Burr . </s>
<s> It might force Congress and the states to narrow the death penalty only to convictions shown to be relatively free of racial imbalance -- murders by repeat offenders who torture their victims , perhaps . </s>
<s> Narrowing the penalty in this fashion would clearly reduce whatever deterrent effect it now has . </s>
<s> And that , in turn , would only strengthen the argument of those who oppose execution under any circumstances . </s>
