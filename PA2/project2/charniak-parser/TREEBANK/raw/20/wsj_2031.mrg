<s> William Seidman , chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , said Lincoln Savings & Loan Association should have been seized by the government in 1986 to contain losses that he estimated will cost taxpayers as much as $ 2 billion . </s>
<s> Mr. Seidman , who has been the nation 's top bank regulator , inherited the problems of Lincoln , based in Irvine , Calif. , after his regulatory role was expanded by the new savings-and-loan bailout law . </s>
<s> He made his comments before House Banking Committee hearings to investigate what appears to be the biggest thrift disaster in a scandal-ridden industry . </s>
<s> The inquiry also will cover the actions of Charles Keating Jr. , who is chairman of American Continental Corp. , Lincoln 's parent , and who contributed heavily to several U.S. senators . </s>
<s> Mr. Seidman told the committee that the Resolution Trust Corp. , the agency created to sell sick thrifts , has studied Lincoln 's examination reports by former regulators dating back to 1986 . </s>
<s> `` My staff indicated that had we made such findings in one of our own institutions , we would have sought an immediate cease-and-desist order to stop the hazardous operations , '' Mr. Seidman said . </s>
<s> When Lincoln was seized by the government , for example , 15 % of its loans , or $ 250 million , were to borrowers who were buying real estate from one of American Continental 's 50 other subsidiaries , according to Mr. Seidman . </s>
<s> But the government did n't step in until six months ago , when thrift officials put Lincoln into conservatorship -- the day after American Continental filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors . </s>
<s> The bankruptcy filing , the government has charged in a $ 1.1 billion civil lawsuit , was part of a pattern to shift insured deposits to the parent company , which used the deposits as a cache for real-estate deals . </s>
<s> The deposits that have been transferred to other subsidiaries are now under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court . </s>
<s> `` I think it 's fairly clear -LCB- Mr. Keating -RCB- knew , '' that regulators were set to seize Lincoln , Mr. Seidman said . </s>
<s> Further investigation , he said , may result in further actions against Lincoln 's executives , said Mr. Seidman , `` including fraud actions . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Keating , for his part , has filed suit alleging that regulators unlawfully seized the thrift . </s>
<s> Leonard Bickwit , an attorney in Washington for Mr. Keating , declined to comment on the hearings , except to say , `` We will be responding comprehensively in several forums to each of these allegations at the appropriate time . '' </s>
<s> Lincoln 's treatment by former thrift regulators , in an agency disbanded by the new law , has proved embarrassing for five senators who received thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from Mr. Keating . </s>
<s> Mr. Seidman said yesterday , for example , that Sen. Dennis DeConcini -LRB- D. , Ariz. -RRB- , who received $ 48,100 in contributions from Mr. Keating , phoned Mr. Seidman to request that he push for a sale of Lincoln before it would be seized . </s>
<s> After the government lawsuit was filed against Lincoln , Sen. DeConcini returned the campaign contributions . </s>
<s> The senator 's spokesman said yesterday that he pushed for the sale of Lincoln because `` hundreds of Arizona jobs -LCB- at Lincoln -RCB- were on the line . '' </s>
<s> Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald Riegle -LRB- D. , Mich . -RRB- has also returned contributions he received from Mr. Keating a year ago . </s>
<s> Sens. John Glenn -LRB- D. , Ohio -RRB- , John McCain , -LRB- R. , Ariz. -RRB- and Alan Cranston -LRB- D. , Calif. -RRB- also received substantial contributions from Mr. Keating and sought to intervene on behalf of Lincoln . </s>
<s> House Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez -LRB- D. , Texas -RRB- said Sen. Cranston volunteered to appear before the House committee , if necessary . </s>
<s> But a committee staff member said the panel is unlikely to pursue closely the role of the senators . </s>
<s> At the hearing , Mr. Seidman said the RTC has already pumped $ 729 million into Lincoln for liquidity . </s>
<s> He also held out little hope of restitution for purchasers of $ 225 million in American Continental subordinated debt . </s>
<s> Some of those debtholders have filed a suit , saying they believed they were buying government-insured certificates of deposit . </s>
<s> `` We have no plans at this time to pay off those notes , '' he said . </s>
