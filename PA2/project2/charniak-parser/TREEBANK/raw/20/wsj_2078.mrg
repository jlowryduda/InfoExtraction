<s> An experimental vaccine can alter the immune response of people infected with the AIDS virus , a prominent U.S. scientist said . </s>
<s> However , that does n't mean they can benefit from the vaccine . </s>
<s> Its effectiveness ca n't be determined until a large clinical trial is undertaken by the Army in January , according to Robert Redfield , chief of acquired immune deficiency syndrome research at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research . </s>
<s> Dr. Redfield 's report on early experiments using an AIDS vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of West Haven , Conn. , came at a meeting of AIDS vaccine researchers in Florida late Monday . </s>
<s> The vaccine , VaxSyn HIV-1 , has been safely given to 14 people , some of whom are experiencing substantial increases in certain antibodies . </s>
<s> `` The conventional wisdom used to be that you could n't modify the immune response of an infected individual '' by innoculating them with synthetic viral proteins , Dr. Redfield said . </s>
<s> `` We 've demonstrated that you can . '' </s>
<s> He said certain volunteers developed kinds of antibodies associated with early AIDS . </s>
<s> Other antibodies sparked by the preparation are of a sort rarely present in large quantities in infected or ill individuals , he added . </s>
<s> One of the mysteries of AIDS remains why infected people produce large quantities of antibodies , but deteriorate nonetheless . </s>
