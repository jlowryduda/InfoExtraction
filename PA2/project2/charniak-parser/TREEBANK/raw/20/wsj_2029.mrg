<s> This is written to correct a misquotation in your Oct. 3 article `` Deaths From Advanced Colon Cancer Can Be Reduced by Using Two Drugs . '' </s>
<s> In this article , I was alleged to have said , `` Any patient with high-risk colon cancer is really getting short shrift if he 's not getting this therapy . '' </s>
<s> I did n't say this , and I 'm totally opposed to the philosophy expressed by the quote . </s>
<s> I have not offered and will not offer routine therapy with the two drugs , levamisole and 5-fluorouracil , to any of my colon-cancer patients . </s>
<s> With this treatment we have reduced deaths in high-risk colon cancer by one-third -- but this leaves the two-thirds who are dying of cancer . </s>
<s> This is not nearly good enough . </s>
<s> I believe any physician who truly cares about cancer patients , both today and tomorrow , should offer the hope of something better than that . </s>
<s> My statement , read verbatim from a printed text available to all reporters attending the National Cancer Institute news conference , was the following : `` New clinical trials are already in operation seeking to improve these results . </s>
<s> These research protocols offer to the patient not only the very best therapy which we have established today but also the hope of something still better . </s>
<s> I feel any patient with high-risk cancer is getting short shrift if he is not offered this opportunity . '' </s>
<s> We have very exciting prospects for far more impressive advances in the treatment of colon cancer during the years immediately ahead . </s>
<s> This hope , however , will never be realized if we use levamisole and 5-fluorouracil as a stopping point . </s>
