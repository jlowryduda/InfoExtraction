<s> When the Soviets announced their last soldier had left Afghanistan in February , the voices of skepticism were all but drowned out by an international chorus of euphoria . </s>
<s> It was `` the Soviets ' Vietnam . '' </s>
<s> The Kabul regime would fall . </s>
<s> Millions of refugees would rush home . </s>
<s> A resistance government would walk into Kabul . </s>
<s> Those who bought that illusion are now bewildered . </s>
<s> Eight months after Gen. Boris Gromov walked across the bridge into the U.S.S.R. , a Soviet-controlled regime remains in Kabul , the refugees sit in their camps , and the restoration of Afghan freedom seems as far off as ever . </s>
<s> But there never was a chance that the Afghan resistance would overthrow the Kabul regime quickly and easily . </s>
<s> Soviet leaders said they would support their Kabul clients by all means necessary -- and did . </s>
<s> The U.S. said it would fully support the resistance -- and did n't . </s>
<s> With the February 1987 U.N. accords `` relating to Afghanistan , '' the Soviet Union got everything it needed to consolidate permanent control . </s>
<s> The terms of the Geneva accords leave Moscow free to provide its clients in Kabul with assistance of any kind -- including the return of Soviet ground forces -- while requiring the U.S. and Pakistan to cut off aid . </s>
<s> The only fly in the Soviet ointment was the last-minute addition of a unilateral American caveat , that U.S. aid to the resistance would continue as long as Soviet aid to Kabul did . </s>
<s> But as soon as the accords were signed , American officials sharply reduced aid . </s>
<s> In February 1989 , when the Soviets said they had completed their pullout , the U.S. cut it further . </s>
<s> Not so the Soviets . </s>
<s> Gen. Gromov himself said Soviet troops expected to leave behind more than $ 1 billion of military equipment and installations for the Kabul regime . </s>
<s> Since the troop withdrawal , Moscow has poured in an additional $ 200 to $ 300 million worth per month -- nearly $ 2 billion since February , equivalent to the total U.S. aid to the resistance in nine years . </s>
<s> This includes what Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov fetchingly called `` new peaceful long-range weapons , '' including more than 800 SCUD missiles . </s>
<s> By early May , Moscow had delivered , for example , 1,000 trucks , about 100 tanks , artillery and hundreds of other combat vehicles . </s>
<s> Later that month , it added an entire tank brigade , including 120 T-72 tanks and more than 40 BMP state-of-the-art infantry fighting vehicles . </s>
<s> By September , a new Reinforced Motorized Rifle Brigade with an additional 300 combat vehicles , 1,000 more trucks and 10,000 Soviet-trained Afghan troops had arrived in Kandahar . </s>
<s> In the last few weeks , Moscow has added FROG-7B missiles , the bomber version of the An-12 , MiG-23BN high-altitude aircraft , MiG-29s , which can outfly Pakistan 's U.S.-built F16s , and Sukhoi SU-27 fighter-bombers , which can outfly the MiG-29s . </s>
<s> Moscow claims this is all needed to protect the Kabul regime against the guerrilla resistance . </s>
<s> It is well-known that the regular Afghan infantry is filled with reluctant conscripts . </s>
<s> But this is not the entire Afghan army , and it is no longer Kabul 's only military force . </s>
<s> Complete units have been trained and indoctrinated in the U.S.S.R. and other East bloc nations ; 30,000 to 40,000 of these troops have returned . </s>
<s> In addition , the regime has established well-paid paramilitary forces totaling more than 100,000 , including 35,000 Soviet-trained troops of the Interior Ministry -LRB- KHAD\/WAD -RRB- , which still is directed by 1,500 Soviet KGB officers . </s>
<s> Even if not all these forces are committed to the regime , they are now dependent on it . </s>
<s> And thousands of Afghan children have been taken to the Soviet Union , where they are hostage for the behavior of their families . </s>
<s> Since 1981 , Indian military advisers have been assisting the Kabul regime . </s>
<s> In preparation for the withdrawal , Moscow , Kabul and New Delhi signed two agreements for several hundred newly civilian Indian experts to replace some of the more visible Soviet military personnel . </s>
<s> Cuban military personnel also have been active in Afghanistan since 1979 . </s>
<s> The Soviets cut a deal with Iran : a future Iranian role in Afghanistan in exchange for Iranian support of Soviet policy . </s>
<s> The deal was symbolized by the restoration of the Shi'ite Sultan Ali Keshtmand to the Afghan prime ministry . </s>
<s> Moreover , serious questions have been raised about the claimed withdrawal of Soviet forces . </s>
<s> Before his assassination in 1988 , President Zia of Pakistan repeatedly stated that fresh Soviet troops were being inserted into Afghanistan even as others were ostentatiously withdrawn . </s>
<s> Rep. Bill McCollum -LRB- R. , Fla. -RRB- reports that these included 20,000 to 30,000 Soviet Central Asian KGB Border Guards , ethnically indistinguishable from Afghans and wearing unmarked uniforms . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , the Kabul regime is increasingly successful at portraying the resistance as bloody-minded fanatics . </s>
<s> In this they are aided by years of American , European , Pakistani and Saudi support for the most extreme factions -- radical Islamic fanatics with leaders whose policies are anathema to the Afghan public . </s>
<s> This heavy outside support for the worst has undermined better , moderate leaders . </s>
<s> In autumn last year , for example , the regime garrison at Kandahar was prepared to surrender the city to resistance moderates . </s>
<s> At the last minute , however , Pakistani officials sent in Gulbuddin Hekhmatyar , perhaps the most hated and feared of the extremists , with a demand that the surrender be made to his forces . </s>
<s> The deal fell through , and Kandahar remains a major regime base . </s>
<s> The resistance lacks not only air power , armor and expertise but often such essentials as maps , mine detectors , or even winter gloves . </s>
<s> Experienced resistance commanders wanted to use guerrilla action and siege tactics to wear down the regime . </s>
<s> Instead , they were pressured by Pakistan 's ISI , the channel for their support , into attacking Jalalabad . </s>
<s> They took more than 25 % casualties ; journalists report that they faced minefields without mine detectors . </s>
<s> The wonder is not that the resistance has failed to topple the Kabul regime , but that it continues to exist and fight at all . </s>
<s> Last summer , in response to congressional criticism , the State Department and the CIA said they had resumed military aid to the resistance months after it was cut off ; but it is not clear how much is being sent or when it will arrive . </s>
<s> For months the resistance has been defenseless against air attack . </s>
<s> Thus far there is no indication that they have been re-supplied with Stingers or other anti-aircraft weapons . </s>
<s> Indeed , U.S. officials have indicated to the press that the continuation of aid depends on what success the weakened resistance achieves by the end of this year . </s>
<s> Moscow and Kabul must have found that information useful . </s>
<s> For a decade U.S. policy has been incoherent , based on miscalculation and the defense of bureaucratic and political turf . </s>
<s> No settlement negotiated by others can force the Afghan people to give up their struggle . </s>
<s> A cutoff of U.S. military aid would merely abandon them to die in vain . </s>
<s> Creation of a new , realistic U.S. policy is long overdue . </s>
