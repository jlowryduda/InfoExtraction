<s> Spooked investors , despite their stampede to dump takeover stocks , should hold on tight to their Jaguar shares . </s>
<s> That 's the view of some analysts here who argue that Britain 's leading maker of luxury cars still may have two U.S. auto giants battling for it . </s>
<s> Yesterday , Ford Motor disclosed that it has raised its holding in Jaguar to 10.4 % from 5 % . </s>
<s> Both Ford and its rival General Motors recently set their sights on grabbing significant minority stakes in the British company . </s>
<s> Ford 's latest move increases the pressure on GM to complete its current talks with Jaguar quickly . </s>
<s> GM is likely to reach the cooperative operating pact it has been seeking in about two weeks , knowledgeable individuals say . </s>
<s> At that point investors may face a long , bumpy ride . </s>
<s> A victor in the fight for Jaguar may not emerge until after the expiration late next year of British government takeover restrictions . </s>
<s> The curbs prevent a buyer from purchasing more than 15 % of Jaguar shares without permission . </s>
<s> `` This is an exceptionally odd takeover battle , '' says London analyst Christopher Will of Shearson Lehman Hutton . </s>
<s> Jaguar 's American depositary receipts were up 3\/8 yesterday in a down market , closing at 10 3\/8 . </s>
<s> -LRB- Jaguar 's ADRs make the company one of the most widely held United Kingdom stocks in the U.S. , with more than one-fourth of its shares owned there . -RRB- </s>
<s> Jaguar topped the most-active list for the U.S. over-the-counter market Monday . </s>
<s> And on London 's Stock Exchange Monday , 18.5 million shares were traded , far above the usual volume . </s>
<s> Ford 's share purchases undoubtedly accounted for much of Monday 's heavy trading . </s>
<s> Last week , many Jaguar shareholders took their money and ran . </s>
<s> Fears that Ford 's ardor might be cooling put Jaguar shares into reverse after GM confirmed its friendly negotiations with Jaguar . </s>
<s> But yesterday 's announcement indicates that Ford has n't lost interest . </s>
<s> Both Shearson 's Mr . Will and Stephen Reitman , European auto analyst at the London brokerage firm UBS-Phillips & Drew , recently switched their Jaguar recommendations to hold from buy . </s>
<s> `` Sit tight '' through the coming volatility , Mr. Reitman suggests , though he concedes that many small investors will find Jaguar 's zigzags `` too hard to swallow . '' </s>
<s> But a crucial point is how Ford reacts when GM , the world 's largest auto maker , firms up its proposed deal with Jaguar . </s>
<s> At the moment , Ford executives will say little beyond reiterating their desire to raise Ford 's Jaguar stake to about 15 % . </s>
<s> GM is expected to inject roughly # 200 million -LRB- $ 316 million -RRB- by acquiring some Jaguar shares , and then win Jaguar management 's promise of an eventual 30 % stake . </s>
<s> Analysts believe the car makers also will create joint ventures to develop new executive models , doubling Jaguar 's yearly output of 50,000 cars . </s>
<s> Jaguar shareholders would have to bless such a far-reaching accord . </s>
<s> Ford might challenge the proposal by offering a full bid if holders and the U.K. government agreed to drop the anti-takeover barrier early . </s>
<s> `` I think Ford is going to come out with full guns blazing , '' Mr. Reitman says . </s>
<s> `` Ford wants -LCB- Jaguar -RCB- very much . '' </s>
<s> U.S. takeover-stock speculators , who may own between 20 % and 30 % of Jaguar , could give Ford enough votes to block the GM deal . </s>
<s> GM might counterbid . </s>
<s> Then , Mr . Will says , `` you get a bidding war between two very rich , very determined international companies . '' </s>
<s> He believes Jaguar 's share price could zoom to between # 8 and # 10 -LRB- $ 12.60 to $ 15.80 -RRB- . </s>
<s> `` There 's quite a bit of value left in the -LCB- Jaguar -RCB- shares here even though they have run up '' lately , says Doug Johnson , a fund manager for Seattle-based Safeco Asset Management . </s>
<s> At the moment , he intends to keep the firm 's 180,000 Jaguar shares . </s>
<s> The risk is that Jaguar 's share price could slump if GM 's agreement with Jaguar effectively locks out its U.S. rival . </s>
<s> `` Ford 's appetite to attack -LCB- Jaguar -RCB- could gradually wane over time , particularly if Saab is a reasonably attractive proposition , '' says John Lawson , an auto analyst at London 's Nomura Research Institute . </s>
<s> He thinks Saab-Scania AB on Friday will announce the sale of 50 % of its car division to Ford ; the companies have been discussing closer cooperation for months . </s>
<s> Clifford Stahl , president and chief investment officer of C-S Capital Advisors Inc. , two weeks ago sold his Cincinnati firm 's 107,100 Jaguar ADRs at about 10 each , making a tidy profit on a holding purchased at 4 7\/8 in early May . </s>
