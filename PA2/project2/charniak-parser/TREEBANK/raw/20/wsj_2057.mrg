<s> Why is the stock market suddenly so volatile ? </s>
<s> Yesterday , the Dow Jones Industrial Average did a now familiar dance : It plunged 60.25 points before lunch , with most of the drop occurring in 25 minutes . </s>
<s> Then , it rebounded to finish down only 18.65 points . </s>
<s> And those swings paled beside Friday 's 190.58-point plunge and Monday 's 88.12-point recovery . </s>
<s> `` It 's madness -- that in an hour you can whack off so much value , '' says Stanford Calderwood , chairman of Trinity Investment Management Corp. , Boston . </s>
<s> And , apparently , it is here to stay . </s>
<s> Richard Bernstein , senior quantitative analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co , says , `` My gut feel is that we 'll live with those swings for a while . '' </s>
<s> There are many reasons for the market 's jumpiness : new trading vehicles such as stock-index futures and options ; computer-driven strategies like program trading ; and crowd psychology . </s>
<s> But most are linked by a single theme : liquidity -- the ability to get in and out of the market quickly . </s>
<s> Prices are moving up and down so fast because investors are employing ways to turn over shares at ever-faster rates and increasingly acting in concert . </s>
<s> `` Institutions are herding animals , '' says Peter Anderson , who heads the pension-fund management arm of IDS Financial Services Inc . </s>
<s> `` We watch the same indicators and listen to the same prognosticators . </s>
<s> Like lemmings , we tend to move in the same direction at same time . '' </s>
<s> And that , naturally , exacerbates price movements . </s>
<s> Institutions -- who now account for most trading -- count on being able to buy and sell big blocks of stock at an eye-blink . </s>
<s> But when they discover that markets are n't always as liquid as they supposed -- markets jump . </s>
<s> On Monday , for instance , Howard Ward , a principal at Scudder , Stevens & Clark , found that `` you could n't buy blue-chips at quoted prices without paying up . '' </s>
<s> And when many firms had to `` pay up , '' Monday 's sudden rally was sparked . </s>
<s> Trading in futures and options , some people believe , can add to volatility . </s>
<s> Investors believe they can can rely on such derivative securities to get in and out of the stock market without actually selling any stocks ; that is , a way of staying liquid even when they own stocks . </s>
<s> These and other modern trading methods `` tend to promote dramatic shifts in assets , '' says George Douglas , first vice president at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc . </s>
<s> `` It 's the idea that what goes in easy can come out easy '' -- so that bouts of higher volatility get built into the stock market . </s>
<s> One new investment style called `` asset allocation '' shifts portfolio weightings between stocks , bonds and cash when computer models say one is more attractive . </s>
<s> For instance , First Quadrant Corp. , an asset allocator based in Morristown , N.J. , said it quickly boosted stock positions in its `` aggressive '' accounts to 75 % from 55 % to take advantage of plunging prices Friday . </s>
<s> It added another 5 % Monday before stocks rallied . </s>
<s> When they did , the firm reduced those stock holdings to about 70 % . </s>
<s> A classic example of institutions ' hunger for liquidity is portfolio insurance , now widely discredited . </s>
<s> Before the 1987 crash , an estimated $ 60 billion in institutional money was managed under this hedging technique . </s>
<s> The idea was to `` insure '' the value of a portfolio by selling futures when stock prices dropped -- eliminating the need to sell the stocks themselves . </s>
<s> But in October 1987 , when portfolio insurers rushed to sell at the same time , they overwhelmed both the stock and futures markets . </s>
<s> Yet even today , institutions are quietly practicing forms of portfolio insurance by nervously rushing to and fro in the markets . </s>
<s> Others are doing `` index arbitrage '' a strategy of taking advantage of price discrepancies between stocks and futures . </s>
<s> Unlike traditional buy-and-hold strategies , all of the above require that market makers be on hand to provide liquidity by buying and selling stocks in a crunch . </s>
<s> But institutions say Wall Street brokerage firms are less willing to make markets . </s>
<s> Brokers do n't deny that . </s>
<s> Wall Street traders say that , with institutional brokerage commissions far lower than in the 1970s , securities firms ca n't afford to take the risk of buying too much stock . </s>
<s> `` I think everyone 's a little more leery , '' says Jack Baker , head of equity trading at Shearon Lehman Hutton Inc . </s>
<s> `` The institutions have driven -LRB- commission -RRB- rates down to the point where it makes no sense to commit capital , '' says Tom Gallagher , senior executive vice president in charge of institutional trading at Oppenheimer & Co . </s>
<s> `` Why should I risk money for a guy for who 's paying me five cents a dance ? </s>
<s> All you get is risk . '' </s>
<s> Lack of liquidity can also result from exchange `` reforms . '' </s>
<s> Many traders say that `` circuit breakers '' put in place to damp volatility after the 1987 crash actually added to volatility when the stock market plunged Friday . </s>
<s> The circuit breakers caused a 30-minute shutdown in trading in Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index futures contract as the markets were falling . </s>
<s> `` With the futures-trading halt , you could only sell stocks '' to cut exposure to the market , says a money manager . </s>
<s> `` It was scary to people thinking that they could n't get their trades off . '' </s>
<s> `` It was like they put you in a room with a gorilla and told you there were three doors to exit , '' said one Chicago-based futures trader . </s>
<s> `` Then they said , ` By the way , two of the doors are locked . ' '' </s>
<s> The takeover mania also adds to volatility . </s>
<s> UAL Corp. is a good example . </s>
<s> Valued as a buy-out target , the airline stock was trading at nearly $ 280 a share . </s>
<s> When the deal ran into trouble , the stock tumbled ; it closed at $ 198 yesterday . </s>
<s> Presumably , UAL is now trading closer to its value based on earnings . </s>
<s> By contrast , traditional buy-and-hold investors are unlikely to generate sudden price moves . </s>
<s> Scott Black , a value-oriented money manager who heads Delphi Management Inc. , points out that for those who invest on fundamentals , `` the value of a stock from day to day does n't change all that much . '' </s>
<s> Some experts say markets are n't as volatile as widely assumed . </s>
<s> Hans Stoll , finance professor at Vanderbilt University , says the current volatility in U.S. markets pales in comparison to the 1930s , decades before derivative instruments such as options and futures were introduced . </s>
<s> `` I just ca n't believe that the innovations in the financial market are causing any of this volatility , '' he says . </s>
<s> And Robert D. Arnott , president of asset allocator First Quadrant , notes that before Friday 's tailspin , daily volatility on the New York Stock Exchange in recent weeks had reached `` historically low levels . '' </s>
<s> Some people tend to ignore that a 50-point move is less in percentage terms than it was when the stock market was lower . </s>
<s> John J. Phelan Jr. , chairman of the Big Board , asserts that `` 1988 and 1989 have been two of the least volatile years in the last 30 or 40 years . '' </s>
<s> But the low average volatility Mr. Phelan is talking about is n't any comfort in a period of rapid stock-market moves like the past week . </s>
<s> In addition , Sanford Grossman , a Wharton School finance professor , says volatile jumps in stock prices will continue as long as liquidity falls short of the voracious demands of institutions `` who can go out and say ` I have a billion dollars of stocks to sell . ' '' </s>
<s> Some people think the search for liquidity is fruitless . </s>
<s> In 1936 , John Maynard Keynes wrote that `` of the maxims of orthodox finance none , surely , is more antisocial than the fetish of liquidity . '' </s>
<s> It leads investors to focus on short-term price movements -- `` a game of musical chairs , '' he called it -- rather than on long-term fundamental valuation . </s>
