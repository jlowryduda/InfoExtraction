<s> Nothing stirred the soul of Ronald Reagan and his disciples as much as the crusade to aid Nicaragua 's Contra rebels , or the dream of building a space-based defense shield to knock out Soviet nuclear missiles . </s>
<s> Yet under Mr. Reagan 's preferred successor , President Bush , those two cherished national-security causes are withering on the vine . </s>
<s> And , surprisingly , little more than a whimper of protest is being heard , even though Reaganauts once breathed fire supporting the Contras and the Strategic Defense Initiative . </s>
<s> `` The programs have arthritis , '' says Rep. Henry Hyde , a conservative Republican from Illinois . </s>
<s> Yet , he asserts , `` you look around ... and you say , ` Who are the leaders ? </s>
<s> Who is going to carry the water ? ' '' </s>
<s> It is n't surprising that President Bush has n't led a crusade to pump up the Contras or SDI . </s>
<s> Though he nominally supports both programs , Mr. Bush has n't been a passionate champion of either cause , as Mr. Reagan was . </s>
<s> What 's surprising is that there is n't more of a conservative outcry as the Bush administration lets the programs slip down the national-priority list . </s>
<s> A combination of factors -- a weariness among some conservatives , a decline in the perception of a Soviet threat and a preoccupation with other issues -- seem to explain the strange tranquility . </s>
<s> Above all , though , conservative Republicans who have championed both the Contras and SDI are reluctant to attack a Republican president for failing to do more -- though that reluctance may be receding . </s>
<s> `` We want to complain , we want to say something about it , and we 're going to as it gets worse , '' says Rep. Dan Burton , an Indiana Republican who has been a staunch Contra backer . </s>
<s> `` But it 's like kicking your father in the pants . </s>
<s> You hate to do it because he 's your father . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Burton says conservatives ' unhappiness with Mr. Bush 's cautious handling of the recent unsuccessful coup in Panama will make them more willing to speak out . </s>
<s> Of course , neither President Bush nor the Congress has actually abandoned the Contras or SDI . </s>
<s> Mr. Bush has struck a deal with congressional leaders to provide nonlethal aid to the Contras until Nicaragua holds national elections next February . </s>
<s> But the administration has dropped any effort to win military aid for the rebels . </s>
<s> And the administration 's deal with Congress gives several congressional committees the right to cut off even humanitarian aid next month , though the committees are likely to let aid continue until February . </s>
<s> Most analysts think there 's little prospect the Contras can be a significant fighting force without U.S. arms , and after the February election their future in any form will be murky at best . </s>
<s> Instead of focusing on the Contras , Mr. Bush has switched to urging members of Congress -- most recently in a White House meeting yesterday -- to approve financing for the election campaign of political opponents of Nicaragua 's Sandinista government . </s>
<s> The administration continues to support SDI , or Star Wars , and it recently lobbied to persuade the Senate to restore some of the funds it planned to cut from the program . </s>
<s> And just last week , Defense Secretary Dick Cheney gave a strong speech listing `` compelling reasons '' to push ahead with SDI and saying he 'd urge President Bush to veto a defense bill with `` inadequate '' funding for the program . </s>
<s> But the strong pitch by Mr. Cheney may be too little too late to prevent damage to SDI . </s>
<s> The House has already voted for a deep cut in funding , and in the end the program 's backers will be hard pressed to head off some reduction in spending next year . </s>
<s> And while the defense secretary is speaking out , President Bush himself has n't launched any high-visibility campaign to drum up support , as President Reagan did . </s>
<s> The administration also acknowledges that it is n't pursuing Mr. Reagan 's original vision of an `` impenetrable shield '' protecting the whole U.S. , but rather a more modest version . </s>
<s> More ominous to SDI supporters , the Bush administration appears to have tacitly accepted a new arms-control proposal from the Soviet Union that spells long-term trouble for Star Wars . </s>
<s> The Soviets have agreed to complete a treaty cutting strategic weapons without including restrictions on space-based defenses . </s>
<s> But the Soviets also are insisting that they will reserve the right to withdraw from the completed strategic-arms treaty later on if the U.S. does SDI testing or deployment that the Soviets think violates the existing anti-ballistic-missile treaty . </s>
<s> It will be hard down the road to persuade Congress to approve money for SDI plans if lawmakers fear those plans could scuttle a completed treaty . </s>
<s> As a result , Frank Gaffney , a former Reagan Pentagon aide who now heads the Center for Security Policy , charges that the administration 's `` professions of continued commitment to development and deployment of the SDI program strain credulity . '' </s>
<s> Still , proponents may be shying away from more drumbeating because they sense political tides have turned against arming the Nicaraguan rebels or boosting spending on SDI -- particularly when the public perceives the Soviet threat is declining under Mikhail Gorbachev . </s>
<s> In fact , because communism seems to be beating a global retreat , some conservatives may simply be so pleased that their anti-communist philosophy is prevailing that they do n't have the fire at the moment to push controversial programs . </s>
<s> `` The short of it is that the most hard-bitten among us can not get into too sour a mood with communism collapsing , '' says Mitchell Daniels , a former Reagan White House aide who now is president of the Hudson Institute . </s>
<s> Some activists are toiling to raise the profile of the two causes . </s>
<s> But they say they ca n't make much headway because of a lack of willing leaders in a position to turn the tide . </s>
<s> One longtime champion of these programs in Congress , Republican whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia , is distracted by questions about his ethics , conservatives note . </s>
<s> Other conservative champions , like Wyoming Republican Sen. Malcolm Wallop , a longtime SDI advocate , do n't have the clout with the Bush White House that they enjoyed with President Reagan . </s>
<s> Above all , though , proponents say neither the Contra nor the SDI cause can be pushed much further without more presidential support . </s>
<s> `` For there to be wind in the sails of any program , the chief executive has to be blowing in the sails , '' says Rep. Burton . </s>
<s> All this causes Rep. Hyde to muse about an alternate way to drum up more enthusiasm . </s>
<s> `` What I 'd like to see , if he is up to it , is for Reagan to take to the hustings to regenerate enthusiasm for SDI , '' the congressman says . </s>
