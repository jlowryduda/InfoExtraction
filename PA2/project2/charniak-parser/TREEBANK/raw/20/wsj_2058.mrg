<s> The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said a computer virus has infected one of its networks and is spreading anti-nuclear messages related to its Galileo space probe , which is to be launched today . </s>
<s> Charles Redmond , a NASA spokesman , said the agency discovered the virus on Monday on the collection of computer networks collectively called Internet and expected 100 university centers to be infected by today . </s>
<s> Although the network is n't connected to the computer systems that operate either Galileo or the shuttle , part of the network will carry analyses of Galileo data once the craft gets spaceborn . </s>
<s> Mr. Redmond said the intruder had n't yet done any harm but the agency feared `` garbage data could be substituted for real data . '' </s>
<s> He estimated it could take a day for a computer security manager to expunge the virus from a computer system . </s>
<s> The intruder , among the broadest yet to hit a research network , appeared to affect only Digital Equipment Corp. hardware that uses Digital 's VAX\/VMS operating system . </s>
<s> It is unrelated to the much-publicized virus that last year infected Arpanet , a much larger network used by researchers at universities , laboratories and government agencies around the world . </s>
<s> In the lingo of computer security , the NASA intruder is technically a computer worm , Mr. Redmond said . </s>
<s> A worm resides in the operating system of a computer and spreads by boring into other computers contacted through networks . </s>
<s> The Galileo worm apparently was hatched on a computer in France hooked up to NASA 's Space Physics Analysis Network , Mr. Redmond said . </s>
<s> NASA said the Galileo worm had n't affected its computers or the computers of other government agencies because they had modified their systems to reject worms . </s>
<s> But Mr. Redmond said the worm hit universities that had n't elected to make the changes . </s>
<s> Michael Alexander , a senior editor at Computerworld , a trade publication , said he was told that the worm gets into a computer center by looking for obvious passwords -- such as ones that are the same as the user 's name . </s>
<s> If it finds one and gets into the system , it will display a screen when a user logs on that says , `` Worms Against Nuclear Killers ... . </s>
<s> You talk of times of peace for all , and then prepare for war . '' </s>
<s> In addition , Mr. Alexander said , the worm sends strange messages to other machines at the center -- such as , `` George Orwell was an optimist , '' or `` Do n't feed the bats tonight . '' </s>
<s> The worm also looks for elementary passwords that confer more privileges on the user . </s>
<s> The passwords are included in the system software when it is installed but are supposed to be replaced as soon as the system is up and running . </s>
<s> If it finds one of those passwords , Mr. Alexander said , the worm will do such things as change users ' passwords to a series of random numbers , preventing them from signing on to the network . </s>
<s> NASA estimated that , on Monday , about four computer centers were affected . </s>
<s> Yesterday , the number grew to 40 ; today the number is expected to grow to 100 . </s>
<s> NASA said it will take about a week before it knows exactly how many centers of the 6,000 connected to Internet were affected and the extent of the damage , if any . </s>
<s> Anti-nuclear activists have protested the launch of the Galileo space probe to Jupiter because it uses plutonium to generate the electricity needed to run the craft . </s>
<s> Activists fear that if the shuttle carrying Galileo into orbit should explode , or if Galileo itself crashes into the Earth during the two times it flies close to the planet , fatal levels of plutonium would be released into the atmosphere . </s>
<s> So far Galileo has been delayed twice , once because of a computer malfunction connected with a space-shuttle engine , and yesterday because of the weather . </s>
<s> NASA said the Galileo worm had nothing to do with either delay . </s>
<s> Mr. Alexander of Computerworld said hackers have gone after SPAN before . </s>
<s> He said the Chaos Computer Club , of West Germany , once managed to invade SPAN and do such things as change the value of pi , messing up some calculations . </s>
