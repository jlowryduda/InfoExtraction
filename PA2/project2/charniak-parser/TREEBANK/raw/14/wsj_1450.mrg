<s> The Bakersfield Supermarket went out of business last May . </s>
<s> The reason was not high interest rates or labor costs . </s>
<s> Nor was there a shortage of customers in the area , the residential Inwood section of northern Manhattan . </s>
<s> The business closed when the owner was murdered by robbers . </s>
<s> The owner was Israel Ortiz , a 29-year-old entrepreneur and father of two . </s>
<s> In his first year of operating the store he bought for $ 220,000 , Mr. Ortiz was robbed at least twice at gunpoint . </s>
<s> The first time he was shot in the hand as he chased the robbers outside . </s>
<s> The second time he identified two robbers , who were arrested and charged . </s>
<s> Two weeks later -- perhaps in retaliation -- Mr. Ortiz was shot three times in the back , during what police classified as a third robbery attempt . </s>
<s> That was his reward for working until 11 p.m. seven days a week to cover his $ 3,000 a month rent . </s>
<s> For providing what his customers described as very personal and helpful service . </s>
<s> For creating a focus for neighborhood life . </s>
<s> Israel Ortiz is only one of the thousands of entrepreneurs and their employees who will be injured or killed by crime this year . </s>
<s> The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that almost 2 % of all retail-sales workers suffer injuries from crime each year , almost twice the national average and about four times the rate for teachers , truck drivers , medical workers and door-to-door salespeople . </s>
<s> Only a few other occupations have higher reported rates of criminal injury , such as police , bartenders and taxi drivers . </s>
<s> Yet these figures show only the most visible part of the problem . </s>
<s> Recent data from New York City provide more of the picture . </s>
<s> While by no means the highest crime community in the country , New York is a prime example of a city where crime strangles small-business development . </s>
<s> A survey of small businesses there was conducted this spring by Interface , a policy research organization . </s>
<s> It gave 1,124 businesses a questionnaire and analyzed 353 responses . </s>
<s> The survey found that over a three-year period 22 % of the firms said employees or owners had been robbed on their way to or from work or while on the job . </s>
<s> Seventeen percent reported their customers being robbed . </s>
<s> Crime was the reason that 26 % reported difficulty recruiting personnel and that 19 % said they were considering moving . </s>
<s> More than one-third of the responding businesses said they suffer from drug dealing and loitering near their premises . </s>
<s> In Brooklyn and the Bronx , one out of four commercial firms is burglarized each year . </s>
<s> Industrial neighborhoods fare even worse , with burglary rates twice the citywide average . </s>
<s> Crime is clearly more deadly to small-scale entrepreneurship than to big businesses . </s>
<s> Two decades ago , the Small Business Administration reported Yale Prof. Albert Reiss 's landmark study of crime against 2,500 small businesses drawn from national IRS records . </s>
<s> He found that monetary crime losses , as a proportion of gross receipts , were 37 times higher for small businesses than for large ones . </s>
<s> The New York study 's companies averaged 27 employees ; their annual crime losses averaged about $ 15,000 , with an additional $ 8,385 annual cost in security -- enough money to hire at least one more worker . </s>
<s> The costs of crime may also be enough to destroy a struggling business . </s>
<s> Whatever the monetary crime losses , they may not be nearly as important to entrepreneurs as the risk of personal injury . </s>
<s> After repeated gun robberies , some entrepreneurs may give up a business out of fear for their lives . </s>
<s> One Washington couple recently sold their liquor store after 34 years in business that included four robbery deaths and 16 robberies or burglaries on the premises . </s>
<s> These findings illustrate the vicious cycle that National Institute of Justice Director James K. Stewart calls `` crime causing poverty . '' </s>
<s> Underclass neighborhoods offer relatively few employment opportunities , contributing to the poverty of local residents . </s>
<s> Small neighborhood businesses could provide more jobs , if crime were not so harmful to creating and maintaining those businesses . </s>
<s> This may help explain why small businesses create 65 % of all jobs nationally , but only 22 % of jobs in a crime-ridden city like New York . </s>
<s> Bigger business can often better afford to minimize the cost of crime . </s>
<s> The New York study found that the cost of security measures in firms with fewer than five employees was almost $ 1,000 per worker , compared with one-third that amount for firms with more than 10 employees . </s>
<s> The shift of retailing to large shopping centers has created even greater economies of scale for providing low-crime business environments . </s>
<s> Private security guards and moonlighting police can invoke the law of trespass to regulate access to these quasi-public places . </s>
<s> Since 1984 , in fact , revenues of the 10 largest guard companies , primarily serving such big businesses , have increased by almost 62 % . </s>
<s> Few small neighborhood businesses , however , can afford such protection , even in collaboration with other local merchants . </s>
<s> In the neighborhoods with the highest crime rates , small business generally relies on the public police force for protection . </s>
<s> This creates several problems . </s>
<s> One is that there are not enough police to satisfy small businesses . </s>
<s> The number one proposal for reducing crime in the New York survey was to put more police on foot or scooter patrol , suggested by more than two-thirds of the respondents . </s>
<s> Only 22 % supported private security patrols funded by the merchants themselves . </s>
<s> A second problem is the persistent frustration of false alarms , which can make urban police less than enthusiastic about responding to calls from small businesses . </s>
<s> Only half the New York small businesses surveyed , for their part , are satisfied with the police response they receive . </s>
<s> Some cities , including New York , have experimented with special tax districts for commercial areas that provide additional patrols funded by local businesses . </s>
<s> But this raises added cost barriers to urban entrepreneurship . </s>
<s> Another solution cities might consider is giving special priority to police patrols of small-business areas . </s>
<s> For cities losing business to suburban shopping centers , it may be a wise business investment to help keep those jobs and sales taxes within city limits . </s>
<s> Increased patrolling of business zones makes sense because urban crime is heavily concentrated in such `` hot spots '' of pedestrian density . </s>
<s> With National Institute of Justice support , the Minneapolis police and the Crime Control Institute are currently testing the effects of such a strategy , comparing its deterrence value with traditional random patrols . </s>
<s> Small-business patrols would be an especially helpful gesture whenever a small-business person is scheduled to testify against a robbery suspect . </s>
<s> While no guarantee , an increased police presence might even deter further attacks . </s>
<s> It might even have saved the life , and business , of Israel Ortiz . </s>
<s> Mr. Sherman is a professor of criminology at the University of Maryland and president of the Crime Control Institute in Washington , D.C . </s>
