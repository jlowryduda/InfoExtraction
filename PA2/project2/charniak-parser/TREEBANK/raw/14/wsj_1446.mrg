<s> Move over , pornographic phone services : A legal service with a `` 900 '' number has been launched in California . </s>
<s> A Newport Beach law firm started the pay-as-you-go legal service , called Telelawyer , using MCI Communication Corp. 's toll-tele-phone service . </s>
<s> Cane & Associates touts its $ 2-a-minute service as the `` cheapest legal hour you 'll ever find . '' </s>
<s> Though the service is available only in California , Telelawyer founder Michael Cane says he plans to franchise it in other states . </s>
<s> He says his aim is to reach people who are bedridden , have no access to transportation , ca n't find a lawyer to take their case or simply ca n't afford lawyers ' consultation fees . </s>
<s> Mr. Cane stresses that he is n't using the telephone to lure clients to his doorstep . </s>
<s> `` We will only deal with clients on the phone , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` We have no in-office business . '' </s>
<s> Telelawyer is apparently the only telephone service that offers the telephone equivalent of an office visit . </s>
<s> Local bar associations in some states have numbers that provide free tape-recorded messages explaining certain areas of the law . </s>
<s> There also are `` 800 '' hotlines which refer people to lawyers , usually personal-injury specialists , for in-office consultation . </s>
<s> When a caller reaches Telelawyer by dialing 900-TELELAW , a receptionist refers the call to one of six attorneys . </s>
<s> In an effort to determine whether a caller has reason to sue , Cane lawyers review documents and perform research , if necessary , with the help of three law clerks and several support staffers . </s>
<s> There is no charge for research -- only for time on the phone . </s>
<s> If the matter requires further legal work or litigation , Mr. Cane says , his lawyers may refer the client to a law firm . </s>
<s> But he says Cane & Associates does n't receive referral fees . </s>
<s> So far , says Mr. Cane , most calls have involved landlord-tenant problems , tax problems , divorce , and probate questions . </s>
<s> The firm is getting about 50 calls a day , and the average call lasts about 15 minutes . </s>
<s> Out of the $ 2 charge , the law firm pockets about $ 1.55 . </s>
<s> JURY CONVICTS congressman in connection with Wedtech Corp. scandal . </s>
<s> A federal court jury in New York found U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia -LRB- D. , N.Y . -RRB- and his wife , Jane Lee Garcia , guilty of extorting $ 76,000 from Wedtech in return for official acts by the congressman . </s>
<s> The jury also convicted them of extortion in obtaining a $ 20,000 , interest-free loan from a Wedtech officer . </s>
<s> The jury found them guilty of conspiracy in obtaining the payments , some of which were disguised as fees for consulting services from Mrs. Garcia . </s>
<s> Wedtech , which became embroiled in political-corruption cases that eventually led to its demise , formerly was a minority-owned South Bronx , N.Y. , defense contractor . </s>
<s> Edward J.M. Little , one of the assistant U.S. attorneys who prosecuted the case , said the Garcia trial `` is the last of the Wedtech prosecutions . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Little said more than 20 people have been convicted in the Wedtech cases , including former U.S. Rep. Mario Biaggi -LRB- D. , N.Y . -RRB- . </s>
<s> Lawyers for the Garcias said they plan to appeal . </s>
<s> Mr. Garcia , who represents New York 's 18th congressional district , which includes the Bronx , said he has n't decided whether he will resign . </s>
<s> `` In the next few weeks , I will be consulting with my political advisers and with the Democratic leaders about the best way of preserving the interests of my constituents , '' said Mr. Garcia , 56 years old . </s>
<s> Mrs. Garcia , 49 , formerly was a member of Mr. Garcia 's congressional staff . </s>
<s> The Garcias were cleared of four other felony counts , involving the receipt of bribes and gratuities . </s>
<s> U.S. Judge Leonard B. Sand set the Garcias ' sentencing for Jan. 5 . </s>
<s> FIVE SHEA & GOULD PARTNERS are leaving to form a new firm . </s>
<s> The new firm , Hutton Ingram Yuzek Gainen Carroll & Bertolotti , will be based in New York . </s>
<s> The five partners who resigned from Shea & Gould late last week are Tom Hutton , Sam Ingram , Dean Yuzek , Daniel Carroll and Ernest Bertolotti . </s>
<s> They will be joined by Larry Gainen , who resigned from the firm of LePatner , Gainen & Block . </s>
<s> Howard Rubenstein , a New York publicist who represents Shea & Gould , said , `` Shea & Gould understands they 're leaving because they wanted a different environment -- a smaller firm they would be principals of . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Rubenstein said the five , who were n't on Shea & Gould 's management committee , `` are leaving on good terms . '' </s>
<s> He said Shea & Gould held a number of discussions with the five partners during the past few weeks to get them to stay but that the five were firmly committed to running their own firm . </s>
<s> Hutton Ingram will have a general corporate , securities , real-estate and litigation practice , and a substantial practice serving the professional-design community . </s>
<s> DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS against lawyers open to public in Illinois . </s>
<s> While investigations into lawyer misconduct will remain secret , the public will be notified once a formal complaint is filed against an attorney . </s>
<s> The actual disciplinary hearings will be public . </s>
<s> In addition , Illinois attorneys will lose the right to sue clients who file malicious complaints against them . </s>
<s> Non-lawyers will be added to the inquiry panels that look into allegations of misconduct . </s>
<s> Illinois joins 36 other states that allow public participation in attorney-disciplinary proceedings and 32 states that open disciplinary hearings to the public , according to the American Bar Association . </s>
<s> One vocal critic of the changes , Chicago lawyer Warren Lupel , says non-lawyers should n't be on the inquiry panels because they are unlikely to appreciate the nuances of attorney-client relationships . </s>
<s> In addition , he says , publishing the names of lawyers who are facing charges unnecessarily subjects them to public derogation . </s>
<s> Nevertheless , Mr. Lupel anticipates no legal action to reverse the Illinois Supreme Court 's decision to institute the changes . </s>
<s> `` There 's no constitutional right involved in the rule change , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` You do n't have a right to practice . </s>
<s> You only have a privilege to practice . '' </s>

<s> The firm has said it expects to pay $ 11.5 million overall to settle with states . </s>
<s> Drexel pleaded guilty in September to six felony counts of securities and mail fraud ; it also made a $ 650 million civil settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission . </s>
