<s> If growth regains its glamour among investors , a sluggish segment of the Nasdaq over-the-counter market could show some flash . </s>
<s> Some stock pickers already are targeting the OTC market , where , they say , await plenty of small - and medium-sized growth stocks . </s>
<s> Best of all , they add , these growth issues , unlike their big blue-chip cousins on the New York Stock Exchange , are languishing at depressed prices . </s>
<s> Growth stocks will return to favor , some analysts and money managers think , because of the jitters caused by the market 's steep slide on Oct. 13 , and because of the current swell of disappointing earnings announcements . </s>
<s> Against such a backdrop , companies with proven track records of earnings gains of 20 % or so annually have extra appeal . </s>
<s> `` The market will have to look for a new theme now and that theme will be a return to growth , '' declares Mary Farrell , a PaineWebber analyst . </s>
<s> Among her OTC picks are Oshkosh B'Gosh and A&W Brands . </s>
<s> Like many OTC growth issues , they have market values -- as measured by stock price times shares outstanding -- of roughly $ 100 million to $ 500 million . </s>
<s> Some like to specialize in growth companies whose shares have n't traded publicly very long . </s>
<s> These are sometimes dubbed `` emerging '' growth companies , though they also have expanding-profit track records . </s>
<s> While many growth stocks are small , not all small stocks have earnings-growth momentum . </s>
<s> That 's an important distinction because some analysts and brokers , who perennially predict that small stocks are about to outperform bigger issues , may use any spurt in growth issues to help them sell all small stocks . </s>
<s> `` You can find some good , quality companies over the counter , '' but investors should be selective , says John Palicka , chief portfolio manager at Midco Investors , a Newark , N.J. , money management company with about $ 900 million invested in growth stocks of varying sizes . </s>
<s> Mr. Palicka 's picks from the OTC market include Legent , Mail Boxes Etc. , and Payco American . </s>
<s> The main argument for growth stocks is their usually superior performance in a slowing economy . </s>
<s> `` If the market refocuses on earnings , we should get better valuations of growth stocks , '' says L. Keith Mullins , a growth-stock analyst at Morgan Stanley . </s>
<s> Eventually , he believes , investors will be willing to pay higher prices for companies with proven track records of earnings growth . </s>
<s> In anticipation of that shift , he and other analysts are encouraging their clients to buy such issues now . </s>
<s> Understandably , smaller growth stocks have n't been in favor recently . </s>
<s> The average issue on Standard & Poor 's 500-stock Index gained 35 % last year , Ms. Farrell of PaineWebber says . </s>
<s> Smaller-stock earnings , by comparison , rose between 15 % and 20 % . </s>
<s> In addition , earnings growth took a back seat to cash flow , restructuring and takeover potential , and breakup value as the preferred stock-picking standards for much of the year . </s>
<s> Also , the smaller growth stocks are n't widely traded , and so are harder to buy and sell quickly than blue chips . </s>
<s> As a result , Morgan Stanley 's Index of 40 Emerging Growth Stocks -- most of which are in the OTC market -- is up only 13 % for the year , while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has leaped 24 % and the S&P 500 has grown 25 % . </s>
<s> The Nasdaq Composite has gained 23 % this year , but that 's largely due to the 100 largest nonfinancial stocks , which have soared 30 % . </s>
<s> Some investors are skeptical of growth stocks because investing in them means ignoring that maxim found in the fine print of some investment advertisements -- that past performance is n't indicative of future results . </s>
<s> `` People are naturally suspicious of them , '' says Mr. Mullins of Morgan Stanley . </s>
<s> Among his favorites in his firm 's index are Legent , Silicon Graphics and Novell . </s>
<s> However , more money managers are reassured that profit is regaining importance . </s>
<s> Mark Schoeppner , portfolio manager at Pittsburgh-based Quaker Capital Management , says that in reaction to nervousness about debt-laden buy-out transactions , analysts and investors now appear to be `` valuing stock based on future earnings as opposed to the amount of debt the company can support . '' </s>
<s> Barney Hallingby , managing director of research at Hambrecht & Quist , also believes earnings growth is beginning to play a greater part in investors ' buying decisions . </s>
<s> On Friday , Hambrecht & Quist added St. Jude Medical to the list of 20 stocks it strongly recommends . </s>
<s> The opinion is largely based on the company 's earnings momentum , Mr. Hallingby says . </s>
<s> St. Jude 's market value on Nasdaq exceeds $ 1 billion , so it is n't a small stock . </s>
<s> The medical devices maker 's earnings rose nearly 35 % in 1987 from 1986 , and 75 % in 1988 . </s>
<s> Kurt Kruger , who follows the stock for Hambrecht & Quist , anticipates that the company 's net income will grow 51 % to $ 2.15 a share this year . </s>
<s> St. Jude finished up 1\/4 to 44 1\/2 on Friday . </s>

<s> Sierra Tucson , an initial public offering , made the most active list . </s>
<s> The company 's shares began trading at 12 1\/2 , up from its initial offering price of 12 , and closed at 13 . </s>
<s> Sierra Tucson operates an addiction treatment center . </s>
<s> Among declining issues , a weak earnings outlook drove Groundwater Technology down 6 1\/4 to 24 . </s>
<s> The company said results for its second quarter ended Oct. 28 could drop as much as 20 % below the 30 cents a share reported in the year-earlier quarter . </s>
<s> Medstone International plummeted 3 1\/4 to 7 1\/4 . </s>

<s> McCaw said it has secured commitments from three banks to help finance its $ 125-a-share bid for 22 million of Lin 's shares . </s>
<s> McCaw has called for a `` fair auction '' of LIN , which earlier entered a stock-swap merger pact with BellSouth . </s>
