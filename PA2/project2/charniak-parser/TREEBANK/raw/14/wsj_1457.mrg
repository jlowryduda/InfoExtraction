<s> Does n't anybody here want to win this mayor 's race ? </s>
<s> As they stumble and bumble toward election day two weeks from tomorrow , both Democrat David Dinkins and Republican Rudolph Giuliani are in trouble . </s>
<s> Mr. Dinkins , the Manhattan borough president , can afford more bumbling and stumbling because he holds a comfortable 20-point lead in most of the public-opinion polls . </s>
<s> But , in the past 10 days , he has taken a series of body blows to his pride and his reputation that could adversely affect his ability to govern this tumultuous city should he become New York 's first black mayor . </s>
<s> Ordinarily , a clever opponent would find a way to capitalize on the other side 's misfortunes . </s>
<s> But Mr. Giuliani , a celebrated prosecutor , has had difficulty switching from his crime-busting , finger-pointing mode to a political stance that suggests he might know something about running this big , troubled city . </s>
<s> And now , at the crucial moment , he 's running out of money . </s>
<s> This is the nation 's biggest city and , traditionally , its mayor is the nation 's best-known urban politician . </s>
<s> Democrats hoped that Mr. Dinkins could become a highly visible national leader . </s>
<s> Republicans figured that in Mr. Giuliani , the nation 's best-known prosecutor , they had a chance for a huge upset in the heart of Democratic territory and that they would pick up a new political star . </s>
<s> But it has n't worked out that way . </s>
<s> `` Dinkins is a decent but sloppy guy , '' says David Garth , veteran campaign consultant here who has always worked for Mayor Edward Koch , defeated by Mr. Dinkins in the Sept. 12 Democratic primary . </s>
<s> `` The alternative -- Giuliani -- is ghastly . '' </s>
<s> `` I guess we 'll reluctantly go ahead and do it , vote for Dinkins , '' says Richard Wade , a politically active professor who supported Richard Ravitch , an also-ran in the Democratic primary . </s>
<s> `` There 's nothing on the other side . '' </s>
<s> `` We 're picking up steam , '' insists Roger Ailes , Mr. Giuliani 's media consultant , whose last big campaign helped put George Bush in the White House . </s>
<s> He adds : `` It just has n't gotten down to the engine room yet . '' </s>
<s> But the steam may never reach the engine room . </s>
<s> For , just as Mr. Giuliani latches on to an issue that has Mr. Dinkins reeling , his campaign desperately needs cash to keep Mr. Ailes 's commercials on the air beyond Wednesday or Thursday . </s>
<s> To help out this week , the White House is dispatching chief of staff John Sununu and three Cabinet members -- HUD 's Jack Kemp , Transportation 's Samuel Skinner and Treasury 's Nicholas Brady , according to Peter Powers , the Giuliani campaign manager . </s>
<s> For Republicans who began this campaign with such high hopes , all of this is deeply frustrating . </s>
<s> Historically , New York is almost always in trouble . </s>
<s> But the trouble it faces now under Democratic rule seems bigger and more daunting than anything it has faced in the past . </s>
<s> This year , the city faces a budget deficit that could become even bigger next year . </s>
<s> And hardly surprising , many residents trying to cope with the city 's other problems are constantly on edge , one ethnic group scrapping with another . </s>
<s> `` People were n't so happy in the 1930s , '' says Thomas Lessner , another local professor and the biographer of the legendary Fiorello LaGuardia , the city 's fusion mayor who built a coalition Mr. Giuliani hopes to emulate . </s>
<s> `` But , at least , back then they did n't generally direct their anger at each other . '' </s>
<s> The 62-year-old Mr. Dinkins , an ex-Marine , has served as the city clerk and as Manhattan borough president , a job with limited executive responsibilities </s>
<s> -LRB- `` I defy you to come up with one major accomplishment of David Dinkins , '' says Mr. Giuliani . -RRB- </s>
<s> He defeated the contentious Mr. Koch in the Democratic primary partly because he seemed to offer hope he could heal the city 's racial and ethnic wounds . </s>
<s> His general-election campaign is almost Reagan-like , all muted pictures and comforting words . </s>
<s> His theme is unity , decency , humanity , bringing New York together again . </s>
<s> Both candidates are negotiating about holding debates , but Mr. Dinkins is widely seen as the major obstacle for scheduling them . </s>
<s> The 45-year-old Mr. Giuliani has run a negative campaign to pick up votes leaning to Mr. Dinkins . </s>
<s> `` He 's got to get Dinkins 's negatives up , '' says Lee Miringoff , director of the Marist College Institute of Public Opinion . </s>
<s> `` But our polls show voters do n't like the attack stuff . </s>
<s> Why , even 20 % of the Republican vote is going to Dinkins . '' </s>
<s> `` It 's assault-weapons politics , '' says John Siegal , Mr. Dinkins 's issues director , insisting there is a strong racist undertone to the Giuliani effort . </s>
<s> For the Giuliani forces , it 's a conundrum . </s>
<s> On the one hand , Mr. Giuliani wants to cut into Mr. Dinkins 's credibility . </s>
<s> On the other , he seeks to convince voters he 's the new Fiorello LaGuardia -- affable , good-natured and ready to lead New York out of the mess it 's in . </s>
<s> It has n't helped that he 's waffled on abortion and gay rights , sought the support of both the Liberal and Conservative parties -LRB- he won the Liberal endorsement -RRB- and that he turned to comedian Jackie Mason for help with Jewish voters . </s>
<s> Mr. Mason left the campaign after telling reporters Mr. Dinkins is `` a fancy'shvartzer ' with a moustache . '' </s>
<s> Shvartzer is a derogatory Yiddish word for a black person . </s>
<s> Mr. Dinkins concedes nothing in his ability to stumble and bumble . </s>
<s> He can match Jackie Mason with his own Robert `` Sonny '' Carson , an angry street organizer who was convicted of kidnapping in 1974 . </s>
<s> The Dinkins campaign paid Mr. Carson close to $ 10,000 to get out the vote on primary-election day . </s>
<s> Paper work on how it was spent is incomplete . </s>
<s> Mr. Carson has been charged with being anti-Semitic . </s>
<s> Asked about that the other day , he replied , `` Anti-Semitic ? </s>
<s> I 'm anti-white . '' </s>
<s> More troubling for Mr. Dinkins is his record in personal accounting . </s>
<s> It began in 1973 , when he was being considered for deputy mayor , and a routine check unearthed the extraordinary fact that he had n't paid his income tax for the previous four years . </s>
<s> `` I was always going to do it tomorrow , '' he explained at the time . </s>
<s> And now he 's busily trying to explain an arrangement in which he sold stock in Inner City Broadcasting Co. , headed by his old friend and patron , Percy Sutton , to his son , David Dinkins Jr. , for $ 58,000 . </s>
<s> He had valued the shares at more than $ 1 million two years earlier . </s>
<s> He says he sold the stock to avoid conflict-of-interest problems in his role as a voting member of the city 's Board of Estimate . </s>
<s> He says his son has n't paid for the shares . </s>
<s> `` It looks like serious tax evasion , '' says Mr. Ailes , the Giuliani media consultant . </s>
<s> `` It follows the same pattern as his tax returns . </s>
<s> He waits to talk about it until after he gets caught . '' </s>
<s> `` He simply has n't explained why something worth a million dollars ended up worth $ 58,000 two years later , '' says Mr. Powers , the Giuliani campaign manager . </s>
<s> `` It 's ludicrous for him to suggest it 's the difference between the'breakup ' value of the shares and their market value . '' </s>
<s> So far though , no one -- not even former U.S. attorney Giuliani -- has been able to pinpoint just what law Mr. Dinkins has broken or just what tax he has evaded . </s>
<s> `` The crime goes to character , '' says Ron Maiorana , a consultant to the Giuliani campaign . </s>
<s> `` It 's serious stuff . </s>
<s> He evades and ducks . </s>
<s> He 's had a history of deception and this is the latest chapter . '' </s>
<s> `` It makes people think , maybe this guy is n't so squeaky clean after all , '' says Mr. Garth , Mayor Koch 's media consultant . </s>
<s> `` The result may turn out to be a lot closer than people think . </s>
