<s> How interestingly clever of Robert Goldberg to use the form of pretend advocacy journalism to explain his perception of `` Days of Rage '' in his television critique -LRB- Leisure & Arts , Sept 11 -RRB- . </s>
<s> He chastises Jo Franklin-Trout for her inept presentation of advocacy journalism , judging her project as `` intellectually slipshod . '' </s>
<s> Was not the title very clear ? </s>
<s> One example he gives : `` She did n't ask '' -LRB- why the Palestinian children are soldiers throwing stones -RRB- . </s>
<s> Really now , did she have to ask ? </s>
<s> Were not the pictures and happenings , which have been continuing news headlines , answers enough ? </s>
<s> Mr. Goldberg contends that even as `` propaganda '' the film fails because it presents only one view . </s>
<s> Of course the Palestinians complain about their treatment ; of course the Israelis feel put upon . </s>
<s> But his complaint that `` Days of Rage '' does n't contain balanced comments from Israelis about how badly the Palestinians are behaving is irrelevant . </s>
<s> It 's like doing a documentary on apartheid and insisting that equal time be given to how terrific white South Africans are . </s>
<s> This film did emphasize how long the Israeli\/Palestinian stalemate has existed by tracing the conflict to the days of World War I when the British tried to guarantee both a Jewish state and a Palestinian state without specifying how it was to be done . </s>
<s> Well , `` Days of Rage '' airing with before-and-after packaging , and after repeated delays , was a beginning . </s>
<s> Every issue is multisided . </s>
<s> This film attempts to show a side rarely seen in our media . </s>
<s> Now we must endure a rash of critics who apparently wish to know details of one side only . </s>
<s> Salaam . </s>
