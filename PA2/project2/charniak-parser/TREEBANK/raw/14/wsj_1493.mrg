<s> Troubled Saatchi & Saatchi Co. has attracted offers for some of its advertising units , with potential suitors including Interpublic Group , but has rejected them , people familiar with the company said . </s>
<s> Industry executives said Interpublic approached Saatchi in August about buying its Campbell-Mithun-Esty unit , but was turned down by Chairman Maurice Saatchi . </s>
<s> More recently , Interpublic inquired about one of Saatchi 's smaller communications companies -- identified as the Rowland public relations firm by several industry executives -- but again was rebuffed , they said . </s>
<s> Interpublic 's chairman and chief executive officer , Philip Geier Jr. , made the pitches in visits to Mr. Saatchi in London , the executives said . </s>
<s> A Saatchi spokesman declined to comment about Interpublic . </s>
<s> But the spokesman confirmed that Saatchi has received several inquiries from companies interested in acquiring its Campbell-Mithun and Rowland units . </s>
<s> He added , `` We have no intention of selling either business . '' </s>
<s> Interpublic declined comment . </s>
<s> The offers come as Saatchi is struggling through the most troubled period in its 19-year history . </s>
<s> Takeover speculation has been rife , its consulting business is on the block , and its largest shareholder , Southeastern Asset Management , has said it 's been approached by third parties regarding a possible restructuring . </s>
<s> Analysts have continually lowered their earnings estimates for the company , and their outlook , at least for the short term , is bleak . </s>
<s> In the midst of the current turmoil , Saatchi is attempting to shore up its ad businesses . </s>
<s> It named a new chief executive officer , former IMS International head Robert Louis-Dreyfus . </s>
<s> It rebuffed an offer by Carl Spielvogel , head of Saatchi 's Backer Spielvogel Bates unit , to lead a management buy-out of all or part of Saatchi . </s>
<s> And last week , people close to Saatchi said Maurice Saatchi and his brother , Charles , would lead a buy-out if a hostile bid emerged . </s>
<s> But Saatchi 's troubles have only whipped up interest among outsiders interested in picking off pieces of its ad businesses . </s>
<s> While Saatchi 's major agency networks -- Backer Spielvogel and Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising -- would be difficult for any ad firm to buy because of potential client conflicts , its smaller businesses are quite attractive . </s>
<s> Campbell-Mithun-Esty , for example , has had big problems at its New York office , but offers strong offices in other areas of the country , including Minneapolis and Chicago . </s>
<s> That would would make it appealing to a network such as Interpublic that already has a healthy New York presence . </s>
<s> -LRB- While there would be some client conflicts , they would n't be nearly as onerous as with Saatchi 's other agencies . -RRB- </s>
<s> Campbell-Mithun also would be a sizable addition to an agency network : It has billings of about $ 850 million and blue-chip clients including General Mills , Jeep\/Eagle and Dow Brands . </s>
<s> Rowland , meanwhile , has expanded aggressively , and now ranks as the fifth-largest U.S. public relations firm , according to O'Dwyer's Directory of Public Relations Firms . </s>
<s> It would be attractive to an agency such as Interpublic , one of the few big agency groups without an affiliated public relations firm of its own . </s>
<s> Other Saatchi units include ad agency McCaffrey & McCall , which has the Mercedes account and which has been attempting to buy itself back ; and Howard Marlboro , a sports and event marketing firm . </s>
<s> Despite Saatchi 's firm stand against selling its ad units , U.S. analysts believe the company may ultimately sell some of the smaller units . </s>
<s> Mr. Louis-Dreyfus , in a recent interview , said he might sell `` a marginal agency or office . '' </s>
<s> Analysts believe he may ultimately dispose of some of the non-advertising businesses . </s>
<s> Prudential 's Final Four </s>
<s> Prudential Insurance Co. of America said it selected four agencies to pitch its $ 60 million to $ 70 million account . </s>
<s> In addition to Backer Spielvogel Bates , a Saatchi unit that has handled the account since 1970 , the other agencies include Lowe Marschalk , a unit of the Lowe Group ; Grey Advertising ; and WPP Group 's Scali , McCabe , Sloves agency . </s>
<s> All agencies are New York-based . </s>
<s> A spokesman for the insurance and financial services firm , based in Newark , N.J. , said it hopes to make a decision within three to four months . </s>
<s> Jamaica Fires Back </s>
<s> The Jamaica Tourist Board , in the wake of Young & Rubicam 's indictment on charges that it bribed Jamaican officials to win the account in 1981 , released a scathing memo blaming the agency for the embarrassing incident . </s>
<s> The memo attempts to remove the tourist board as far as possible from the agency , which pleaded innocent to the charges . </s>
<s> Among other things , the memo contends that Young & Rubicam gave false assurances that the investigation would n't uncover any information that would `` embarrass the government of Jamaica or the Jamaica Tourist Board . '' </s>
<s> It also contends that Young & Rubicam never told the tourist board about its relationship with Ad Ventures , a Jamaican firm hired by the agency . </s>
<s> The U.S. indictment charges Ad Ventures was a front used to funnel kickbacks to the then-minister of tourism . </s>
<s> The memo also chastises the agency for the timing of its announcement Thursday that it would no longer handle the $ 5 million to $ 6 million account . </s>
<s> The agency declined comment , but said it will continue work until a new agency is chosen . </s>
<s> Ad Notes ... . </s>
<s> NEW ACCOUNT </s>
<s> : American Suzuki Motor Corp. , Brea , Calif. , awarded its estimated $ 10 million to $ 30 million account to Asher\/Gould , Los Angeles . </s>
<s> Also participating in the finals was Los Angeles agency Hakuhodo Advertising America . </s>
<s> American Suzuki 's previous agency , Keye\/Donna\/Pearlstein , did n't participate . </s>
<s> AYER TALKS : </s>
<s> N W Ayer 's president and chief executive officer , Jerry J. Siano , said the agency is holding `` conversations '' about acquiring Zwiren Collins Karo & Trusk , a midsized Chicago agency , but a deal is n't yet close to being completed . </s>
<s> WHO 'S NEWS : </s>
<s> John Wells , 47 , former president and chief executive of N W Ayer 's Chicago office , was named management director and director of account services at WPP Group 's J. Walter Thompson agency in Chicago ... . </s>
