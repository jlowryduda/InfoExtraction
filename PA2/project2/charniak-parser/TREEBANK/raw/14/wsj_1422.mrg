<s> France 's national tobacco company , known for making brown-tobacco cigarettes such as Gauloises and Gitanes , is branching out . </s>
<s> Concerned by dipping demand for its traditional products , it is moving not only into blonde cigarettes , but also into electronic car-parking payment cards to be sold in neighborhood tobacco stores . </s>
<s> Brown tobacco in France is a more pungent , stronger grade than the lighter grade , or blonde tobacco , used in so-called American-style cigarettes . </s>
<s> `` We are n't Philip Morris Cos. , '' says Bertrand de Galle , chairman of government-owned Societe Nationale d'Exploitation Industrielle des Tabacs & Allumettes S.A. , known as Seita . </s>
<s> He says that because Seita 's profits are limited by government-controlled cigarette prices , he does n't have the cash to diversify as heavily into food and drink as the U.S. concern has done . </s>
<s> -LRB- Last year , for example , Seita 's net profit soared 150 % to 461.6 million French francs -LRB- $ 73.5 million -RRB- on sales of FFr 27.68 billion - a 1.7 % profit margin . -RRB- </s>
<s> Instead , he said in an interview , he is looking for ways to exploit France 's network of 39,000 tobacco agents , most of them cafes . </s>
<s> While Seita does n't own the French tabacs , its close alliance with them offers distribution possibilities . </s>
<s> One proposal is to introduce a new payment system for parking in Paris . </s>
<s> Instead of paying for parking by putting money in the existing machines , which deliver little paper receipts , drivers would be able to buy electronic cards in local tobacco shops . </s>
<s> Once activated , the card would sit in the car 's window , showing traffic wardens how much time the motorist could remain . </s>
<s> When the motorist returned to his car he could turn the card off and , if it showed time remaining , save it for later . </s>
<s> Seita is a partner in the project , which was developed by Matra SA using Japanese technology . </s>
<s> Seita and Matra currently are negotiating with city officials for the right to begin service . </s>
<s> And Seita is considering further diversification . </s>
<s> It wanted to buy RJR Nabisco Inc. 's French cracker subsidiary , Belin , in hopes of selling its products in tobacco stores , but lost the bidding to food group BSN SA . </s>
<s> It currently is considering bidding for Swedish Match Co . </s>
<s> And it retains an interest in acquiring candies and other articles that might be sold in tobacco shops . </s>
<s> It also is trying to shore up its tobacco business . </s>
<s> Brown-tobacco cigarettes such as Gauloises now make up just 40 % of the French tobacco market , half the level of about two decades ago . </s>
<s> While Seita retains a manufacturing monopoly in France , it is being hurt by rising imports and from waning cigarette demand . </s>
<s> So Seita has introduced blonde cigarettes under the Gauloises label , and intends to relaunch the unsuccessful Gitanes Blondes in new packaging , similar to the slide-packs used by brown-tobacco Gitanes . </s>
<s> The aim , says Mr. de Galle , is to win market share from imported cigarettes , and to persuade smokers who are switching to blonde cigarettes to keep buying French . </s>
