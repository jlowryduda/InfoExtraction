<s> Winnebago Industries Inc. , battered by a deepening slowdown in recreational vehicle industry sales , reported a widened fourth-quarter loss and slashed its dividend in half . </s>
<s> The Forest City , Iowa , maker of motor homes said it had a loss of $ 11.3 million , or 46 cents a share , in the quarter ended Aug. 26 . </s>
<s> A year earlier , the company had a deficit of $ 1.5 million , or six cents a share . </s>
<s> The cut in the dividend to 10 cents a share semiannually , from 20 cents , `` would indicate to me they do n't see the problems being fixed real quick , '' said Frank Rolfes , an analyst at Dain Bosworth Inc. in Minneapolis . </s>
<s> Indeed , Winnebago said it started `` several promotional programs '' to spur retail sales in the fall and winter . </s>
<s> The year was already shaping up as a difficult one for the recreational vehicle industry , which makes products such as motor homes , travel trailers , folding campers and van conversions . </s>
<s> With the exception of van conversions , the industry has seen a decline from 1988 's robust sales . </s>
<s> But the rate of the decline snowballed in August , with unit sales to dealers for the month down 10.5 % from a year earlier , according to the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association . </s>
<s> At Winnebago , sales for the quarter fell 6 % to $ 89.5 million from $ 95.4 million a year earlier . </s>
<s> The company attributed the decline to consumers ' concern over interest rates and gas prices -- two key expenses for RV buyers . </s>
<s> `` It 's a large-ticket discretionary purchase , '' said Robert Curran , who follows the industry for Merrill Lynch & Co . </s>
<s> `` So when there 's talk and concern about the economy , it 's not unreasonable for a portion of the buying public to defer purchases . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Curran expects industry RV sales for all of 1989 to fall about 5 % from 1988 , when sales of 427,300 units were the highest since 1978 . </s>
<s> And he said the weakness could continue in the first half of next year . </s>
<s> But he said the industry has `` a good decade ahead , '' particularly if aging baby boomers fulfill the industry 's dreams by buying RVs . </s>
<s> Winnebago was hit especially hard in the latest downturn because unit sales in its bread-and-butter motor home business tumbled 25 % industrywide in August , and 10.4 % in the first eight months of the year . </s>
<s> The company said it also suffered in the quarter from incentive programs , losses from discontinuing a motor home line and costs of developing a new commercial vehicle , among other things . </s>
<s> The news sent Winnebago stock falling 62.5 cents , to $ 5.25 , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading - a 52-week low . </s>
<s> The dividend cut will prove most costly for John K. Hanson , Winnebago 's founder and chairman . </s>
<s> Based on his control of about 45 % of Winnebago 's 24.7 million shares , his annual dividend income would be cut to about $ 2.2 million from $ 4.4 million . </s>
<s> For the year , Winnebago had a loss of $ 4.7 million , or 19 cents a share , following profit of $ 2.7 million , or 11 cents a share , a year earlier . </s>
<s> Sales rose 2 % to $ 437.5 million from $ 430.3 million . </s>
