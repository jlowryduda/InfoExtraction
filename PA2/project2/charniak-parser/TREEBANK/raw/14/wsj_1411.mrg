<s> The Dallas Cowboys are looking at a long-yardage situation , struggling to pull ahead of the Atlanta Falcons . </s>
<s> Up in his stadium box , their new and controversial owner , Jerral `` Jerry '' Jones , watches anxiously as the team bounds up to the scrimmage line . </s>
<s> Mr. Jones takes heart . </s>
<s> There in the center of the pack is quarterback Troy Aikman , the key to the Cowboys ' comeback strategy . </s>
<s> So key , in fact , that Mr. Jones signed him in April for $ 11.4 million over the next six years -- a record for a rookie . </s>
<s> `` He 's a genuine Wheaties-box athlete , '' gushes Mr. Jones . </s>
<s> With three minutes left on the clock , Mr. Aikman takes the snap , steps back and fires a 21-yard pass -- straight into the hands of an Atlanta defensive back . </s>
<s> The crowd groans , Mr. Jones shakes his head , the Cowboys lose the game . </s>
<s> A few days after that Sept. 17 game , Mr. Aikman broke a finger , sidelining him for weeks . </s>
<s> Ah , the glamour of professional sports . </s>
<s> For Mr. Jones , losing his quarterback temporarily was just the latest in a string of setbacks that has beset the Dallas Cowboys -- and , this year , much of the National Football League . </s>
<s> Once fat and happy , the Cowboys now are losing games , fans and money . </s>
<s> Last year , the team ended up $ 2 million in the red on $ 30 million in revenue . </s>
<s> It has some of the highest costs in the league . </s>
<s> Its attendance is off 23 % from six years ago . </s>
<s> At the very least , Mr. Jones , who cultivates the society circuit as eagerly as his bench , can take comfort in one fact : These days , he is n't alone . </s>
<s> Nearly half the owners of the 28 National Football League teams are losing money , the result of flat attendance , aging stadiums and -- more than anything -- skyrocketing salaries for star players like Mr. Aikman . </s>
<s> Last year , the top 12 players on each NFL team took home an average $ 536,000 , a figure comparable to baseball and higher than in basketball . </s>
<s> First-round draft picks have done even better : Average salaries and bonuses for them rose to $ 685,000 this year , up 44 % from 1987 . </s>
<s> `` It 's a vicious circle , '' says Art Modell , owner of the Cleveland Browns . </s>
<s> `` One team pays so much and the other pays more . </s>
<s> We just do n't have that kind of income stream . '' </s>
<s> All this is causing convulsions in professional football . </s>
<s> Owners , largely complacent in the past , are now almost desperately looking for ways to lower costs and raise revenue -- embracing some revolutionary ideas in the process . </s>
<s> Though not intentionally , the Cowboys ' Mr. Jones has come to represent this new breed of owner . </s>
<s> Shortly after buying 66 % of the team from H.R. `` Bum '' Bright for $ 145 million , and mindful of the Cowboys ' ragged bottom line , the 47-year-old Mr. Jones set about his own round of team cuts . </s>
<s> First , he unceremoniously sacked Tom Landry , the legendary coach who took the Cowboys to five Super Bowls and 20 consecutive winning seasons . </s>
<s> In Dallas , Mr. Landry has a standing just shy of sainthood . </s>
<s> Anti-Jones sentiment flooded the local press : `` A crude obnoxious hick , '' said one writer ; `` a real oink , '' said another ; `` Who in the hell does he think he is ? '' wrote a third . </s>
<s> For Mr. Jones , it was just the beginning . </s>
<s> He quickly cut the team 's bloated administrative staff by half , shut down a Cowboys-owned dance academy and , in July , announced plans to sell Valley Ranch , the team 's 30-acre practice camp and the most lavish training facility in the NFL . </s>
<s> Mr. Jones calls the ranch `` the Pentagon of Sportdom . '' </s>
<s> It is a maze of halls that connects film rooms , elaborate spas and weight-training centers that testify to a richer , more free-spending era . </s>
<s> He likes to tell the yarn of how he got lost on the expansive ranch during an early visit , took refuge in an office and called the front desk for help . </s>
<s> `` I said , ` Somebody come get me . </s>
<s> I 'm at extension 29 . ' '' </s>
<s> With a new day dawning on the sport , Mr. Jones does n't see a place for this sort of luxury . </s>
<s> `` It 's just not cost efficient , '' he says . </s>
<s> The place costs nearly $ 2 million a year to maintain . </s>
<s> When he sells it , he says , the Cowboys will move to a more practical -- read affordable -- grass practice field near Texas Stadium . </s>
<s> And as for Tom Landry , well , in Mr. Jones 's mind , he had played out his winning years . </s>
<s> After posting losing seasons in each of the last three years , the Cowboys needed a change , he says . </s>
<s> Football has long been Mr. Jones 's passion , both on and off the field . </s>
<s> An Arkansas native , he started at guard on the undefeated 1964 University of Arkansas team that won a national championship . </s>
<s> After college , he worked at his father 's insurance company in Little Rock , and in 1966 led an aborted attempt to buy the San Diego Chargers . </s>
<s> Years later , with cash from the sale of the insurance company , he founded Arkoma Production Corp. , an oil and gas exploration company based in Little Rock . </s>
<s> So it was n't surprising that Mr. Jones returned to his Arkansas roots when he went looking for a replacement for Mr. Landry . </s>
<s> He tapped Jimmy Johnson , a teammate on the 1964 University of Arkansas squad and the head coach at the University of Miami , where he led the Hurricanes to five winning seasons and a national championship in 1987 . </s>
<s> Whatever Mr. Johnson 's talents , in the hearts and minds of many Dallas fans , he is no Tom Landry . </s>
<s> Seven games -LRB- and , after a loss to the Kansas City Chiefs yesterday , seven losses -RRB- into the season , the `` new '' Cowboys are n't doing any better than the old . </s>
<s> In fact , the last time they played this badly was in 1960 , their opening season . </s>
<s> Average attendance at their games , about 49,000 last year , continues flat . </s>
<s> Mr. Jones is attacking the problem on several fronts . </s>
<s> He continues to reshuffle the team , trading famed running back Herschel Walker to the Minnesota Vikings this month for a slew of players and future draft picks . </s>
<s> To try to draw more fans , he has dropped end-zone ticket prices from $ 25 to $ 19 . </s>
<s> But the general trend , given rising costs in the league , has been to raise prices , and Mr. Jones is expected to eventually follow suit . </s>
<s> `` It 's simple , '' says Lamar Hunt , who owns the Kansas City Chiefs and last year raised ticket prices by $ 2.40 to an average $ 17 . </s>
<s> `` If we did n't increase prices , we 'd be in the red . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Jones has also beefed up his marketing staff to sell the 118 luxury suites topping Texas Stadium -LRB- his deal with Bum Bright included operating rights for the stadium -RRB- . </s>
<s> The suites are air-conditioned , have wet bars and plush seating , and offer a clear view of the field -- all for a sale price of $ 475,000 to $ 1 million , depending on their size and location . </s>
<s> Mr. Jones has been taking prospective suite owners onto the field during practice to let them rub elbows with players , and promises those who actually buy one of the rooms an insider 's look at the team 's strategy before game time . </s>
<s> The sales job seems to be paying off : When he bought the team , only six of the suites had been sold . </s>
<s> Today , 30 have . </s>
<s> Gate receipts are only the Cowboys ' second largest source of cash . </s>
<s> The biggest is the NFL 's contract with national television for broadcast of the league 's games . </s>
<s> Last year , the Cowboys ' share of that pie came to $ 17.6 million . </s>
<s> The team additionally earns between $ 2 million and $ 4 million for local radio and television broadcast rights . </s>
<s> Mr. Jones is currently trying to jack up the price for those local rights . </s>
<s> He is also trying to get more stations in Mexico , where the Cowboys have a following , to pick up the games . </s>
<s> Mr. Jones , whose twangy voice and folksy ways belie an intense businessman who works 16-hour days , is resigned to the hefty salaries he pays his players these days . </s>
<s> He calls the contracts `` critical to winning in the NFL '' and has played his part in the bidding wars . </s>
<s> Besides signing Mr. Aikman to a sizable contract , Mr. Jones has agreed to pay rookie quarterback Steve Walsh $ 4.1 million over the next four years . </s>
<s> This wage inflation is bleeding the NFL dry , the owners contend . </s>
<s> Soon , only large corporations will be able to afford to buy and run football teams , predicts John J. Veatch Jr. , an investment banker with Salomon Brothers who handled the Cowboys sale . </s>
<s> To tackle the problem , NFL owners have proposed setting a rookie wage scale to try to rein in salaries . </s>
<s> Details of the plan , which would go into effect in 1993 , are sketchy , but each player would apparently be paid a base salary keyed to his position and ability . </s>
<s> Bonuses would be paid based on playing time and performance . </s>
<s> The NFL Players Association , meanwhile , contends that athletes are paid a wage commensurate with their ability to draw fans , and that some owners are in financial trouble because of poor business management , not players ' salaries . </s>
<s> The owners are trying to boost profit in other ways , too . </s>
<s> Many have launched promotions to attract new fans and are renegotiating dated stadium contracts . </s>
<s> Most of the owners must pay up to 10 % of gross ticket sales for leases on stadiums they say are either too small or too old . </s>
<s> In Chicago , for example , size is the issue . </s>
<s> `` We have the worst lease in the NFL , '' contends Michael B. McCaskey , the president of the Chicago Bears and a grandson of George Halas , who founded the NFL 's predecessor organization . </s>
<s> `` We 're in a metro area with millions of Bear fans , and only a small number can be accommodated . '' </s>
<s> When the lease expires in 1999 , he says , `` It 's got to be changed . '' </s>
<s> This year , the NFL also imposed an 80-player limit on teams going into training camp , down from 120 , in a move meant to trim payroll costs . </s>
<s> And the league is trying to get more for its three-year national network contract , which expires after this season . </s>
<s> The current contract pays the NFL $ 1.4 billion . </s>
<s> Owners say they expect the league to demand a 50 % increase , despite the fact that televised football games have had lackluster ratings . </s>
<s> An NFL spokesman also says the league will probably expand its offerings to cable TV companies like ESPN . </s>
<s> The changes have n't come easy . </s>
<s> Like the game of professional football , the NFL organization itself is in turmoil . </s>
<s> The new breed of team owner , Mr. Jones included , has been fighting the NFL bureaucracy for a greater say in league affairs , and the battle has produced a form of organizational gridlock . </s>
<s> In July , 11 NFL owners , almost all of them new , blocked an effort to install Jim Finks as a replacement for retiring league commissioner Pete Rozelle . </s>
<s> Mr. Finks is perceived by some owners as a standard-bearer for the Old Guard . </s>
<s> Earlier this month , another effort to choose a commissioner failed . </s>
<s> The owners meet again tomorrow . </s>
<s> For his part , Jerry Jones says he 's in the business for the long haul , and his work style seems to support that . </s>
<s> He puts in busy six-day weeks -LRB- excluding game days -RRB- , and on one recent afternoon fielded questions , in the course of an hour , from a TV producer , his luxury-suite marketing manager , a disgruntled customer and a roomful of Arkansas reporters . </s>
<s> To keep his schedule on track , he flies two personal secretaries in from Little Rock to augment his staff in Dallas . </s>
<s> `` When I made this investment , I made it on a lifetime basis , '' he explains . </s>
<s> `` I 'm not here to make money by reselling the team later on . </s>
<s> While the Cowboys may not be the best investment now , I do n't accept they ca n't be in the future . '' </s>
<s> Besides , to a large extent , Mr. Jones may already be getting what he wants out of the team , even though it keeps losing . </s>
<s> Owning the Cowboys has bought him entree to a glitzy life that drilling for oil in Arkansas just did n't provide . </s>
<s> There is the new private jet , the platoon of assistants , invitations to the best parties , and television appearances on shows such as `` Prime Time Live . '' </s>
<s> A few weeks ago , Mr. Jones even entertained Elizabeth Taylor in his private suite at Texas Stadium . </s>
<s> `` You 're in the catbird seat every day in this job , '' he says . </s>
