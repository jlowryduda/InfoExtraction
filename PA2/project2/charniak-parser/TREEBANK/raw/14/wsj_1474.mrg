<s> High-definition television promises to be the TV of tomorrow , so it is a natural multibillion-dollar market . </s>
<s> Although major U.S. manufacturers have all but ceded the main segment of that future business to Japan , not everyone here is ready to give up . </s>
<s> A handful of small U.S. companies are struggling to develop the technology to build the screens for the thin , high-quality televisions that are expected to hang on living room walls by the end of the 1990s . </s>
<s> With only small help from the government , these start-up concerns are trying to compete with the Goliaths of the Japanese consumer electronics industry , which enjoy considerable backing from the Japanese government . </s>
<s> Photonics Technology Inc. of Northwood , Ohio , aims to use a new form of plasma technology to put movie-quality images on a TV display that is 40 inches in diameter but only a few inches thick . </s>
<s> Planar Systems Inc. of Beaverton , Ore. , the largest of these firms , with $ 20 million in annual revenue , has similar plans . </s>
<s> It already has had success in electroluminescence , another promising technology adaptable for high-definition television . </s>
<s> Two other firms , Ovonic Imaging Systems Inc. of Troy , Mich. , and Magnascreen Corp. of Pittsburgh are developing a variation of the flat-panel screens called active-matrix liquid crystal displays . </s>
<s> The new technologies are intended to retire the cathode-ray tube , which accounts for most of the bulk of the conventional TV set . </s>
<s> Replacing the cathode-ray tube with a large , thin screen is the key to the creation of a high-definition television , or HDTV , which is expected to become a $ 30 billion business world-wide within a decade . </s>
<s> Large U.S. companies are interested in other segments of the HDTV business , such as signal-processing and broadcast equipment . </s>
<s> But except for Zenith Electronics Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. , which is collaborating with Toshiba on computer displays , they are poorly positioned to exploit advances in large panels . </s>
<s> General Electric Co. recently sold off its interests in liquid-crystal displays to Thompson-CSF of France . </s>
<s> `` We found the market not developing as we thought it would , '' a GE spokesman says . </s>
<s> The small U.S. firms are persisting because of their strong positions in patents , and because the prize is still there to be seized . </s>
<s> `` No one yet has shown the ability to manufacture these panels '' at commercial costs , says Zvi Yaniv , the president of Ovonic Imaging . </s>
<s> He says he thinks his company is just a few years from doing that . </s>
<s> The Bush administration , hearing conflicting advice about what its role in HDTV should be , is n't doing much for now . </s>
<s> The only material support it is extending to the struggling U.S. industry is $ 30 million in awards from the Pentagon 's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency . </s>
<s> The DARPA funds are a pittance compared with what Japan and other prospective competitors are spending . </s>
<s> The Commerce Department estimates that Japanese government and industry spending on HDTV research is already over $ 1 billion . </s>
<s> `` Unless it gets more help , the U.S. industry wo n't have a chance , '' says Peter Friedman , Photonics 's executive vice president . </s>
<s> Thus far , almost all of the basic technology relating to high-definition television has come from U.S. laboratories . </s>
<s> But Peter Brody , Magnascreen 's president , says Japanese companies are poised to snatch the technology and put it to commercial use , just as they did with earlier U.S. innovations in color television and video recording . </s>
<s> In the 1970s , Mr. Brody helped develop the first display panels based on active-matrix liquid crystals at Westinghouse Electric Corp. 's research labs in Pittsburgh . </s>
<s> The panels are like oversized semiconductors surfaced with a million or more picture elements , each contributing to the color and tone of a TV image . </s>
<s> In 1979 , however , Westinghouse abandoned the project along with its stake in advanced television . </s>
<s> Mr. Brody left the company to find other backers . </s>
<s> He has a claim to the right to commercialize the Westinghouse patents , but he contends that those patents are being infringed by a number of Japanese producers . </s>
<s> `` Most American investors have just given up , '' Mr. Brody says . </s>
<s> `` They are n't prepared to compete in an area where the Japanese want to enter . '' </s>
<s> Many critics question the industry 's need for federal support ; the Pentagon justifies its help on national-security grounds . </s>
<s> `` We do n't see a domestic source for some of our -LCB- HDTV -RCB- requirements , and that 's a source of concern , '' says Michael Kelly , director of DARPA 's defense manufacturing office . </s>
<s> So DARPA is trying to keep the industry interested in developing large display panels by doling out research funds . </s>
<s> HDTV already has some military applications , such as creating realistic flight simulations and transmitting information to combat commanders . </s>
<s> The Navy is ordering displays for its Aegis cruisers and the Army wants smaller versions for its Abrams battle tanks . </s>
<s> The Commerce Department also is trying to encourage HDTV because of the benefits that could spin off to the semiconductor and computer industries . </s>
<s> `` It is n't just yuppie television , '' argues Jack Clifford , director of the department 's office of microelectronics and instrumentation . </s>
<s> `` The industry will create industrial products such as displays for work stations and medical diagnostic equipment before it acquires a mass consumer market . '' </s>
<s> Although some HDTV advocates are calling for other forms of aid , such as antitrust relief for research consortia , the small firms simply would prefer more DARPA funds . </s>
<s> Each claims to possess the right technology and wants just a bit more money to make it commercial . </s>
<s> They also want U.S. trade policy to reflect the Pentagon and Commerce department 's concern over their future . </s>
<s> They all are strongly opposed to a petition from several Japanese TV manufacturers , including Matsushita , Hitachi , and Toshiba , to exempt portable color TVs with liquid-crystal displays from anti-dumping duties that the U.S. imposes on the larger Japanese color TVs . </s>
<s> And they want the U.S. to help them sell overseas . </s>
<s> Planar President James Hurd says he has to pay tariffs as high as 15 % to sell his display panels in Japan and South Korea , while panels from those countries enter the U.S. duty-free . </s>
<s> `` This is n't a technology issue , but an attitude issue , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` We just have n't learned what it takes to compete . </s>
