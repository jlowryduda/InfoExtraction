<s> In terms of sheer brutality , the Somali regime of Siad Barre may rank as No. 1 in the world . </s>
<s> The only reason that Somalia remains in obscurity is numbers : a sparsely populated wasteland of 8.5 million people spread out over an expanse nearly the size of Texas . </s>
<s> The Barre dictatorship simply is limited in the amount of people it can torture and kill . </s>
<s> Beheading small children , stabbing elderly people to death , raping and shooting women , and burying people alive are just a few of the grisly activities that the Somali armed forces have been engaged in over the past two years . </s>
<s> Up to 500,000 Somalis have escaped to the relative safety of Marxist Ethiopia because of the behavior of President Barre 's troops . </s>
<s> In the port of Berbera , for example , hundreds of men of the rival Issak clan were rounded up in May 1988 , imprisoned , and then taken out at night in groups of five to 50 men to be executed without any judicial process whatsoever . </s>
<s> Guns were never used : Each man was stabbed to death with a large knife . </s>
<s> The horrific details are only now emerging from a painstakingly documented report , based on hundreds of interviews with randomly selected refugees . </s>
<s> The study was done by Robert Gersony , a consultant to the U.S. State Department who has years of experience in investigating human-rights abuses on both sides of the left-right ideological divide . </s>
<s> What gives these events particular significance , however , is the fact that they are part of a wider drama affecting the strategic positions of both the U.S. and the Soviet Union on the horn of Africa . </s>
<s> Not since the late 1970s has the horn been so up for grabs as it has suddenly become in just the past few weeks . </s>
<s> Mr. Barre 's rule is crumbling fast . </s>
<s> Mutinies wrack his armed forces -LRB- really just an armed gang -RRB- , which control less than half the country . </s>
<s> Inflation is at record levels . </s>
<s> Desperate , he has called in the Libyans to help fight the rebels of the Somali National Movement in the north , which is only one of several groups picking away at the regime in the capital of Mogadishu . </s>
<s> Seventy years old and a self-declared `` scientific socialist , '' President Barre has a power base , composed only of his minority Mareham clan , that according to observers is `` narrowing . '' </s>
<s> The U.S. 's interest in Somalia consists of a single runway at the port of Berbera , which U.S. military aircraft have the right to use for surveillance of the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean . </s>
<s> That strip of concrete is backed up by a few one-story , air-conditioned shacks where a handful of American nationals -- buttressed by imported food , cold soft drinks and back issues of Sports Illustrated -- maintain radio contact with the outside world . </s>
<s> In the past two years , the desert behind them has become a land of mass executions and utter anarchy , where , due to Mr. Barre 's brutality and ineptitude , nobody is any longer in control . </s>
<s> As long as the rival Soviet-backed regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam held a total gridlock over neighboring Ethiopia , the U.S. was forced to accept that lonely Berbera runway as a distant No. 2 to the Soviets ' array of airfields next door . </s>
<s> But due to dramatic events on the battlefield over the past few days and weeks , those Soviet bases may soon be as endangered and as lonely as the American runway . </s>
<s> On Sept. 7 , I wrote on these pages about the killing and capturing of 10,000 Ethiopian soldiers by Eritrean and Tigrean guerrillas . </s>
<s> Recently , in Wollo province in the center of Ethiopia , Tigrean forces have killed , wounded and captured an additional 20,000 government troops . </s>
<s> -LRB- Think what these numbers mean -- considering the headline space devoted to hundreds of deaths in Lebanon , a small country of little strategic importance ! -RRB- </s>
<s> Tigrean armies are now 200 miles north of Addis Ababa , threatening the town of Dese , which would cut off Mr. Mengistu 's capital from the port of Assab , through which all fuel and other supplies reach Addis Ababa . </s>
<s> As a result , Mr. Mengistu has been forced to transfer thousands of troops from Eritrea just to hold the town , thereby risking the loss of even more territory in Eritrea only to keep the Tigreans at bay . </s>
<s> Mr. Mengistu is in an increasingly weak position : Half his army is tied down defending the northern city of Asmara from the Eritreans . </s>
<s> The weaker he gets , the more he turns toward the U.S. for help . </s>
<s> While the Tigreans are communists , like the Eritreans they are among the most anti-Soviet guerrillas in the world , having suffered more than a decade of aerial bombardment by the Soviet-supplied Mengistu air force . </s>
<s> What this all means in shorthand is that Soviet dominance in Ethiopia is collapsing as fast as President Barre 's regime in Somalia is . </s>
<s> The U.S. , therefore , has a historic opportunity both to strike a blow for human rights in Somalia and to undo the superpower flip-flop of the late 1970s on the Horn of Africa . </s>
<s> Back to Somalia : </s>
<s> The State Department , to its credit , has already begun distancing itself from Mr. Barre , evinced by its decision to publish the Gersony report -LRB- which the press has ignored -RRB- . </s>
<s> What 's more , the U.S. has suspended $ 2.5 million in military aid and $ 1 million in economic aid . </s>
<s> But this is not enough . </s>
<s> Because the U.S. is still perceived to be tied to Mr. Barre , when he goes the runway could go too . </s>
<s> Considering how tenuous the security of that runway is anyway , the better option -- both morally and strategically -- would be for the Bush administration to blast the regime publicly , in terms clear enough for all influential Somalis to understand . </s>
<s> It is a certainty that Mr. Barre 's days are numbered . </s>
<s> The U.S. should take care , however , that its own position in the country does not go down with him . </s>
<s> Nobody is sure what will come next in Somalia or whom the successor might be . </s>
<s> But as one expert tells me : `` Whoever it is will have to work pretty damn hard to be worse than Barre . '' </s>
<s> While the State Department positions itself for the post-Barre period in Somalia , it should continue to back former President Carter 's well-intentioned role as a mediator between Mr. Mengistu and the Eritrean guerrillas in Ethiopia , while concomitantly opening up channels of communications with the Tigrean rebels through neighboring Sudan . </s>
<s> Ethiopian politics are the most sophisticated , secretive and Byzantine in all of black Africa . </s>
<s> Remember that it took Mr. Mengistu many months , in what became known as the `` creeping coup , '' to topple Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974 and 1975 . </s>
<s> There is simply no way to engineer a succession covertly , as is sometimes possible elsewhere on the continent . </s>
<s> But the U.S. has one great advantage : The Soviets are universally loathed throughout Ethiopia for what they did to the country this past decade -- famine and all . </s>
<s> It 's not just in Eastern Europe where the march of events is finally on the U.S. side , but on the horn of Africa as well . </s>
<s> The only U.S. liability in the region is what remains of the link to Mr. Barre , and that should be cut fast . </s>
<s> Mr. Kaplan , author of `` Surrender or Starve : The Wars Behind the Famine '' -LRB- Westview Press , 1988 -RRB- , lives in Lisbon . </s>
