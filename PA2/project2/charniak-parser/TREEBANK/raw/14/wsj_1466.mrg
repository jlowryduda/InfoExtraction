<s> The Better Business Bureau of San Diego and the state Attorney General 's office entered into a settlement stemming from an investigation of bureau-sponsored business directories published by an outside firm , Better Book Inc . </s>
<s> The settlement stems from charges that Better Book , now defunct , made misrepresentations in selling advertising for the directories and memberships in the bureau from 1984 to 1986 . </s>
<s> Without admitting any guilt , the bureau agreed to several conditions if it again contracts with an outside firm to publish its directories . </s>
<s> The conditions include not misrepresenting how many directories will be distributed , and agreeing to make refunds to directory advertisers if any misrepresentations are involved in the sale . </s>
<s> The Attorney General 's investigation was sparked by lawsuits and charges by angry California businesspeople that they were swindled in a bureau-sponsored directory project contracted by Better Book . </s>
<s> The uproar led to the closing of the Los Angeles Better Business Bureau in late 1987 . </s>
