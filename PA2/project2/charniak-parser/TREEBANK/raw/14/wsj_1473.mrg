<s> First , the somewhat affected idealism of the 1960s . </s>
<s> Then , the all-too-sincere opportunism of the 1970s and 1980s . </s>
<s> What now ? </s>
<s> To judge from novels that mirror the contemporary scene , we 're back in the age of anxiety . </s>
<s> Where '60s dropouts professed to scorn middle-class life and ambitious yuppies hoped to leave it far behind as they scaled the upper reaches of success , it now seems that so many people feel they 're slipping between the cracks , that middle-class life is viewed with nostalgia or outright longing . </s>
<s> Lisa Zeidner 's third novel , `` Limited Partnerships '' -LRB- North Point Press , 256 pages , $ 18.95 -RRB- is a stylish , funny and thoughtful look at the way love relationships are affected by the pressures of money , or , more specifically , the lack of it . </s>
<s> Nora Worth and Malcolm DeWitt , 33 and 39 respectively , live together in a townhouse in a transitional Philadelphia neighborhood . </s>
<s> Malcolm , a former film-maker turned architect , has just seen his first big chance at a lucrative commission turn to dust with the arrest of his shady , obnoxious client , a fly-by-night real estate developer . </s>
<s> Nora , who still has artistic aspirations , knows she is lucky to be working as a food stylist , prepping pies , burgers , frosty cold drinks and other comestibles to look as appetizing as possible in front of the camera . </s>
<s> After all , she reasons , `` there were housewives with Nikons and degrees from cooking schools in France who would kill for her job . '' </s>
<s> But Nora and Malcolm feel trapped . </s>
<s> They seem to be having the `` worst of both worlds : artistic work with none of art 's integrity and no control over the finished product ; self-employment without fun or profit . '' </s>
<s> It 's a downbeat , `` thirtysomething '' world , in which bright , still youngish people are engaged in a glossy version of day labor , doing free-lance , semi-professional work that brings little satisfaction or security but that they know they should be grateful to do . </s>
<s> Uncertainty dogs every aspect of their lives . </s>
<s> Malcolm faces bankruptcy and an IRS audit , but Nora finds an extra $ 30,000 in her bank account , suddenly increasing her available funds some fifteenfold . </s>
<s> While she is wondering whether to live it up , and do something even more dramatic , say get married , her life is further complicated by the reappearance of an old flame , David , a film critic and actor who always seems to be just on the brink of stardom . </s>
<s> In novels of an earlier vintage , David would have represented excitement and danger ; Malcolm , placid , middle-class security . </s>
<s> The irony in this novel is that neither man represents a `` safe '' middle-class haven : Nora 's decision is between emotional excitement and emotional security , with no firm economic base anywhere . </s>
<s> The characters confront a world in which it seems increasingly difficult to find a `` middle way '' between the extremes of success and failure , wealth and poverty . </s>
<s> In making Malcolm and Nora such wonderfully representative specimens of their class and generation , Ms. Zeidner has somewhat neglected the task of making them distinctively individual characters . </s>
<s> The humor of the story owes much to the fact that no hearts -LRB- even the characters ' own -RRB- are likely to bleed for the plight of health-food eaters . </s>
<s> But readers may well feel the pangs of recognition . </s>
<s> In any case , the foundering middle classes are n't the only ones in trouble -- or whose troubles provide material for fiction . </s>
<s> `` Rascal Money '' -LRB- Contemporary Books , 412 pages , $ 17.95 -RRB- , a novel by consultant and business analyst Joseph R. Garber , tells the story of an innovative , well-run , widely respected computer manufacturing company called PegaSys as it faces a hostile takeover attempt by AIW , a much smaller corporation that is so incompetently managed as to constitute a standing joke in the business world . </s>
<s> Patrician , dynamic Scott Thatcher , founder and head of PegaSys , initially finds the takeover threat risible . </s>
<s> But , as he and his skilled team soon discover , they 're up against two factors they had n't counted on : first , a business climate in which a failing company with few assets and many debts can borrow against the assets of the successful company it hopes to acquire in order to finance the takeover ; second , that standing behind AIW is a sinister consortium of much bigger , shadier and shrewder foreign interests secretly providing the money and muscle for the deal . </s>
<s> Mr. Garber manages to invest this tale of financial wars with the colorful characters and fast-paced action of a suspense novel . </s>
<s> And like a spy or mystery story , this novel has strong elements of allegory , as the good and evil forces battle it out . </s>
<s> Mr. Garber depicts these moral qualities with the broad brush strokes of a satire that occasionally descends to the realm of cliched caricatures . </s>
<s> Standard-issue portraits of flaky Californians , snobbish homosexuals and Neanderthal union leaders undermine the force of the author 's perceptions . </s>
<s> Yet the heavy-handedness of the satire also can be effective in a book like this : If the head of AIW were not portrayed as an utterly contemptible , malicious dolt , we would not much care whether his schemes were defeated , and would not be so diverted in the process . </s>
<s> Ms. Rubin is a free-lance writer based in Los Angeles . </s>
