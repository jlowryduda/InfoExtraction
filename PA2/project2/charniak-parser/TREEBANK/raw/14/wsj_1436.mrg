<s> The neighborhood around Alexander Haagen Co. 's Vermont-Slauson Shopping Center in the Watts section of Los Angeles resembles the crime-ridden , deteriorating sections of many inner cities and certainly is n't the sort of area one would choose to visit . </s>
<s> But turn into the shopping center 's parking lot , and one could be in the safe , busy mall of a prosperous suburb . </s>
<s> Only it is safer , and busier . </s>
<s> Over the past year there have been only one burglary , three thefts of or from autos , no purse-snatchings , and one attempted robbery in the mall , which opened in late 1981 . </s>
<s> A shopping center of similar size in an affluent Los Angeles suburb would , per year , be expected to have eight burglaries , 70 thefts of or from autos , and four robberies . </s>
<s> The Watts mall has annual sales of more than $ 350 per leasable square foot ; the figure for a comparable suburban shopping center would be $ 200 . </s>
<s> Three other Haagen shopping centers in the Watts area are doing almost as well . </s>
<s> A successful low-crime mall in a high-crime area violates the more typical inner-city pattern , in which commercial areas are taken over by unruly youth , gangs , and the criminal element , with an erosion of the customer base , development capital , and insurability . </s>
<s> Major regional and national chain stores are replaced by mom-and-pop operations offering poorer-quality merchandise at higher prices . </s>
<s> Along with the exodus of shopping opportunities is an exodus of the jobs that the major chains used to provide to community residents . </s>
<s> Thus there is even more to the Vermont-Slauson Center than a good place to shop . </s>
<s> This defensible commercial zone becomes , for the residents , a secure oasis in a barren urban landscape , evidence that community decay is not inevitable and that the gangs are not invincible . </s>
<s> The center improves the community image to outsiders as well , and may help to arrest , or even reverse , the exodus of capital and investment . </s>
<s> An additional benefit is the creation of jobs . </s>
<s> This starts in the construction phase through the use of minority contractors and local workers . </s>
<s> It continues through the life of the center ; the Vermont-Slauson Center has created 500 permanent private-sector jobs at a one-time cost in public funds of only $ 2,500 per job . </s>
<s> As many of these jobs are filled by local residents , who move from the welfare rolls to the tax rolls , the $ 2,500-per-job public investment should repay itself in a few years . </s>
<s> And that is before consideration of increased state and local revenues from taxes and fees on sales , real estate , licenses and the like . </s>
<s> Profits are also plowed back into the community ; the non-profit Vermont-Slauson Economic Development Corp. receives 60 % of the profits from the Vermont-Slauson Center and uses the money to provide moderate and low-cost housing in the community -- now running into the hundreds of units -- as well as commercial and industrial development projects . </s>
<s> Bradford Crowe , director of the mayor 's City Economic Development Office , says : `` There is no question that Vermont-Slauson had a halo effect on the surrounding neighborhood . </s>
<s> What had been a deteriorated area with nothing but wig shops and shoe shops is now experiencing a major upgrading in the housing and commercial stock , thanks to a continuously replenished source of revitalization capital that Vermont-Slauson yields . '' </s>
<s> Another benefit is that substantial percentages of the proprietors in these centers are minority businessmen and women . </s>
<s> In the Grand Boulevard Plaza developed by Matanky Realty Group in Chicago 's Third Ward , opposite the Robert Taylor Homes , 29 % of the stores to date have been leased to blacks and 14 % to members of other minority groups . </s>
<s> Children from the community will have worthier role models than the drug kingpins . </s>
<s> So what 's the catch ? </s>
<s> Primarily that putting one of these inner-city deals together takes time , patience , breadth of vision and negotiating skills that not all developers possess . </s>
<s> Security costs are also quite high . </s>
<s> One of these centers can involve years of negotiating with numerous public agencies , local political leaders , and citizen groups , and with prospective tenants and sources of financing . </s>
<s> Suburban deals are not without their delays and complications -- inner-city deals just have more of them . </s>
<s> Security at a typical Haagen inner-city center is impressive , but unobtrusive . </s>
<s> The entire site is enclosed by a 6-to-8-foot-high ornamental iron fence with a small number of remote-controlled gates . </s>
<s> Shrubs and flowers give it a pleasing and non-fortress-like appearance . </s>
<s> Infrared motion detectors and closed-circuit TV cameras monitor the entire center ; lighting levels are three to five times the industry standard . </s>
<s> The security command post , camouflaged as second-story retail space , has its own `` crow 's nest '' above the roofs of the other buildings , with a panoramic view of the entire center . </s>
<s> Local law enforcement is present in a sub-station occupying space donated by the center . </s>
<s> These features are also used in Matanky Realty Group 's Grand Boulevard Plaza . </s>
<s> Haagen has its own large security force of well-trained and well-paid personnel on round-the-clock duty at each center . </s>
<s> Security is 60 % to 70 % of the common area charges of these centers , vs. an industry average of about 15 % . </s>
<s> These security costs are kept off-budget because the centers ' site acquisition , construction , and financing costs were reduced by such programs as Urban Development Action Grants , Economic Development Administration Grants , Community Development Block Grants , tax-free Industrial Development Bonds , Enterprise Zone tax write-offs , city infrastructure grants , and tax increment financing . </s>
<s> Many of these programs no longer exist , or have been severely cut back . </s>
<s> However , since these centers appear to pay for themselves , there is nothing to prevent state and local governments from enacting legislation with similar provisions . </s>
<s> Many states already have Enterprise Zones and legislation that combines tax incentives , loans , and grants to encourage investment in depressed areas with requirements for the hiring of the unemployed and minorities . </s>
<s> These programs could be expanded to focus on funds for project planning , identifying sources of funds , and for acquiring a site and preparing it . </s>
<s> Combatting crime and the fear of it in inner-city commercial areas should give Enterprise Zones more success than most have enjoyed to date . </s>
<s> With many suburban areas basically overbuilt with shopping centers , inner-city areas may represent a major new untapped market for investment . </s>
<s> New approaches to mall design and operation make it possible to tap these markets . </s>
<s> If the risks and rewards are reasonable , developers will respond . </s>
<s> Government officials who wonder how important it is for them to encourage development in high-risk areas should visit Vermont-Slauson and Grand Boulevard Plaza and decide for themselves . </s>
<s> The answer will be obvious . </s>
<s> Mr. Titus is a researcher at the Justice Department 's National Institute of Justice . </s>
