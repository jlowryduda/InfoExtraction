<s> Ford Motor Co. and Saab-Scania AB of Sweden broke off talks about a possible alliance after Ford officials concluded that the cost to modernize Saab 's car operations would outweigh the likely return . </s>
<s> With the collapse of the talks Friday , European analysts expect Ford to intensify its pursuit of British luxury car maker Jaguar PLC , which is scrambling to fend off a hostile Ford bid by negotiating a friendly alliance with Ford 's archrival , General Motors Corp . </s>
<s> Saab , meanwhile , is left to continue its search for an ally to shore up its sagging car business . </s>
<s> Saab said last week it `` has had and will continue to have contacts with other manufacturers . '' </s>
<s> Among the possible suitors is Italy 's Fiat S.p . A , analysts said last week . </s>
<s> Ford and Saab officials declined to elaborate publicly on the announcement Friday that their negotiations failed to yield an agreement `` that could make long-term business sense to both parties . '' </s>
<s> Individuals close to the Ford side of the negotiations said late last week that the No. 2 U.S. auto maker lost interest as it became clear that the Swedish auto maker 's automotive operations had little to offer in the way of image or technology . </s>
<s> Ford originally had seen a Saab alliance as a way to expand its presence in the European and U.S. luxury car markets . </s>
<s> In addition , Ford and Saab had discussed a possible link between their heavy truck operations . </s>
<s> But the talks on a heavy truck alliance apparently did n't go far . </s>
<s> Some European analysts speculated that officials of Saab 's highly profitable Scania truck operation balked at surrendering any of their autonomy . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , Ford officials became convinced they could n't expect to recover the investment it would require to make Saab 's cars competitive in the increasingly crowded luxury market . </s>
<s> Saab 's problems were underscored Friday when the company announced that its car division had a 1.2 billion kronor -LRB- $ 186.1 million -RRB- loss during the first eight months of this year , slightly worse than Saab-Scania had forecast in its first-half report last month . </s>
<s> Overall , Saab-Scania 's pretax profit during the first eight months of the year plunged 48.9 % to 1 billion Swedish kronor -LRB- $ 155.1 million -RRB- from 1.96 billion kronor -LRB- $ 303.9 million -RRB- a year earlier . </s>
<s> Industry analysts in Europe said the most likely suitor for Saab now is Fiat . </s>
<s> Saab and Fiat have worked together in the past , in one case developing jointly a new auto chassis that became the foundation of Saab 's 9000 model , Fiat 's Croma and Lancia 's Thema . </s>
<s> Last month , Saab-Scania Chief Executive Georg Karnsund said his company has had talks with Fiat about a broader alliance . </s>
<s> But the talks yielded `` nothing so advanced that we needed to make a public announcement about it , '' he said . </s>
<s> As for Ford , analysts expect the end of the Saab play will allow the U.S. auto maker to focus its resources on the intensifying struggle with GM for a stake in Jaguar . </s>
<s> The failure of the Saab talks `` makes it even more crucial for -LCB- Ford -RCB- to be victorious '' in the Jaguar contest , said Stephen Reitman , European auto industry analyst at UBS-Phillips & Drew in London . </s>
<s> Ford faces an uphill fight for Jaguar , however . </s>
<s> Jaguar executives said last week they expect to have a friendly alliance with GM wrapped up by the end of the month . </s>
<s> GM , meanwhile , is hosting a delegation of members of the British Parliament who are touring the auto maker 's headquarter operations in Detroit . </s>
<s> A GM spokesman said the visit is n't connected to the Jaguar situation . </s>
<s> But Ford clearly views Jaguar as a prize worth fighting for , since the company 's gilded brand image would give Ford a badly needed leg up in the high end of the luxury markets in both Europe and the U.S. . </s>
<s> Last week , Ford encountered a setback in its effort to broaden its U.S. luxury offerings when it was forced to abandon a four-year-old effort to market its German-built Scorpio sedan in the U.S. as a luxury import under the Merkur brand name . </s>
<s> So despite the GM-Jaguar romance , analysts say Ford by last Friday had boosted its Jaguar holding to about 11 % of the luxury auto maker 's shares outstanding from 10.4 % early last week . </s>
<s> About 5.4 million Jaguar shares changed hands in active trading on London 's stock exchange Friday , and Jaguar shares moved up 19 pence to 696 pence -LRB- $ 11 -RRB- . </s>
<s> On the U.S. over-the-counter market , Jaguar 's American depositary receipts rose 12.5 cents to $ 11.125 . </s>
