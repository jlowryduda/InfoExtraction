<s> For bankers and regulators , Arizona is looking more like Texas every day . </s>
<s> On Friday , Los Angeles-based First Interstate Bancorp said it expects a net loss of $ 16 million for the third quarter of 1989 because of hemorrhaging at its First Interstate Bank of Arizona unit . </s>
<s> First Interstate said the unit , bludgeoned by Arizona 's worsening real-estate woes , will have a $ 174 million loss for the quarter . </s>
<s> First Interstate took a huge $ 350 million provision for loan losses at the Arizona bank . </s>
<s> It charged off an estimated $ 200 million of Arizona loans , leaving the unit with a reserve for future losses of $ 255 million , about 61 % of its $ 416 million of troubled loans and repossessed real estate . </s>
<s> First Interstate made the move under pressure from regulators . </s>
<s> The action capped a spurt of grim Arizona banking news for the third quarter , and emphatically signaled that Arizona is challenging Texas 's long reign as banking 's busiest graveyard . </s>
<s> Earlier last week , Valley National Corp. , the state 's largest locally owned banking company , reported a $ 72.2 million loss and suspended its dividend . </s>
<s> Pinnacle West Capital Corp. , which has been wrangling with regulators for months over what to do about Pinnacle 's moribund Merabank thrift unit , suspended its dividend and reported a 91 % plunge in third-quarter net income . </s>
<s> Security Pacific Corp. said third-quarter credit losses surged a third to $ 109 million , mainly because of sour Arizona real-estate loans . </s>
<s> New York-based Chase Manhattan Corp. took an $ 85 million Arizona-related charge . </s>
<s> Furthermore , the regulatory maneuvering behind First Interstate 's loss suggests regulators have concluded that lenders ' reserves are far too low to absorb their future Arizona losses and are forcing bankers to do something about it . </s>
<s> Examiners from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency had been combing through First Interstate 's real-estate portfolio since last month ; they first recommended that First Interstate take a provision that was less than the eventual $ 350 million third-quarter hit . </s>
<s> When First Interstate balked , arguing that the figure was too high , regulators responded by raising their recommendation to $ 350 million . </s>
<s> `` At that point , -LCB- First Interstate -RCB- decided it was the better part of valor not to negotiate further , '' said one industry official close to the talks . </s>
<s> Thomas P. Marrie , chief financial officer , would n't comment about the details of the negotiations . </s>
<s> He said the provision `` was n't forced upon us , but the regulators made it very clear what they thought was an appropriate number . '' </s>
<s> The tough regulatory stance portends large future losses , especially at the state 's thrifts . </s>
<s> At least six of Arizona 's 12 savings and loan institutions have either been taken over by the government 's conservatorship program or are essentially insolvent ; they are sitting on enormous unrecognized losses . </s>
<s> For example , Western Savings & Loan Association , which is now in conservatorship , had tangible capital-assets minus liabilities -- of a negative $ 357.4 million at June 30 . </s>
<s> It had a $ 258.9 million loss in the second quarter . </s>
<s> Yet it still held $ 916.3 million of repossessed real estate , for which it maintains no reserves whatsoever . </s>
<s> It also had $ 479.7 million of past-due loans ; its level of reserves against those was n't immediately available , though it is believed to be small . </s>
<s> The rapid deterioration of the Arizona thrifts only adds to the ever-swelling cost of the government 's massive thrift bailout , officially estimated at about $ 166 billion . </s>
<s> Together , the six government-controlled or essentially insolvent Arizona thrifts have tangible capital of a negative $ 1.5 billion , foreclosed property of $ 1.8 billion and pastdue loans of $ 1.63 billion . </s>
<s> They have no reserves against the real estate , and their reserves against the loans are miniscule compared with the levels of reserves banks are moving to set up . </s>
<s> The thrifts had a combined loss of $ 487.8 million in the second quarter . </s>
<s> Other lenders have been recovering only 50 cents to 60 cents on the dollar on foreclosed Arizona property , if they can sell it at all . </s>
<s> All this havoc is the result of one of the worst busts in Arizona 's boom-and-bust history , compounded by some of the usual suspects in 1980s banking debacles : greed , fraud and plain bad banking . </s>
<s> In the late 1970s and early 1980s , lenders and developers poured money into office buildings , condominiums and massive tracts of raw desert land , confident that Arizona 's population would grow at annual rates of 4 % to 6 % for years to come . </s>
<s> Now , annual population growth is running at about 2 % a year , some desert tracts bought three years ago for $ 90,000 an acre are being sold at $ 25,000 an acre and Phoenix has a seven-year supply of unoccupied office space . </s>
<s> `` It 's horrible to say , but it 's unfortunate that earthquake was n't in Phoenix -- it might have knocked out some of our empty buildings , '' said C.W. Jackson , a prominent Arizona businessman with interests in real estate , banking and many other businesses . </s>
<s> Many Arizona real-estate experts think the worst may be yet to come . </s>
<s> Ralph Shattuck , publisher of Foreclosure Update newsletter , said foreclosures have climbed to about 1,482 a month just in Maricopa County , where Phoenix is located . </s>
<s> That 's up from about 687 a month in 1985 , and it 's accelerating : So far this month , foreclosures are averaging about 85 a day . </s>
<s> `` It 's frightening , '' Mr. Shattuck said . </s>
<s> Moreover , Mr. Shattuck and others said residential real estate , which had remained fairly strong through most of the downturn , is beginning to comprise more and more of the foreclosures . </s>
<s> And the generally frail condition of Arizona 's lenders means there is little capital available in the state to shore up the economy and slow down the slide . </s>
<s> `` It 's reasonable to say there is not a solvent S&L in the state and the amount of viable bank capital is very low , '' said Mr. Jackson . </s>
<s> `` We 're going to see another big wave of failures and defaults between now and year-end ... . </s>
<s> The only thing a lot of these lenders can get out of their mouth now is : ` Pay me in 60 days . ' '' </s>
<s> First Interstate had a $ 214.4 million loss in 1988 's third quarter , mainly from writedowns and reserves connected with its Texas operations . </s>
<s> For the six months ended June 30 , it reported net income of $ 234.3 million , or $ 4.83 a share , including $ 46 million from tax credits and accounting changes . </s>
<s> The bank 's Arizona unit holds about $ 6 billion of First Interstate 's $ 50 billion of assets . </s>
<s> Mr. Marrie said the bank expects Arizona real-estate prices , which plummeted 40 % over the last year , to fall another 20 % before stabilizing . </s>
<s> Some in Arizona think that may be optimistic . </s>
<s> First Interstate said its operations outside of Arizona `` achieved results as expected for the quarter , '' but did n't specify the results . </s>
<s> First Interstate stock closed at $ 57.625 , down 25 cents , in composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange . </s>
<s> Since its unsuccessful bid for BankAmerica Corp. in 1986 , the bank has undertaken a major restructuring in an effort to cut costs and boost performance , but many industry officials believe it may be ripe for a takeover bid , especially with interstate banking set to begin in California in 1991 . </s>
<s> Mr. Marrie said the problems in Arizona have only `` increased our resolve to continue to make our restructuring even more effective . '' </s>
<s> Separately , Standard & Poor 's Corp. lowered its ratings on Valley National Corp. 's senior debt to double-B from double-B-plus , affecting about $ 300 million of long-term debt . </s>
<s> S&P also lowered ratings on unsecured deposits and issues backed by a letter of credit from the bank holding company 's principal unit , Valley National Bank of Arizona . </s>
<s> The ratings service said the downgrades reflect the continued slide in the company 's financial condition . </s>
<s> A spokesman for Phoenix , Ariz.-based Valley National , said the concern will be able to withstand the current downturn in Arizona real estate . </s>
<s> Commercial paper holders have reinvested their funds , he said , and consumer deposits have been up in the last few days . </s>
