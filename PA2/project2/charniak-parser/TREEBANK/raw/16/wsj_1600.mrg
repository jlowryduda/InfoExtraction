<s> When it comes to buying and selling shares , Westridge Capital Management Inc. takes a back seat to no one . </s>
<s> Every dollar 's worth of stock in the Los Angeles money manager 's portfolio is traded seven or eight times a year , the firm estimates . </s>
<s> That makes it the most active trader among all the nation 's investment advisers , according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings . </s>
<s> But wait a second . </s>
<s> Westridge Capital is an index fund -- the type of stolid long-term investor whose goal is to be nothing more than average . </s>
<s> Westridge Capital 's frenetic trading reflects the changes sweeping through the previously sleepy world of indexing . </s>
<s> Indexing for the most part has involved simply buying and then holding stocks in the correct mix to mirror a stock market barometer , such as Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index , and match its performance . </s>
<s> Institutional investors have poured $ 210 billion into stock and bond indexing as a cheap and easy form of investment management that promises to post average market returns . </s>
<s> These big investors have flocked to indexing because relatively few `` active '' stock pickers have been able to consistently match the returns of the S&P 500 or other bellwethers , much less beat it . </s>
<s> And the fees investors pay for indexing run a few pennies for each $ 100 of assets -- a fraction of the cost of active managers . </s>
<s> That 's because computers do most of the work , and low trading activity keeps a lid on commission costs . </s>
<s> But today , indexing is moving from a passive investment strategy to an increasingly active one . </s>
<s> Because index-fund managers are no longer satisfied with merely being average , they have developed `` enhanced '' indexing strategies that are intended to outperform the market as much as three percentage points . </s>
<s> `` Indexing has been the most single successful investment concept in the last decade , but the index money has been just sort of sitting there , '' says Seth M. Lynn , president of Axe Core Investors Inc. , an indexer based in Tarrytown , N.Y . </s>
<s> `` Now the interest is in what else can I do with that money . '' </s>
<s> Among the souped-up indexing strategies : Indexed portfolios can be built around thousands of stocks , or just a few dozen , rather than being restricted to the S&P 500 companies . </s>
<s> They can ignore the S&P 500 stocks altogether and focus on particular types of stocks , such as smaller companies , those paying high dividends or companies in a particular industry , state or country . </s>
<s> With today 's computer-driven program trading techniques , index funds can trade back and forth between stock-index futures and the actual stocks making up indexes such as the S&P 500 . </s>
<s> Futures and options also make it possible to build `` synthetic '' index funds that do n't actually own a single share of stock , but can produce returns that match or exceed the broad stock market . </s>
<s> One reason for these hybrids is that indexing 's rapid growth is slowing , particularly for those `` plain vanilla '' funds that mirror the S&P 500 . </s>
<s> `` There is n't a boatload -LCB- of big investors -RCB- out there still waiting to get into indexing , '' says P. James Kartalia , vice president of ANB Investment Management Co. , Chicago , which offers both indexing and active management services . </s>
<s> -LRB- After tripling in size in the past five years , index funds now hold about 20 % of the stock owned by pension funds . -RRB- </s>
<s> A further problem is razor-thin profits . </s>
<s> Plain-vanilla funds have become so commonplace that fees they can charge have plunged to almost nothing , and in some cases are just that . </s>
<s> To land customers for their well-paying stock custodial business , big banks sometimes will throw in basic indexing services for free . </s>
<s> `` It 's like getting a free toaster when you open an account , '' says Axe Core 's Mr. Lynn . </s>
<s> As a result , indexers have been looking for ways to give investors something more than the average for their money . </s>
<s> And many have been successful , as in the case of the index fund operated by hyper-trader Westridge Capital . </s>
<s> Westridge Capital has used enhanced indexing techniques to beat the S&P 500 's returns by 2.5 to 3 percentage points over the past four years , with the same risk level as holding the S&P 500 stocks , according to James Carder , the firm 's president . </s>
<s> Strategies vary for Westridge Capital , which has $ 300 million under management . </s>
<s> The firm sometimes buys S&P 500 futures when they are selling at a discount to the actual stocks , and will switch back and forth between stocks and stock-index futures to take advantages of any momentary price discrepencies . </s>
<s> Mr. Carder also goes through periods when he buys stocks in conjunction with options to boost returns and protect against declines . </s>
<s> And in some months , he buys stock-index futures and not stocks at all . </s>
<s> `` By their nature , our trades are very short-term and are going to create high turnover , '' Mr. Carder adds . </s>
<s> `` The more turnover , the better for our clients . '' </s>
<s> Big indexer Bankers Trust Co. also uses futures in a strategy that on average has added one percentage point to its enhanced fund 's returns . </s>
<s> J. Thomas Allen , president of Pittsburgh-based Advanced Investment Management Inc. , agrees it 's a good idea to jump between the S&P 500 stocks and futures . </s>
<s> `` You 're buying the S&P , and you always want to hold the cheapest form of it , '' he says . </s>
<s> But some indexers make little or no use of futures , saying that these instruments present added risks for investors . </s>
<s> `` If the futures markets have a problem , then those products could have a problem , '' says John Zumbrunn , managing director of Prudential Insurance Co. of America 's Investment Index Technologies Inc. unit . </s>
<s> Prudential currently is seeking approval to offer a new fund offering a return equal to the S&P 500 index plus 5\/100 of a percentage point . </s>
<s> An added feature is that the slighty improved return would be guaranteed by Prudential . </s>
<s> There are many other strategies to bolster the returns of index funds . </s>
<s> They include : </s>
<s> LIMITED RISK FUNDS : </s>
<s> These guarantee protection against stock market declines while still passing along most gains . </s>
<s> Here a fund may promise to pay back , say , $ 95 of every $ 100 invested for a year , even if the market goes much lower . </s>
<s> The fund could invest $ 87 for one year in Treasury bills yielding 8 % to return the guaranteed $ 95 . </s>
<s> That leaves $ 13 , which could be used to buy S&P 500 options that will nearly match any gain in the S&P index . </s>
<s> MANAGER REPLICATION FUNDS : </s>
<s> Say a big investor is interested in growth stocks . </s>
<s> Instead of hiring one of the many active managers specializing in growth stocks , indexers can design a portfolio around the same stocks ; the portfolio will be maintained by computer , reducing both fees and , in theory , risk -LRB- because of the large number of stocks -RRB- . </s>
<s> `` We see a lot of interest in those kind of things , '' says Frank Salerno , a vice president of Bankers Trust . </s>
<s> `` People comfortable with the passive approach are using them for other strategies . '' </s>
<s> TILT FUNDS : </s>
<s> This is an index fund with a bet . </s>
<s> Instead of replicating the S&P 500 or some other index exactly , some stocks are overweighted or underweighted in the portfolio . </s>
<s> One simple approach is to exclude S&P 500 companies considered bankruptcy candidates ; this can avoid weak sisters , but also can hurt when a company like Chrysler Corp. rebounds . </s>
<s> Another approach : An investor with $ 100 million might use $ 75 million to buy the S&P 500 index and spend the other $ 25 million on a favorite group of stocks . </s>
<s> SPECIALIZED FUNDS : </s>
<s> Indexes can be constructed to serve social goals , such as eliminating the stocks of companies doing business in South Africa . </s>
<s> Other funds have been designed to concentrate on stocks in a geographic area in order to encourage local investment . </s>
<s> Pennsylvania State Employees Retirement System , for example , has about $ 130 million invested in a fund of 244 companies that are either Pennsylvania-based or have 25 % of their work forces in the state . </s>
