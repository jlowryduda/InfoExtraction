<s> Westmoreland Coal Co. , realizing benefits of a sustained effort to cut costs and boost productivity , reported sharply improved third-quarter results . </s>
<s> The producer and marketer of low-sulfur coal said net income for the quarter was $ 5.9 million , or 71 cents a share , on revenue of $ 145.4 million . </s>
<s> For the year-earlier period , the company reported a loss of $ 520,000 or six cents a share . </s>

<s> Revenue for the nine months rose to $ 449 million from $ 441.1 million . </s>
<s> In an interview , Pemberton Hutchinson , president and chief executive , cited several reasons for the improvement : higher employee productivity and `` good natural conditions '' in the mines , as well as lower costs for materials , administrative overhead and debt interest . </s>
<s> In the latest nine months , Mr. Hutchinson said , total coal sales rose to about 14.6 million tons from about 14.3 million tons a year earlier . </s>
<s> In addition , long-term debt has been trimmed to about $ 72 million from $ 96 million since Jan. 1 . </s>

<s> Westmoreland 's strategy is to retain and expand its core business of mining and selling low-sulphur coal in the Appalachia region . </s>
<s> The operating territory includes coal terminals on the Ohio River and in Newport News , Va . </s>
<s> Westmoreland exports about a fourth of its coal tonnage , including a significant amount of metallurgical coal produced by others that is used by steelmakers overseas . </s>
<s> For the past couple of years , Westmoreland has undertaken an aggressive streamlining of all aspects of its business . </s>
<s> Marginal operations and assets have been sold . </s>
<s> The size of the company 's board has been reduced to eight directors from 13 . </s>
<s> About 140 salaried management jobs and hundreds of hourly wage positions have been eliminated . </s>
<s> Even perks have been reduced . </s>
<s> For example , the chief executive himself now pays 20 % of the cost of his health benefits ; the company used to pay 100 % . </s>
<s> `` I think the ship is now righted , the bilges are pumped and we are on course , '' Mr. Hutchinson said of the restructuring program . </s>
<s> `` Much of what we set out to do is completed . '' </s>
<s> But he cautioned that Westmoreland 's third quarter is typically better than the fourth , so investors `` should n't just multiply the third quarter by four '' and assume the same rate of improvement can be sustained . </s>
<s> One difference , he said , is that the fourth quarter has significantly fewer workdays because of holidays and the hunting season . </s>
<s> `` I do n't want to give the impression that everybody can relax now , '' he said . </s>
<s> `` We have to keep working at improving our core business to stay efficient . </s>

<s> An accounting adjustment made net income $ 1.5 million , or 18 cents a share . </s>
<s> In a move that complements the company 's basic strategy , its Westmoreland Energy Inc. unit is developing four coal-fired cogeneration plants with a partner in Virginia . </s>
<s> Some of the coal the plants buy will come from Westmoreland mines . </s>
<s> Mr. Hutchinson predicted that the unit 's contribution to company results in the 1990s `` will be exciting . '' </s>
<s> He said Westmoreland is looking at investment stakes in other cogeneration plants east of the Mississippi River . </s>
<s> Westmoreland expects energy demand to grow annually in the 2.5 % range in the early 1990s . </s>
<s> `` We see coal 's piece of the action growing , '' Mr. Hutchinson said . </s>
<s> `` Coal prices , while not skyrocketing , will grow modestly in real terms , we think . </s>
