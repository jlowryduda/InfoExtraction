<s> After watching interest in the sport plummet for years , the ski industry is trying to give itself a lift . </s>
<s> Across the country , resorts are using everything from fireworks to classical-music concerts to attract new customers . </s>
<s> Some have built health spas , business centers and shopping villages so visitors have more to do than ski . </s>
<s> And this week , the industry 's efforts will go national for the first time when it unveils a $ 7 million advertising campaign . </s>
<s> Such efforts -- unheard of only a few years ago -- are the latest attempts to revive the sagging $ 1.76 billion U.S. ski industry . </s>
<s> Since the start of the decade , lift-ticket sales have grown only 3 % a year on average , compared with 16 % annual growth rates in the '60s and '70s . </s>
<s> Last season , lift-ticket sales fell for the first time in seven years . </s>
<s> By some estimates , nearly a fourth of all U.S. ski areas have been forced to shut down since the early '80s . </s>
<s> Competition and mounting insurance and equipment costs have been the undoing of many resorts . </s>
<s> But another big problem has been the aging of baby boomers . </s>
<s> Skiing , after all , has mainly been for the young and daring and many baby boomers have outgrown skiing or have too many family responsibilities to stick with the sport . </s>
<s> In its new ad campaign , created by D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles Inc. , Chicago , the ski industry is trying to change its image as a sport primarily for young white people . </s>
<s> One 60-second TV spot features a diverse group of skiers gracefully gliding down sun-drenched slopes : senior citizens , minorities , families with children -- even a blind skier . </s>
<s> `` Ski school is great , '' cries out a tot , bundled in a snowsuit as he plows down a bunny slope . </s>
<s> `` You 'll never know 'til you try , '' says a black skier . </s>
<s> `` We used to show some hot-dog skier in his twenties or thirties going over the edge of a cliff , '' says Kathe Dillmann , a spokeswoman for the United Ski Industries Association , the trade group sponsoring the campaign . </s>
<s> Ski promotions have traditionally avoided the touchy issue of safety . </s>
<s> But the new commercials deal with it indirectly by showing a woman smiling as she tries to get up from a fall . </s>
<s> `` We wanted to show it 's okay if you fall , '' says Ms. Dillmann . </s>
<s> `` Most people think if you slip , you 'll wind up in a body cast . '' </s>
<s> The ad campaign represents an unusual spirit of cooperation among resorts and ski equipment makers ; normally , they only run ads hyping their own products and facilities . </s>
<s> But in these crunch times for the ski industry , some resorts , such as the Angel Fire , Red River and Taos ski areas in New Mexico , have even started shuttle-busing skiers to each other 's slopes and next year plan to sell tickets good for all local lifts . </s>
<s> Many resorts also are focusing more on the service side of their business . </s>
<s> Since 40 % of skiers are parents , many slopes are building nurseries , expanding ski schools and adding entertainment for kids . </s>
<s> Vail , Colo. , now has a playland that looks like an old mining town ; kids can ski through and pan for fool 's gold . </s>
<s> For $ 15 , they can enjoy their own nightly entertainment , with dinner , without mom and dad . </s>
<s> A few years ago , parents usually had to hire a sitter or take turns skiing while one spouse stayed with the children . </s>
<s> `` Most parents who had to go through that never came back , '' says Michael Shannon , president of Vail Associates Inc. , which owns and operates the Vail and nearby Beaver Creek resorts . </s>
<s> To make skiing more convenient for time-strapped visitors , several resorts are buying or starting their own travel agencies . </s>
<s> In one phone call , ski buffs can make hotel and restaurant reservations , buy lift tickets , rent ski equipment and sign up for lessons . </s>
<s> And resorts are adding other amenities , such as pricey restaurants , health spas and vacation packages with a twist . </s>
<s> During Winter Carnival week , for example , visitors at Sunday River in Maine can take a hot-air balloon ride . </s>
<s> `` People these days want something else to do besides ski and sit in the bar , '' says Don Borgeson , executive director of Angel Fire , N.M. 's Chamber of Commerce . </s>
<s> The ski industry hopes to increase the number of skiers by 3.5 million to about 21.7 million in the next five years with its latest ads and promotions . </s>
<s> But some think that 's being overly optimistic . </s>
<s> For one thing , it may be tough to attract people because skiing is still expensive : a lift ticket can cost up to $ 35 a day and equipment prices are rising . </s>
<s> And most vacationers still prefer a warm climate for their winter excursions . </s>
<s> An American Express Co. survey of its travel agents revealed that only 34 % believe their clients will pick a trip this winter based on the availability of winter sports , as opposed to 69 % who think that warm-weather sports will be the deciding factor . </s>
<s> `` Even if they could bring in that many new skiers , I do n't know if -LCB- the industry -RCB- could handle that kind of an increase , '' says I. William Berry , editor and publisher of the Ski Industry Letter in Katonah , N.Y . </s>
<s> `` Most people will come on the weekend , the slopes will be overcrowded and then these -LCB- new skiers -RCB- wo n't come back . </s>
