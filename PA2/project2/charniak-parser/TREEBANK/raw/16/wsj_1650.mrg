<s> `` Japan has been a major importer of foreign information and news , '' says Mr. Shioya . </s>
<s> `` But one gets fed up with importing information and news . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Shioya has turned the tables . </s>
<s> Today , he is publisher of Business Tokyo magazine , the first English-language business magazine devoted to coverage of Japanese business . </s>
<s> After a slick redesign , the two-year-old magazine has been relaunched this month by its parent company , Keizaikai Corp. , the Tokyo-based company with interests that include financial services , book publishing and a tourist agency . </s>
<s> Printed in the U.S. and carrying the line `` The Insider 's Japan , '' Business Tokyo 's October cover story was `` The World 's No. 1 Customer '' -- Japanese women . </s>
<s> Keizaikai is one of a small but growing band of Japanese companies taking their first steps into American publishing , after making major investments in entertainment , real estate and banking companies here . </s>
<s> Japanese concerns have retained a number of publishing consultants and media brokers to study the U.S. market , including the New York-based investment banker Veronis , Suhler & Associates . </s>
<s> And they are quietly linking up with U.S. publishing trade groups . </s>
<s> `` Japanese publishers want to be introduced to the publishing and information industries , '' said John Veronis , chairman of Veronis Suhler . </s>
<s> While there are n't any major deals in the works currently on the scale of Sony Corp. 's recent $ 3.4 billion agreement to buy Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. , observers do n't rule out a transaction of that size . </s>
<s> `` The Japanese take the long view . '' said Mr. Veronis . </s>
<s> `` It may not be weeks or months , but they are also opportunistic and if they feel comfortable , they will move on a deal , '' he said . </s>
<s> In recent months , three big Tokyo-based publishing concerns -- including Nikkei Business Publications , Nikkei Home -LRB- no relation -RRB- , and Magazine House -- applied for membership in Magazine Publishers of America , which represents almost all U.S. consumer magazines . </s>
<s> Japanese involvement in American publishing has been so small to date that magazines such as Business Tokyo are considered groundbreakers . </s>
<s> When Keizaikai launched Business Tokyo in 1987 , it appealed to a more multinational audience . </s>
<s> The magazine was overhauled with the aid of American magazine design gurus Milton Glaser and Walter Bernard , and targets top-level U.S. executives with Japanese and American advertisers . </s>
<s> American publishers appear more than ready to do some selling . </s>
<s> Susumu Ohara , president of Nihon Keizai Shinbun America Inc. , publisher of the Japan Economic Journal , said he receives telephone calls weekly from media bankers on whether his parent company is interested in buying a U.S. consumer or business magazine . </s>
<s> `` The Japanese are in the early stage right now , '' said Thomas Kenney , a onetime media adviser for First Boston Corp. who was recently appointed president of Reader 's Digest Association 's new Magazine Publishing Group . </s>
<s> `` Before , they were interested in hard assets and they saw magazines as soft . </s>
<s> Now they realize magazines are as much a franchise as Nabisco is a franchise . </s>
