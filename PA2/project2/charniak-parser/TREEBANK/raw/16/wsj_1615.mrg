<s> Heidi Ehman might have stepped from a recruiting poster for young Republicans . </s>
<s> White , 24 years old , a singer in her church choir , she symbolizes a generation that gave its heart and its vote to Ronald Reagan . </s>
<s> `` I felt kind of safe , '' she says . </s>
<s> No longer . </s>
<s> When the Supreme Court opened the door this year to new restrictions on abortion , Ms. Ehman opened her mind to Democratic politics . </s>
<s> Then a political novice , she stepped into a whirl of `` pro-choice '' marches , house parties and fund-raisers . </s>
<s> Now she leads a grassroots abortion-rights campaign in Passaic County for pro-choice Democratic gubernatorial candidate James Florio . </s>
<s> `` This is one where I cross party lines , '' she says , rejecting the anti-abortion stance of Rep. Florio 's opponent , Reagan-Republican Rep. James Courter . </s>
<s> `` People my age thought it was n't going to be an issue . </s>
<s> Now it has -- especially for people my age . '' </s>
<s> Polls bear out this warning , but after a decade of increased Republican influence here , the new politics of abortion have contributed to a world turned upside down for Mr. Courter . </s>
<s> Unless he closes the gap , Republicans risk losing not only the governorship but also the assembly next month . </s>
<s> Going into the 1990s , the GOP is paying a price for the same conservative social agenda that it used to torment Democrats in the past . </s>
<s> This change comes less from a shift in public opinion , which has n't changed much on abortion over the past decade , than in the boundaries of the debate . </s>
<s> New Jersey 's own highest court remains a liberal bulwark against major restrictions on abortion , but the U.S. Supreme Court ruling , Webster vs. Missouri , has engaged voters across the nation who had been insulated from the issue . </s>
<s> Before July , pro-choice voters could safely make political decisions without focusing narrowly on abortion . </s>
<s> Now , the threat of further restrictions adds a new dimension , bringing an upsurge in political activity by abortion-rights forces . </s>
<s> A recent pro-choice rally in Trenton drew thousands , and in a major reversal , Congress is defying a presidential veto and demanding that Medicaid abortions be permitted in cases of rape and incest . </s>
<s> `` If Webster had n't happened , you would n't be here , '' Linda Bowker tells a reporter in the Trenton office of the National Organization for Women . </s>
<s> `` We could have shouted from the rooftops about Courter ... and no one would have heard us . '' </s>
<s> New Jersey is a proving ground for this aggressive women's-rights movement this year . </s>
<s> The infusion of activists can bring a clash of cultures . </s>
<s> In Cherry Hill , the National Abortion Rights Action League , whose goal is to sign up 50,000 pro-choice voters , targets a union breakfast to build labor support for its cause . </s>
<s> The league organizers seem more a fit with a convention next door of young aerobics instructors in leotards than the beefy union leaders ; `` I wish I could go work out , '' says a slim activist . </s>
<s> A labor chief speaks sardonically of having to `` man and woman '' Election Day phones . </s>
<s> No age group is more sensitive than younger voters , like Ms. Ehman . </s>
<s> A year ago this fall , New Jersey voters under 30 favored George Bush by 56 % to 39 % over Michael Dukakis , according to a survey then by Rutgers University 's Eagleton Institute . </s>
<s> A matching Eagleton-Newark Star Ledger poll last month showed a complete reversal . </s>
<s> Voters in the same age group backed Democrat Florio 55 % to 29 % over Republican Courter . </s>
<s> Abortion alone ca n't explain this shift , but New Jersey is a model of how so personal an issue can become a baseline of sorts in judging a candidate . </s>
<s> By a 2-to-1 ratio , voters appear more at ease with Mr. Florio 's stance on abortion , and polls indicate his lead widens when the candidates are specifically linked to the issue . </s>
<s> `` The times are my times , '' says Mr. Florio . </s>
<s> The Camden County congressman still carries himself with a trademark `` I'm-coming-down-your-throat '' intensity , but at a pause in Newark 's Columbus Day parade recently , he was dancing with his wife in the middle of the avenue in the city 's old Italian-American ward . </s>
<s> After losing by fewer than 1,800 votes in the 1981 governor 's race , he has prepared himself methodically for this moment , including deciding in recent years he could no longer support curbs on federal funding for Medicaid abortions . </s>
<s> `` If you 're going to be consistent and say it is a constitutionally protected right , '' he asks , `` how are you going to say an upscale woman who can drive to the hospital or clinic in a nice car has a constitutional right and someone who is not in great shape financially does not ? '' </s>
<s> Mr. Courter , by comparison , seems a shadow of the confident hawk who defended Oliver North before national cameras at Iran-Contra hearings two years ago . </s>
<s> Looking back , he says he erred by stating his `` personal '' opposition to abortion instead of assuring voters that he would n't impose his views on `` policy '' as governor . </s>
<s> It is a distinction that satisfies neither side in the debate . </s>
<s> `` He does n't know himself , '' Kathy Stanwick of the Abortion Rights League says of Mr. Courter 's position . </s>
<s> Even abortion opponents , however angry with Mr. Florio , ca n't hide their frustration with the Republican 's ambivalence . </s>
<s> `` He does n't want to lead the people , '' says Richard Traynor , president of New Jersey Right to Life . </s>
<s> Moreover , by stepping outside the state 's pro-choice tradition , Mr. Courter aggravates fears that he is too conservative as well on more pressing concerns such as auto insurance rates and the environment . </s>
<s> He hurt himself further this summer by bringing homosexual issues into the debate ; and by wavering on this issue and abortion , he has weakened his credibility in what is already a mean-spirited campaign on both sides . </s>
<s> Elected to Congress in 1978 , the 48-year-old Mr. Courter is part of a generation of young conservatives who were once very much in the lead of the rightward shift under Mr. Reagan . </s>
<s> Like many of his colleagues , he did n't serve in Vietnam in the 1960s yet embraced a hawkish defense and foreign policy -- even voting against a 1984 resolution critical of the U.S. mining of Nicaraguan harbors . </s>
<s> Jack Kemp and the writers Irving Kristol and George Gilder were influences , and Mr. Courter 's own conservative credentials proved useful to the current New Jersey GOP governor , Thomas Kean , in the 1981 Republican primary here . </s>
<s> The same partnership is now crucial to Mr. Courter 's fortunes , but the abortion issue is only a reminder of the gap between his record and that of the more moderate , pro-choice Gov. Kean . </s>
<s> While the Warren County congressman pursued an anti-government , anti-tax agenda in Washington , Gov. Kean was approving increased income and sales taxes at home and overseeing a near doubling in the size of New Jersey 's budget in his eight years in office . </s>
<s> Kean forces play down any differences with Mr. Courter , but this history makes it harder for the conservative to run against government . </s>
<s> Mr. Courter 's free-market plan to bring down auto insurance rates met criticism from Gov. Kean 's own insurance commissioner . </s>
<s> Mr. Courter is further hobbled by a record of votes opposed to government regulation on behalf of consumers . </s>
<s> Fluent in Spanish from his days in the Peace Corps , Mr. Courter actively courts minority voters but seems oddly over his head . </s>
<s> He is warm and polished before a Puerto Rican Congress in Asbury Park . </s>
<s> Yet minutes after promising to appoint Hispanics to high posts in state government , he is unable to say whether he has ever employed any in his congressional office . </s>
<s> `` I do n't think we do now , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` I think we did . '' </s>
<s> Asked the same question after his appearance , Democrat Florio identifies a staff member by name and explains her whereabouts today . </s>
<s> When he is presented with a poster celebrating the organization 's 20th anniversary , he recognizes a photograph of one of the founders and recalls time spent together in Camden . </s>
<s> Details and Camden are essential Florio . </s>
<s> Elected to Congress as a `` Watergate baby '' in 1974 , he ran for governor three years later . </s>
<s> In the opinion of many , he has n't stopped running since , even though he declined a rematch with Gov. Kean in 1985 . </s>
<s> His base in South Jersey and on the House Energy and Commerce Committee helped him sustain a network of political-action committees to preserve his edge . </s>
<s> With limited budgets for television in a high-priced market , Mr. Florio 's higher recognition than his rival is a major advantage . </s>
<s> More than ever , his pro-consumer and pro-environment record is in sync with the state . </s>
<s> Auto insurance rates are soaring . </s>
<s> A toxic-waste-dump fire destroyed part of an interstate highway this summer . </s>
<s> In Monmouth , an important swing area , Republican freeholders now run on a slogan promising to keep the county `` clean and green . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Florio savors this vindication , but at age 52 , the congressman is also a product of his times and losses . </s>
<s> He speaks for the death penalty as if reading from Exodus 21 ; to increase state revenue he focuses not on `` taxes '' but on `` audits '' to cut waste . </s>
<s> Hard-hitting consultants match ads with Mr. Courter 's team , and Mr. Florio retools himself as the lean , mean Democratic fighting machine of the 1990s . </s>
<s> Appealing to a young audience , he scraps an old reference to Ozzie and Harriet and instead quotes the Grateful Dead . </s>
<s> The lyric chosen -- `` long strange night '' -- may be an apt footnote to television spots by both candidates intended to portray each other as a liar . </s>
<s> The Democratic lawmaker fits a pattern of younger reformers arising out of old machines , but his ties to Camden remain a sore point because of the county 's past corruption . </s>
<s> His campaign hierarchy is chosen from elsewhere in the state , and faced with criticism of a sweetheart bank investment , he has so far blunted the issue by donating the bulk of his profits to his alma mater , Trenton State College . </s>
<s> Mr. Florio 's forcefulness on the abortion issue after the Webster ruling divides some of his old constituency . </s>
<s> Pasquale Pignatelli , an unlikely but enthusiastic pipe major in an Essex County Irish bagpipe band , speaks sadly of Mr. Florio . </s>
<s> `` I am a devout Catholic , '' says Mr. Pignatelli , a 40-year-old health officer . </s>
<s> `` I ca n't support him because of abortion . '' </s>
<s> Bill Wames Sr. , 72 , is Catholic too , but unfazed by Mr. Florio 's stand on abortion . </s>
<s> A security guard at a cargo terminal , he wears a Sons of Italy jacket and cap celebrating `` The US 1 Band . '' </s>
<s> `` I still think the woman has the right to do with her body as she pleases , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` If you want more opinions ask my wife . </s>
<s> She has lots of opinions . </s>
