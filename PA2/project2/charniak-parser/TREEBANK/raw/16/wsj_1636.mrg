<s> IF YOU FORCE financial planners to sum up their most important advice in a single sentence , it would probably be a one-word sentence : Diversify . </s>
<s> Judging by a poll of Wall Street Journal readers conducted this summer by Erdos & Morgan Inc. , serious investors have taken that advice to heart . </s>
<s> Nearly 1,000 investors responded to the Journal 's poll , providing an in-depth look at their portfolios . </s>
<s> Those portfolios are remarkably diversified . </s>
<s> By spreading their wealth among several investment alternatives , the respondents have protected themselves against squalls in any one area , be it stocks , bonds or real estate . </s>
<s> For example , about 88 % of Journal readers owned stock -LRB- down slightly from 91 % in a similar poll last year -RRB- . </s>
<s> But only 17.5 % said they had more than half their money in the stock market . </s>
<s> Similarly , 57 % of respondents own shares in a money-market mutual fund , and 33 % own municipal bonds . </s>
<s> But only 6 % to 7 % of the investors were committing more than half their funds to either of those alternatives . </s>
<s> The poll , conducted Aug. 7-28 , also provides a glimpse into the thinking of serious investors on a variety of other topics . </s>
<s> It found them in a cautious , but not downbeat , mood . </s>
<s> Of 1,500 people sent a questionnaire , 951 replied . </s>
<s> The response rate , more than 63 % , allows the results to be interpreted with a high degree of confidence . </s>
<s> The results ca n't be extrapolated to all investors , though . </s>
<s> Journal readers are relatively affluent , with a median household income of between $ 75,000 and $ 99,000 . </s>
<s> Nearly half of the respondents -LRB- 47 % -RRB- said their investment portfolio was worth $ 250,000 or more , and 17 % said it was worth $ 1 million or more . </s>
<s> The respondents were mildly optimistic about the economy and investment markets , but their collective judgments were a notch more sober than they were a year ago . </s>
<s> For example , 12 % of this year 's respondents said they expect a recession within 12 months . </s>
<s> Last year , only 8 % were expecting a recession . </s>
<s> An additional 56 % of this year 's respondents expect the economy to slow down during the next 12 months . </s>
<s> Only 42 % of last year 's respondents anticipated slowing growth . </s>
<s> Apparently , the respondents do n't think that an economic slowdown would harm the major investment markets very much . </s>
<s> A slim majority -LRB- 51 % -RRB- think stock prices will be higher in August 1990 than they were in August 1989 . </s>
<s> Their verdict on real estate is almost the same . </s>
<s> Some 50 % expect real estate in their local area to increase in value over the next 12 months . </s>
<s> By contrast , only 32 % expect an increase in the price of gold . </s>
<s> Since gold tends to soar when inflation is high , that finding suggests that people believe inflation remains under control . </s>
<s> Even though only 12 % actually predicted a recession , many respondents were taking a better-safe-than sorry investment stance . </s>
<s> Nearly a third said they have made some portfolio changes to anticipate a possible recession . </s>
<s> For the most part , the changes were `` slight . '' </s>
<s> The two-thirds who have n't tried to make their portfolios more recession-resistant were split about evenly between investors who `` do n't believe in trying to predict the markets '' -LRB- about 31 % -RRB- and investors who `` do n't expect a recession '' -LRB- about 15 % -RRB- or are `` unsure if and when a recession might come '' -LRB- about 22 % -RRB- . </s>
<s> A buy-and-hold approach to stocks continues to be the rule among respondents . </s>
<s> Most own two to 10 stocks , and buy or sell no more than three times a year . </s>
<s> Some 71 % had bought some stock in the past year ; only 57 % had sold any . </s>
<s> But the lurking shadow of 1987 's stock-market crash still seems dark . </s>
<s> About 33 % considered another crash `` likely , '' while about 63 % said one is `` unlikely . '' </s>
<s> Those percentages hardly changed from the previous year 's poll . </s>
<s> And the respondents ' commitment to the stock market remains somewhat lighter than usual . </s>
<s> About 60 % of them said they would `` ordinarily '' have at least 25 % of their money in stocks . </s>
<s> But as of August , only 50 % actually had stock-market investments of that size . </s>
<s> Most stock-market indexes were hitting all-time highs at around the time of the poll . </s>
<s> But it appears that many Journal readers were taking that news as a sign to be cautious , rather than a signal to jump on the bandwagon . </s>
