<s> First they get us to buy computers so we can get more information . </s>
<s> Then the computers give us more information than we can ever read . </s>
<s> Now they plan to sell us products that sift through all the information to give us what we really want to know . </s>
<s> The products range from computer-edited , personal newsletters to systems that sit inside a personal computer and pick stories on selected topics off news wires . </s>
<s> `` Filtered news is what people want , '' says Esther Dyson , editor of Release 1.0 , an industry newsletter that spots new developments . </s>
<s> `` Most people read 10 times more than necessary in order to find out what they really need . '' </s>
<s> Geoffrey Goodfellow , who dropped out of high school back in the 1970s to manage a computer network at a California research firm , says : `` Old network hands have started to turn off the network because they do n't have time to wade through the muck . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Goodfellow has started a Menlo Park , Calif. , company called Anterior Technology that provides human editors for public electronic networks . </s>
<s> `` I see it as a sewage treatment plant , '' he says . </s>
<s> A new product , NewsEdge , carries five business news wires simultaneously into a user 's computer and beeps and flashes whenever an article appears that is of interest to the user . </s>
<s> The product , developed by Desktop Data Corp. , a new company based in Waltham , Mass. , scans the wires looking for articles that contain key words specified by the user . </s>
<s> One early user , David Semmel , a Chicago venture capitalist and investor in Desktop Data , says he uses it to track takeover developments . </s>
<s> He says he told NewsEdge to look for stories containing such words as takeover , acquisition , acquire , LBO , tender , merger , junk and halted . </s>
<s> `` I 'm pretty confident I 'm catching everything , '' he says . </s>
<s> NewsEdge is pricey : $ 7,500 a year for a limited version , $ 40,000 a year if the cost of all the news wires is included . </s>
<s> And it works best in high-powered personal computers . </s>
<s> But some investors and consultants who have tried it are enthusiastic . </s>
<s> Jeffrey Tarter , editor of SoftLetter , a Watertown , Mass. , industry newsletter , says : `` I 've seen a lot of people fooling around on the fringes of filtering information . </s>
<s> This is the first time I 've seen something I could imagine a lot of people using . '' </s>
<s> NewsEdge uses an FM radio band to carry news wires provided by Reuters , McGraw-Hill and Dow Jones & Co. , as well as PR Newswire , which carries corporate press releases . </s>
<s> An FM receiver attached to a user 's personal computer receives the information . </s>
<s> Some organizations have devised their own systems to sort through news wire items as they come in . </s>
<s> George Goodwin , an account manager at Royal Bank of Canada , adapted a Lotus Development Corp. program called Agenda to sort through international news wires . </s>
<s> It automatically selects stories from particular countries for reading by the international bankers responsible for lending in those areas . </s>
<s> For those who do n't need their personalized information moment by moment , some services are offering overnight newsletters . </s>
<s> Individual Inc. , a new company in Brookline , Mass. , uses filtering technology developed by Cornell University computer scientist Gerard Salton , to automatically produce customized newsletters it sends electronically to subscribers by 8 a.m. the next day . </s>
<s> `` We are operating an information refinery that takes a broad stream of raw data and turns it into actionable knowledge , '' says Yosi Amram , founder and president . </s>
<s> The daily newsletter , which is n't widely available yet , will have a base cost of $ 2,000 a year and provides full text of relevant articles under license agreements with Reuters , McGraw Hill , United Press International , two press release news wires and Japan 's Kyodo news service . </s>
<s> One early user is NEC Corp. 's U.S. printer marketing arm . </s>
<s> `` They want the full press releases on printer announcements by their competition , '' Mr. Amram says . </s>
<s> It also tracks personnel and financial announcements by NEC 's distributors and customers . </s>
<s> Individual Inc. 's technology goes beyond word searches by using a computerized thesaurus . </s>
<s> If a customer asks for stories about `` IBM , '' the computer will also supply stories that mention `` I.B.M. , International Business Machines , or Big Blue , '' Mr. Amram says . </s>
<s> Moreover , Individual Inc. 's computers can weigh the value of an article based on how closely the story matches the subscriber 's interest area . </s>
<s> It compares the position of key words in the story ; words in the headline or first paragraph get a higher value . </s>
<s> And it calculates how often the words appear in the story compared with how often they appear in the entire data base . </s>
<s> The higher the ratio of hits to total words , the higher the presumed value to the reader . </s>
<s> Pinpoint Information Corp. , Chantilly , Va. , a producer of $ 1,800-a-year personalized newsletters about the computer industry that started full operation last month , relies on 12 human readers to code news releases by topic in order to select items for each subscriber . </s>
<s> `` The computers find all the key words they can , but the editors confirm every one . </s>
<s> Computer picking is n't perfect , '' says Harvey Golomb , president and founder of Pinpoint . </s>
<s> The humans also write abstracts of articles from some 200 computer industry publications . </s>
<s> Once all the articles are coded and put in a data base , Pinpoint 's computers pick the most relevant for each subscriber and lay them out in a three-to-five-page newsletter format ; each newsletter is sent directly from the computer to the subscriber 's fax machine . </s>
<s> Mr. Golomb says each of his computers can produce and send about 75 unique newsletters a night . </s>
<s> Many computer network users who never see news wires would like to sort through their electronic mail automatically . </s>
<s> So-called E-mail is the collection of inter-office memos , gossip , technical data , schedules and directives distributed over local and national computer networks . </s>
<s> `` All these interconnected computers make it difficult to sort out what 's junk and what 's important , '' says Chuck Digate , a former Lotus Development executive who has started a new company to cope with the problem . </s>
<s> Mr. Digate says his firm , Beyond Inc. , has licensed technology known as Information Lens from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and plans to develop it for commercial use . </s>
<s> The MIT project devised ways for E-mail to be automatically categorized as top priority if it comes from certain designated senders or requires action in the next couple of days . </s>
<s> Mr. Digate says that Beyond will refine the product `` so the message will be smart enough to know to come back and bother you again next week . '' </s>
<s> And if a user is busy , `` he can set it for crisis mode : ` Do n't bother me with reports until Monday . ' '' </s>
<s> A program called Notes , which is under development by Lotus , also is designed to sort E-mail sent within work groups . </s>
<s> One thing that makes E-mail difficult to sift through is that each item looks the same . </s>
<s> Notes , which is designed for advanced computers that display graphics , allows mail senders to put different logos on their mail . </s>
<s> A daily news briefing from the company librarian , for example , would have a distinctive format on the screen , just as a paper version would have . </s>
<s> `` With E-mail , you do n't have the visual clues of paper , '' says Mr. Tarter , the editor of SoftLetter . </s>
<s> `` With Notes , they 're visually distinct . </s>
