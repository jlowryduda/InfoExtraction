<s> Melvin Belli 's San Francisco law offices may have been the epicenter of legal activity after Tuesday 's earthquake . </s>
<s> In the first 25 minutes after his office 's telephone service was restored yesterday morning , 17 potential clients had called seeking the services of the self-proclaimed King of Torts . </s>
<s> Mr. Belli , like many other personal-injury lawyers , suspects that the earthquake , which measured 6.9 on the Richter scale , will generate enough lawsuits to keep this city 's personal-injury and construction lawyers busy for quite some time . </s>
<s> Suits are likely to be filed against engineering firms , contractors and developers , as well as against local-government agencies . </s>
<s> But lawyers looking to cash in on the quake may have a tough time once their cases reach a judge . </s>
<s> Experts on California tort law say protections afforded government agencies in such cases are pretty ironclad . </s>
<s> Even claims against individuals and companies face significant roadblocks . </s>
<s> The major legal barrier is the principle that no one can be held liable for an `` act of God . '' </s>
<s> For now , says Laurence Drivon , president-elect of the 6,000-member California Trial Lawyers Association , `` the last thing we really need to worry about is whether anybody is going to get sued , or whether they have liability or not . </s>
<s> We still have people wandering around in a daze in San Francisco worrying about whether it 's going to rain tonight . '' </s>
<s> But that wo n't stop plaintiffs ' lawyers from seeking a little room for maneuvering . </s>
<s> In San Francisco , they argue , an earthquake was a near certainty . </s>
<s> Therefore , engineering firms , construction contractors and developers can be sued for not keeping structures up to standard , and government agencies can be held accountable for failing to properly protect citizens from such a foreseeable disaster , if negligence can be proven . </s>
<s> `` My prediction is there will be mass litigation over errors and omissions in engineering and contracting , '' says Stanley Chesley , a well-known Cincinnati plaintiffs lawyer . </s>
<s> From what he saw on television , Mr. Chesley points out that Interstate 880 , which collapsed and killed more than 200 commuters , suffered serious damage while surrounding buildings appeared to sustain no damage whatsoever . </s>
<s> He adds that `` they were aware of the propensity for earthquakes and the San Andreas Fault . '' </s>
<s> The flamboyant and publicity-conscious Mr. Belli says he already has investigators looking into who could be held liable for the damage on the Bay Bridge and the interstate approaching it . </s>
<s> `` We wo n't know until the smoke clears -- but yes , we 're looking into it , '' he says . </s>
<s> Mr. Belli says he wants to know whether state or federal engineers or private companies could have prevented the damage . </s>
<s> Mr. Belli , who was at Candlestick Park for the World Series Tuesday night , says he has hired civil engineers to check out his own mildly damaged building and to investigate the bridge collapse . </s>
<s> Defense lawyers , perhaps understandably , say that plaintiffs ' lawyers taking such an approach will have little success in pursuing their claims , though they add that the facts of each case must be looked at individually . </s>
<s> `` A lot of this is going to be code-related , '' says Ignazio J. Ruvolo , a construction law specialist at Bronson , Bronson & McKinnon , a San Francisco law firm . </s>
<s> Plaintiffs , he says , will argue that damaged structures were n't built to proper design standards . </s>
<s> But if defendants can prove that they met San Francisco 's stringent building codes , `` that 's probably going to protect them , '' Mr. Ruvolo says . </s>
<s> Government entities , continues Mr. Ruvolo , could be protected by the California Government Tort Liability Act . </s>
<s> Under the statute , agencies are provided `` defenses that normally are n't available in the private sector , '' Mr. Ruvolo says . </s>
<s> `` The legislature does not want to inhibit the unique government activities by exposing public entities to liability . '' </s>
<s> Built into the statute are so-called design immunities , which are likely to protect government agencies , according to Mr. Ruvolo and Richard Covert , a lawyer with the California Department of Transportation , which oversees the damaged Bay Bridge . </s>
<s> The state is protected when plans and designs for public structures were approved ahead of time or when structures met previously approved standards , says Mr. Covert . </s>
<s> He believes those defenses might well apply to the Bay Bridge collapse . </s>
<s> Nevertheless , he adds , `` I would n't get totally shocked if we get lawsuits out of the Bay Bridge . '' </s>
<s> If there 's going to be a race to the courthouse , it has n't started yet . </s>
<s> Mr. Covert had to search through law books scattered on the floor of his office yesterday , and Mr. Belli 's courtyard was strewn with bricks . </s>
<s> Wednesday , Mr. Belli 's staff was n't permitted into his office by city officials worried about their safety . </s>
<s> He said he set up shop on the sidewalk in front of his town-house office and helped victims apply for federal aid -- free of charge . </s>
<s> In a news release issued by Mr. Drivon , the trial lawyers association also promised free assistance to victims . </s>
<s> The association said it would monitor the conduct of lawyers and warned that solicitation of business is unethical . </s>
