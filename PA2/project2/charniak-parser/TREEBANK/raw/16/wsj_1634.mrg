<s> When Walter Yetnikoff , the president of Sony Corp. 's CBS Records , last month told producer Peter Guber that Sony was about to make a $ 3.4 billion bid for Columbia Pictures and needed someone to run the studio , Mr. Guber jumped at the chance . </s>
<s> Within two days , he was on his way to New York and Tokyo to meet with top brass at Sony . </s>
<s> And before the week was out , Sony had offered Mr. Guber and his partner , Jon Peters , the most lucrative employment contracts in the history of the movie business . </s>
<s> Not only that , Sony also agreed to give them a stake in Columbia 's future profits and buy their company , Guber Peters Entertainment Co. , for $ 200 million , almost 40 % more than the market value of the company . </s>
<s> There was just one sticking point : The two had a prior commitment . </s>
<s> Just seven months earlier , they had signed a five-year exclusive contract to make movies for Warner Bros. for which they had just produced the smash hit `` Batman . '' </s>
<s> But Mr. Guber figured that Warner Communications Inc. chairman Steven Ross , would empathize and let the producers go , knowing the Sony offer was `` the culmination of a life 's work . '' </s>
<s> He figured wrong . </s>
<s> Last week , following fruitless settlement talks , Warner , now merging with Time Inc. , filed a $ 1 billion breach of contract suit in Los Angeles Superior Court against both Sony and Guber Peters . </s>
<s> Sony promptly countersued , charging Warner with trying to sabotage its acquisitions and hurt its efforts to enter the U.S. movie business . </s>
<s> The accusations of lying and duplicity are flying thick and fast on both sides : As one Sony executive puts it , `` It 's World War III . '' </s>
<s> That two successful producers who are n't all that well known outside Hollywood could occasion such a clash of corporate titans suggests how desperate the quest for proven talent is in the movie business . </s>
<s> And they are a very odd team in any case . </s>
<s> Mr. Guber was raised in Boston and educated in New York . </s>
<s> He is a lawyer with a string of academic degrees . </s>
<s> Mr. Peters is a high-school dropout who came to fame as Barbra Streisand 's hairdresser . </s>
<s> Yet , they are far and away the most prolific producers in Hollywood . </s>
<s> And despite their share of duds , they make movies that make money . </s>
<s> That is a skill Sony badly needs -- and Warner is loath to lose . </s>
<s> Although Columbia had a good summer with `` Ghostbusters II '' and `` When Harry Met Sally , '' rivals such as Warner , Paramount Pictures , Walt Disney Co. and Universal Studios have been thrashing Columbia at the box office . </s>
<s> After five years of management turmoil , with four different studio heads , Columbia sorely needs a stable , savvy team to restore its credibility and get it back in the business of making hits . </s>
<s> Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters are n't universally loved in Hollywood but they are well connected . </s>
<s> Their stock in trade as `` executive producers '' is sniffing out hot properties , locking them up and then getting big studios to bankroll and distribute them . </s>
<s> Sometimes Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters do little more than grab the first draft of a screenplay for a `` Flashdance , '' or buy rights to a best seller such as `` The Color Purple . '' </s>
<s> It falls to others to do the writing , directing and producing . </s>
<s> With MGM\/UA 's `` Rainman , '' for instance , Messrs. Guber and Peters had virtually nothing to do with day-to-day production , but their names still appear in big letters on the credits , and they are inevitably associated with its success . </s>
<s> Sometimes , as with `` Batman , '' the pair really do make the film . </s>
<s> In that case , Guber Peters acquired the rights in 1979 , nursed the movie through a dozen scripts , and were on the set in London for 11 months hovering over the most minute changes in casting and production . </s>
<s> `` They 're the best production talent around , '' says Brian De Palma , beholden to Guber Peters for hiring him to direct the Warner movie of Tom Wolfe 's novel `` Bonfire of the Vanities . '' </s>
<s> On that film , which is to start shooting in a few months , `` they 've been very much involved , hiring talent and discussing the development of the script . </s>
<s> And when you 're making a movie this big , you need all the help you can get , '' Mr. De Palma adds . </s>
<s> `` I wish they were around 24 hours a day . '' </s>
<s> And some movies seem to have been hurt by their inattention . </s>
<s> Warner executives blame Mr. Guber 's and Mr. Peters 's lack of involvement in `` Caddyshack II '' for casting and production problems and the film 's ultimate dismal failure . </s>
<s> `` We 've had a few bombs , '' admits Mr. Peters . </s>
<s> `` But by and large this company has only been profitable . '' </s>
<s> He says his company 's prowess at packaging and marketing `` is why we 'll be good at Columbia . </s>
<s> We practically ran our own studio . '' </s>
<s> Longtime Hollywood associates describe Mr. Guber as the intellectual powerhouse of the two , a man with a flair for deal-making and marketing . </s>
<s> `` Peter is a major piece of Hollywood manpower who has really earned his success , '' says Robert Bookman , an agent at Creative Artists Agency . </s>
<s> Mark Johnson , the producer of `` Rainman , '' chimes in : `` He has a great ability to hire terrific people and delegate authority ... . </s>
<s> It 's no accident that they 've been able to develop such successful material . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Peters , on the other hand , has fewer fans in Hollywood , and his detractors like to characterize him as something of a hot-tempered bully . </s>
<s> He gets better reviews as a creative whiz , an enthusiast , an idea man . </s>
<s> He also had to fight harder for credibility than his partner did . </s>
<s> Barbra Streisand made him famous . </s>
<s> He cut her hair . </s>
<s> He lived with her . </s>
<s> He came to produce her records and her movies -- `` A Star Is Born '' and `` The Main Event . '' </s>
<s> Thrice married but now single , Mr. Peters got plenty of ink last summer for an on-set romance with actress Kim Basinger during the making of `` Batman . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Guber , by contrast , has been married to one woman for more than 20 years . </s>
<s> But for all their intellectual and stylistic differences , they make the perfect `` good cop , bad cop '' team , Hollywood associates say . </s>
<s> `` Peter is the bright , sympathetic guy when you 're doing a deal , '' says one agent . </s>
<s> `` If there 's a problem , Peter disappears , and all of a sudden Jon shows up . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters rub many people in Hollywood the wrong way . </s>
<s> Producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer , who shepherded `` Flashdance '' through several scripts and ultimately produced the movie , bristle when Messrs. Guber and Peters take credit for the film . </s>
<s> Says Mr. Simpson : `` The script was unreadable . </s>
<s> We reinvented it . </s>
<s> We are the producers of that movie . </s>
<s> They got a small piece of the net profits and a screen credit '' as executive producers . </s>
<s> When Roger Birnbaum , an executive who worked for Guber Peters in the early 1980s , left to take a job as head of production at the United Artists studio , they made him forfeit all credits and financial interest in the films he had helped develop , including `` Rainman '' and `` Batman . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Peters acknowledges that and says it 's not unlike the situation he and Mr. Guber are in with Warner . </s>
<s> `` I was upset with Roger , I fumpered and schmumpered , '' says Mr. Peters . </s>
<s> `` But he wanted to pursue his own dream , and he went . '' </s>
<s> Still , Mr. Birnbaum says his relationship with Guber Peters was `` one of the most successful I 've had in Hollywood . '' </s>
<s> The two `` have a wonderful chemistry -- Jon is very impulsive , and Peter is very compulsive , '' adds Mr. Birnbaum , who is now head of production at News Corp. 's 20th Century Fox Film Co . </s>
<s> `` Jon Peters will come barreling into a room , say he 's got a great idea , and be gone . </s>
<s> Peter will take the kernel of that idea and make it grow into something specific ... . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Birnbaum recalls that Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters shifted into high gear a few years back upon learning that they had competition for the story of the murdered naturalist Dian Fossey , which became `` Gorillas in the Mist . '' </s>
<s> He says , `` Within a few weeks , we made deals with the government of Rwanda and everyone who had ever met or talked to Dian Fossey . </s>
<s> I think Peter even made some deals with the gorillas . '' </s>
<s> Universal Studios was working on a competing film , but the studio and its producers ultimately agreed to co-produce the film with Guber Peters and Warner . </s>
<s> More recently , Guber Peters beat out a dozen other producers , reportedly including Robert Redford and Ted Turner , for rights to the life story of Chico Mendes , the murdered Brazilian union leader who fought developers in the Amazon rain forest . </s>
<s> Messrs. Guber and Peters assiduously courted the man 's widow for months , showing her a tape of `` Gorillas in the Mist '' to impress her with the quality of their work . </s>
<s> Money helped , too . </s>
<s> Ultimately , they paid more than $ 1 million for the rights . </s>
<s> -LRB- The sale caused a rift between the widow and some of her husband 's followers . </s>
<s> Some of the money will go to the Chico Mendes Foundation , but it is n't earmarked for groups trying to save the rain forest . -RRB- </s>
<s> It 's hardly astonishing -LRB- given the men 's track record -RRB- that Sony wants Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters . </s>
<s> But it is puzzling to some Hollywood executives that Sony rushed to hire them without clearing up the Warner situation first . </s>
<s> Some note that Sony might have saved itself some trouble by just hiring Mr. Guber and letting Mr. Peters stay on to fulfill the Warner contract . </s>
<s> But though `` people in town may ask why Guber needs Peters , it 's good to have a partner , and obviously the chemistry works , '' says Steven Tisch , a producer who once worked for Mr. Guber . </s>
<s> `` This business is n't about personalities at the end of the day -- it s about whether the ink is red or black . </s>
<s> In the case of Peter and Jon , the ink has been very , very black . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Guber got his start in the movie business at Columbia two decades ago . </s>
<s> Recruited from New York University 's MBA program , he rose within two years to head of production , overseeing such films as `` The Way We Were , '' `` Taxi Driver , '' `` Tommy '' and `` Shampoo . '' </s>
<s> In 1976 , he teamed up with record producer Neil Bogart in Casablanca Records and Filmworks -- later called Polygram Pictures -- where they produced such hits as as `` The Deep , '' and `` Midnight Express . '' </s>
<s> In 1980 , Mr. Guber got together with Mr. Peters , by then a successful producer in his own right , after the death of Mr. Bogart . </s>
<s> While Guber Peters produced a number of hits for Warner and others , their record was n't always so impressive . </s>
<s> Among their clinkers were `` The Legend of Billie Jean , '' `` VisionQuest , '' `` Clue '' and `` Clan of the Cave Bear . '' </s>
<s> And the failures make it possible for Warner in its current lawsuit to paint the producers as ingrates . </s>
<s> The studio says it stuck with them `` even in the early years when the creative partnership was not particularly profitable for Warner . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Guber replies that `` this is a Goliath , this Time Warner , trying to chew up two fellows who have done only well for them for a long period of time . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters maintain that executives at Warner have always known of their ambitions to run a major entertainment powerhouse , but that Warner never felt threatened until they linked up with Sony . </s>
<s> `` From the beginning , -LCB- they -RCB- knew we had a goal and a dream , '' says Mr. Guber . </s>
<s> On a number of occasions , he adds , he tried to get Warner to buy Guber Peters outright . </s>
<s> `` They always listened , but they never acted , '' Mr. Guber says . </s>
<s> In 1987 , Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters contributed their company 's assets in exchange for a 28 % stake in Barris Entertainment , a small-fry TV production company controlled by Giant Industries Inc. Chairman Burt Sugarman . </s>
<s> In July a year later , Warner agreed to release the producers from their old contract when Messrs. Guber , Peters and Sugarman made a $ 100 million offer to buy 25 % of MGM\/UA . </s>
<s> Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters planned to run the nearly dormant MGM studio , and the two even tried to interest Warner Bros . ' President Terry Semel in becoming a partner after he advised them on the deal . </s>
<s> But the MGM plan collapsed just two weeks later . </s>
<s> Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters say they got a look at the books and balked at the price . </s>
<s> Their relationship with Mr. Sugarman soured shortly thereafter . </s>
<s> Last May , he sold his 24 % stake in Barris to a passive Australian investor and Barris was renamed Guber Peters Entertainment Co . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters had agreed to extend their Warner agreement with the new five-year exclusive contract . </s>
<s> The new deal was considered the most generous of its kind , both financially and in terms of creative freedom . </s>
<s> But it paled by comparison to what Sony was to offer last month : the chance , at last , to run a major studio , about $ 50 million in deferred compensation , up to 10 % of Columbia 's future cash flow , 8 % of the future appreciation of Columbia 's market value , and annual salaries of $ 2.7 million for each . </s>
<s> The producers ' 28 % share of publicly held Guber Peters would net them an additional $ 50 million . </s>
<s> Sony also agreed to indemnify the producers against any liability to Warner . </s>
<s> Sony is paying a hefty price for a company that had revenue of only $ 42 million last year . </s>
<s> And earnings have been erratic . </s>
<s> In the the latest quarter , thanks in part to `` Batman , '' Guber Peters earned $ 5.8 million , or 50 cents a share , compared to a loss of $ 6.8 million , or 62 cents a share , in last year 's quarter . </s>
<s> Guber Peters stock , which traded as low as $ 6 a share last year , closed yesterday at $ 16.625 . </s>
<s> The two sides now are accusing each other of lying . </s>
<s> Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters claim they have an oral agreement with Warner executives that allows them to terminate their contract should the opportunity to run a major studio arise . </s>
<s> But in affidavits filed yesterday in the Los Angeles court , Mr. Ross , Warner Bros. Chairman Robert Daly and President Semel deny that such an oral agreement was ever made . </s>
<s> Warner , in its court filings , calls it `` a piece of fiction created for this litigation . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Daly in his affidavit acknowledges that Warner agreed to release the producers last year to take over MGM but says that situation was altogether different . </s>
<s> For one thing , according to Mr. Daly , the producers requested a release in advance . </s>
<s> Moreover , the old contract was about to expire , and the lineup of Guber Peters pictures for Warner was n't as strong as it is now . </s>
<s> Warner itself was in negotiations with MGM over certain movie and other rights , and it was `` in Warner 's interest to accommodate MGM\/UA , Guber and Peters by permitting them to become MGM executives , '' Mr. Daly said in his affidavit . </s>
<s> Warner obviously does n't think that it is in its own interests to let Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters go off to Columbia . </s>
<s> At the very least , Mr. Ross clearly sees an opportunity to use the two men to get a pound of flesh from Sony . </s>
<s> During settlement talks , for example , Warner demanded such things as cable TV rights to Columbia movies and Columbia 's interest in the studio it jointly owns with Warner , according to executives involved in the talks . </s>
<s> In any settlement , Warner is almost certain to demand rights to most of the 50 or so projects Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters have locked up for the next few years , notably sequels to `` Batman . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters refuse to concede that they may have made a tactical error in accepting the Sony offer before taking it up with Warner . </s>
<s> And they say there are plenty of precedents in Hollywood for letting people out of contracts . </s>
<s> The last time Columbia Pictures was looking for a studio chief , they note , Warner released producer David Puttnam from his contract , then took him back after he was subsequently fired by his bosses at Columbia . </s>
<s> In his affidavit filed yesterday , Warner 's Mr. Ross indicated he is n't buying any such argument : `` If Sony succeeds here , no written contract in Hollywood will be worth the paper it 's written on . </s>
