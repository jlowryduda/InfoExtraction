<s> New York Times Co. 's third-quarter earnings report is reinforcing analysts ' belief that newspaper publishers will be facing continued poor earnings comparisons through 1990 . </s>
<s> The publisher was able to register soaring quarter net income because of a onetime gain on the sale of its cable-TV system . </s>
<s> However , operating profit fell 35 % to $ 16.4 million . </s>
<s> The decline reflected the expense of buying three magazines , lower earnings from the forest-products group , and what is proving to be a nagging major problem , continued declines in advertising linage at the New York Times , the company 's flagship daily newspaper . </s>
<s> In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange , New York Times closed at $ 28.125 a share , down 37.5 cents . </s>
<s> Analysts said the company 's troubles mirror those of the industry . </s>
<s> Retail advertising , which often represents half of the advertising volume at most daily newspapers , largely is n't rebounding in the second half from extended doldrums as expected . </s>
<s> At the same time , newspapers are bedeviled by lagging national advertising , especially in its financial component . </s>
<s> Dow Jones & Co. recently reported net fell 9.9 % , a reflection , in part , of continued softness in financial advertising at The Wall Street Journal and Barron 's magazine . </s>
<s> `` We expect next year to be a fairly soft year in newspaper-industry advertising , '' said John Morton , an analyst for Lynch , Jones & Ryan . </s>
<s> `` Next year , earnings will hold steady , but we just do n't see a big turnaround in the trend in advertising . '' </s>
<s> John S. Reidy , an analyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , said , `` The Times faces the same problem of other publishers : linage is down . </s>
<s> It will be hard to do handstands until real linage starts heading back up . '' </s>
<s> In the quarterly report , Arthur Ochs Sulzberger , New York Times Co. chairman and chief executive officer , said negative factors affecting third-quarter earnings will continue . </s>
<s> Analysts agreed with company expectations that operating profit will be down this year and in 1990 . </s>
<s> Mr. Sulzberger said the scheduled opening of a new color-printing plant in Edison , N.J. , in 1990 would involve heavy startup and depreciation costs . </s>
<s> `` With the Edison plant coming on line next summer , the Times is facing some tough earnings comparison in the future , '' said Peter Appert , an analyst with C.J. Lawrence , Morgan Grenfell . </s>
<s> `` But many newspapers are facing similar comparisons . '' </s>
<s> The sale of the company 's cable franchise brought an after-tax gain of $ 193.3 million , part of which will be used to reduce debt . </s>
<s> The company also has a stock-repurchase plan . </s>
<s> Analysts said they were impressed by the performance of the company 's newspaper group , which consists of the Times , 35 regional newspapers and a one-third interest in the International Herald Tribune ; group operating profit for the quarter increased slightly to $ 34.9 million from $ 34.5 million on flat revenue . </s>
<s> Drexel Burnham 's Mr. Reidy pointed out that `` profits held up in a tough revenue environment . </s>
<s> That 's a good sign when profits are stable during a time revenue is in the trough . </s>
