<s> Senate Democrats favoring a cut in the capital-gains tax have decided , under pressure from their leaders , not to offer their own proposal , placing another obstacle in the path of President Bush 's legislative priority . </s>
<s> A core group of six or so Democratic senators has been working behind the scenes to develop a proposal to reduce the tax on the gain from the sale of assets . </s>
<s> The plan was complete except for finishing touches , and there was talk that it would be unveiled as early as yesterday . </s>
<s> But Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell -LRB- D. , Maine -RRB- , a vigorous opponent of the capital-gains tax cut , called the group to meet with him Wednesday night and again yesterday . </s>
<s> Sen. Mitchell urged them to desist . </s>
<s> Afterward , leaders of the dissident Democrats relented , and said they would n't offer their own proposal as they had planned . </s>
<s> The decision is a setback for President Bush , who needs the support of Democrats to pass the tax cut through the Democratic-controlled Senate . </s>
<s> Having a proposal sponsored by Democrats would have given the president an advantage . </s>
<s> Having only a Republican measure makes the task harder . </s>
<s> Still , Sen. Bob Packwood -LRB- R. , Ore. -RRB- , the lead sponsor of the Republican capital-gains amendment , predicted that the tax cut would be enacted this year . </s>
<s> He said a clear majority of senators back the tax reduction and that ultimately there would be enough senators to overcome any procedural hurdle the Democratic leadership might erect . </s>
<s> But Sen. Mitchell , buoyed by his victory among fellow Democrats , strongly disagreed . </s>
<s> Mr. Mitchell has been predicting that the president 's initiative would fail this year . </s>
<s> Yesterday , in an interview , he added that the Democrats ' decision `` increases the likelihood that a capital-gains tax cut will not pass this year . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Mitchell 's first victory came last week , when the Senate passed a deficit-reduction bill that did n't contain a capital-gains provision . </s>
<s> That vote made it unlikely that a capital-gains tax cut would be included in the final bill , now being drafted by House and Senate negotiators . </s>
<s> The House version of the bill does include the tax cut . </s>
<s> Now Republican leaders are concentrating on attaching a capital-gains amendment to some other bill , perhaps a measure raising the federal borrowing limit or a second tax bill that would follow on the heels of the deficit-reduction legislation . </s>
<s> To help lay the groundwork for that fight , President Bush plans early next week to meet at the White House with some 20 Democratic senators who favor cutting the capital-gains tax or are undecided on the issue . </s>
<s> The president apparently will have only one bill to push , Sen. Packwood 's , and at least some of the dissident Democrats plan to support it . </s>
<s> `` I may want to offer additional amendments to improve it when the bill comes to the floor , '' said Sen. David Boren -LRB- D. , Okla. -RRB- , a leader of those Democrats . </s>
<s> The Packwood plan , as expected , would allow individuals to exclude from income 5 % of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more than one year . </s>
<s> The exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year the asset was held , until it reached a maximum of 35 % after seven years . </s>
<s> The exclusion would apply to assets sold after Oct. 1 . </s>
<s> As an alternative , taxpayers could chose to reduce their gains by an inflation index . </s>
<s> For corporations , the top tax rate on the sale of assets held for more than three years would be cut to 33 % from the current top rate of 34 % . </s>
<s> That rate would gradually decline to as little as 29 % for corporate assets held for 15 years . </s>
<s> The Packwood plan also would include a proposal , designed by Sen. William Roth -LRB- R. , Del. -RRB- , that would create new tax benefits for individual retirement accounts . </s>
<s> The Roth plan would create a new , non-deductible IRA from which money could be withdrawn tax-free not only for retirement , but also for the purchase of a first home , education expenses and medical expenses . </s>
<s> Current IRAs could be rolled over into the new IRAs , but would be subject to tax though no penalty . </s>
