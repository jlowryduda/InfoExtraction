<s> THE SALES PITCH could n't sound better . </s>
<s> First , there 's the name : `` asset-backed securities . '' </s>
<s> Better than all those offers you get to buy securities backed by nothing . </s>
<s> And there 's more . </s>
<s> The assets backing the securities come from some of the country 's biggest -- and most secure -- institutions . </s>
<s> Most earn high ratings from credit agencies . </s>
<s> Their yields are higher than those of U.S. Treasury issues . </s>
<s> And the booming market has already attracted many of the nation 's biggest institutional investors . </s>
<s> Ready to jump ? </s>
<s> Well , think twice . </s>
<s> The concept may be simple : Take a bunch of loans , tie them up in one neat package , and sell pieces of the package to investors . </s>
<s> But the simplicity may be misleading . </s>
<s> Skeptics say the slightly higher returns are n't enough to compensate for the extra risk . </s>
<s> They warn that asset-backed securities are only as good as the assets and credit backing that support them -- and those are hard to evaluate . </s>
<s> Moreover , the securities were introduced only about 4 1\/2 years ago ; the biggest unknown is how they will fare in a recession . </s>
<s> `` A lot of this stuff really is in untested waters , '' says Owen Carney , director of the investment securities division of the U.S. comptroller of the currency . </s>
<s> `` We do n't know how this whole market will work in a serious economic downturn . '' </s>
<s> Such concerns , however , have n't stopped asset-backed securities from becoming one of Wall Street 's hottest new products . </s>
<s> Since the spring of 1985 , financial alchemists have transformed a wide variety of debt into these new securities . </s>
<s> They have sold issues backed by car loans , boat loans and recreational-vehicle loans . </s>
<s> They have offered bundles of homeequity loans , as well as packages of loans used to buy vacation time-shares . </s>
<s> Last year , there was an issue of `` death-backed bonds '' -- securities backed by loans to life-insurance policyholders . </s>
<s> Some predict there will be `` Third World bonds , '' backed by loans to Brazil , Argentina and other debt-ridden nations . </s>
<s> And the biggest volume this year has been on securities backed by credit-card receivables , sometimes known as `` plastic bonds . '' </s>
<s> `` This is the heyday of debt , '' says James Grant , editor of Grant 's Interest Rate Observer , a newsletter . </s>
<s> `` Before the sun sets on the '80s , it seems nothing will be left unhocked . '' </s>
<s> The result is a $ 45 billion market , according to Securities Data Co . </s>
<s> That includes more than $ 9.5 billion issued through August of this year , up sharply from $ 6.5 billion in the comparable 1988 period -- and more than in all of 1987 . </s>
<s> Most issues have been sold to professional money managers , pension funds , bank trust departments and other institutions . </s>
<s> But wealthy individuals also have been jumping in , and lately brokers have been pushing smaller investors into the asset-backed market . </s>
<s> The entry fee is affordable : Issues typically are sold in minimum denominations of $ 1,000 . </s>
<s> `` We expect additional offerings '' of asset-backed securities targeted toward individual investors , says Bill Addiss , a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc . </s>
<s> The process typically begins when an institution , such as Citibank or Sears , Roebuck & Co. , takes a pool of credit-card or other receivables and sells them to a specially created trust . </s>
<s> The trust then issues securities -- generally due in five years or less -- that are underwritten by Wall Street brokerage firms and offered to investors . </s>
<s> Issues typically come with `` credit enhancements , '' such as a bank letter of credit , and thus have received high credit ratings . </s>
<s> Enthusiasts say the booming market has opened up a valuable new source of funds to issuers , while providing a valuable new investment for individuals and institutions . </s>
<s> Asset-backed securities `` are an attractive investment compared to bank certificates of deposit or other corporate bonds , '' says Craig J. Goldberg , managing director and head of the asset-backed securities group at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets . </s>
<s> But skeptics question whether asset-backed bonds offer sufficient rewards to compensate for the extra risks . </s>
<s> Consider a $ 500 million offering of 9 % securities issued last spring and backed by Citibank credit-card receivables . </s>
<s> The triple-A-rated issue offered a yield of only about 0.5 percentage point above four-year Treasury issues . </s>
<s> On a $ 10,000 investment , that 's a difference of only $ 50 a year . </s>
<s> That kind of spread can be critical for money managers who buy bonds in large quantities and whose livelihood depends on outperforming the money manager across the street . </s>
<s> But for individuals who buy much smaller amounts and care less about relative performance than in preserving what they have , that margin is meaningless . </s>
<s> `` If you 're in the bond business playing the relative-performance derby , then even an extra 25 basis points -LRB- 0.25 percentage point -RRB- becomes an important consideration on a career basis , '' says Mr. Grant . </s>
<s> `` But if you 're an individual investing money and trying to get it back again , then that is n't of overwhelming importance . '' </s>
<s> Moreover , the interest on asset-backed securities is fully taxable , while interest on Treasury issues is tax-free at the state and local level . </s>
<s> That 's why some investment managers , such as Alex Powers , a vice president of Chase Manhattan Bank 's private banking division , do n't recommend most asset-backed issues for individuals in high-tax states , such as New York or California . </s>
<s> But Mr. Powers has purchased asset-backed issues for individuals with tax-deferred accounts , such as retirement plans . </s>
<s> He points out that institutions buying asset-backed issues in large quantities can earn higher spreads over Treasurys than individuals buying smaller amounts . </s>
<s> Another concern is liquidity , or how easily a security can be converted into cash . </s>
<s> The secondary , or resale , market for asset-backed securities is relatively new and much less active than for Treasury issues . </s>
<s> That could make it tricky for investors who need to sell their holdings quickly before the securities mature . </s>
<s> That 's particularly true , analysts say , for certain of the securities , such as those backed by time-share loans . </s>
<s> `` You could see massive gyrations here because it 's such a thinly traded market , '' says Jonathan S. Paris , a vice president of European Investors Inc. , a New York investment-management firm . </s>
<s> In addition , an investor who wants to know the daily value of Treasury bonds , or corporate bonds traded on the New York Stock Exchange , can simply check newspaper listings . </s>
<s> There are n't any such listings for asset-backed securities . </s>
<s> Evaluating asset-backed securities poses another problem . </s>
<s> Investors , for instance , may mistakenly assume that the bank or company that originally held the assets is guaranteeing the securities . </s>
<s> It is n't . </s>
<s> The front cover of the prospectus for the Citibank credit-card receivables offering points out in bold capital letters that the certificates represent an interest only in the specially created trust and `` do not represent interests in or obligations of the banks , Citibank N.A. , Citicorp or any affiliate thereof . '' </s>
<s> In other words , if there 's a problem , do n't expect Citibank to come to the rescue . </s>
<s> The prospectus also notes that the securities are not guaranteed by any government agency . </s>
<s> That means investors have to focus on the quality of the debt that lies beneath the securities , as well as on the credit enhancement for the issue and the credit ratings the issue has received . </s>
<s> That also is n't easy . </s>
<s> Take the `` credit enhancements , '' which typically include a bank letter of credit or insurance from a bond-insurance company . </s>
<s> The letter of credit typically is not offered by the bank selling the assets to back the securities . </s>
<s> Nor does it cover the entire portfolio . </s>
<s> Details of credit enhancements vary widely from issue to issue . </s>
<s> Still , they play a crucial role in winning top ratings for most asset-backed issues -- which in turn is why the yield above Treasurys is so slim . </s>
<s> But skeptics ask why you should bother buying this stuff when you can get only slightly lower yields on government-guaranteed paper . </s>
<s> When you buy an asset-backed issue , you take the risk that a bank or an insurer could run into unexpected difficulties . </s>
<s> If a bank 's credit rating was lowered because of , say , its loans to Third World nations , that could also affect the ratings , liquidity and prices of the asset-backed issues that the bank supports . </s>
<s> Underwriters insist these issues are constructed to withstand extremely tough economic conditions . </s>
<s> But despite the credit enhancements , despite the high ratings , some money managers still worry that a recession could wreak havoc on the underlying assets . </s>
<s> At a time when Americans are leveraged to their eyeballs , asset-backed investors may be taking a heady gamble that consumers will be able to repay loans in hard times . </s>
<s> At the very least , a recession would prompt investors to buy the highest-quality bonds they can find -- that is , Treasurys . </s>
<s> That could widen the yield spread between Treasurys and asset-backed securities , as well as make it tougher to unload the latter . </s>
<s> But it could be much worse . </s>
<s> Some analysts are especially wary of credit-card issues . </s>
<s> For one thing , credit-card loans are unsecured . </s>
<s> In addition , they fear that banks have been overeager to issue cards to the public -- giving cards to too many big spenders who will default during a recession . </s>
<s> `` A day of reckoning is coming where we think the market will place a high premium on the highest-quality debt issues , and therefore we think the best debt investment is U.S. government bonds , '' says Craig Corcoran of Davis\/Zweig Futures Inc. , an investment advisory firm . </s>
<s> What about triple-A-rated asset-backed issues ? </s>
<s> `` Nope , we still say to stick with Treasurys , '' Mr. Corcoran replies . </s>
<s> Ratings , he notes , `` are subject to change . '' </s>
<s> All this makes asset-backed securities seem too risky for many people . </s>
<s> And it reminds Raymond F. DeVoe Jr. , a market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc. , of what he calls `` DeVoe 's Unprovable but Highly Probable Theory No. 1 : </s>
<s> `` More money has been lost reaching for yield than in all the stock speculations , scams and frauds of all time . '' </s>
