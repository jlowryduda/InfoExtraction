<s> Democracy can be cruel to politicians : Sometimes it forces them to make choices . </s>
<s> Now that the Supreme Court opened the door on the subject of abortion , politicians are squinting under the glare of democratic choice . </s>
<s> Their discomfort is a healthy sign for the rest of us . </s>
<s> Republicans are squinting most painfully , at least at first , which is only fair because they 've been shielded the most . </s>
<s> So long as abortion was a question for litigation , not legislation , Republicans could find political security in absolutism . </s>
<s> They could attract one-issue voters by adopting the right-to-life movement 's strongest position , even as pro-choice Republicans knew this mattered little on an issue monopolized by the court . </s>
<s> Now it matters . </s>
<s> Much of Washington thought it detected George Bush in a characteristic waffle on abortion the past week . </s>
<s> Only a month ago he 'd warned Congress not to pass legislation to pay for abortions in cases of rape or incest . </s>
<s> Last Friday , after Congress passed it anyway , he hinted he was looking for compromise . </s>
<s> Was the man who once was pro-choice , but later pro-life , converting again ? </s>
<s> In fact , Mr. Bush 's dance was more wiggle than waffle . </s>
<s> Pro-life advocates say the White House never wavered over the veto . </s>
<s> Christopher Smith -LRB- R. , N.J. -RRB- , a pro-life leader in the House , suggested a compromise that would have adapted restrictive language from rape and incest exceptions in the states . </s>
<s> The White House , never eager for a fight , was happy to try , which is why George Bush said he was looking for `` flexibility '' last week . </s>
<s> When Democrats refused to budge , pro-life Republicans met at the White House with Chief of Staff John Sununu on Monday , and Mr. Bush quickly signaled a veto . </s>
<s> Amid charges of `` timidity '' on Panama and elsewhere , the president was n't about to offend his most energetic constituency . </s>
<s> The GOP doubters were in Congress . </s>
<s> In last week 's House vote , 41 Republicans defected . </s>
<s> After the vote , Connecticut Rep. Nancy Johnson rounded up nearly as many signatures on a letter to Mr. Bush urging him not to veto . </s>
<s> Even such a pro-life stalwart as Sen. Orrin Hatch -LRB- R. , Utah -RRB- had counseled some kind of compromise . </s>
<s> The Senate passed the same bill yesterday , with a veto-proof majority of 67 . </s>
<s> The manuevering illustrates an emerging Republican donnybrook , pacified since the early 1980s . </s>
<s> At the 1988 GOP convention , abortion was barely discussed at all , though delegates were evenly divided on the question of an anti-abortion constitutional amendment . </s>
<s> Ms. Johnson made a passionate statement to the platform committee , but she was talking to herself . </s>
<s> Now many Republicans are listening . </s>
<s> They 're frightened by what they see in New Jersey , and especially Virginia , where pro-life GOP candidates for governor are being pummeled on abortion . </s>
<s> Eddie Mahe , a Republican consultant , says the two GOP candidates could have avoided trouble if they had framed the issue first . </s>
<s> -LRB- In Virginia , Marshall Coleman and his running mate , Eddy Dalton , are both on the defensive for opposing abortions even in cases of rape or incest . -RRB- </s>
<s> But Mr. Mahe adds , `` The net loser in the next few years is the right-to-life side . '' </s>
<s> Darla St. Martin , of the National Right to Life Committee , says exit polls from the 1988 election had single-issue , pro-life voters giving Mr. Bush about five more percentage points of support than pro-choice voters gave Michael Dukakis . </s>
<s> But the Supreme Court 's opening of debate may have changed even that . </s>
<s> GOP pollster Neil Newhouse , of the Wirthlin Group , says polls this summer showed that the single-issue voters had about evened out . </s>
<s> Polls are no substitute for principle , but they 'll do for some politicians . </s>
<s> The Republican danger is that abortion could become for them what it 's long been for Democrats , a divisive litmus test . </s>
<s> It 's already that in the Bush administration , at least for any job in which abortion is even remotely an issue . </s>
<s> Oklahoma official Robert Fulton lost a chance for a senior job in the Department of Health and Human Services after right-to-life activists opposed him . </s>
<s> Caldwell Butler , a conservative former congressman , was barred from a Legal Services post , after he gave wrong answers on abortion . </s>
<s> Even the president 's doctor , Burton Lee , has said on the record that he 'd love to be surgeon general but could n't pass the pro-life test . </s>
<s> In the case of HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan , the litmus test could yet damage issues important to other parts of the Republican coalition . </s>
<s> After Mr. Sullivan waffled on abortion last year , the White House appeased right-to-lifers by surrounding him with pro-life deputies . </s>
<s> Their views on health care and welfare did n't much matter , though HHS spends billions a year on both . </s>
<s> It makes only a handful of abortion-related decisions . </s>
<s> Though Democrats can gloat at all this for now , they may want to contain their glee . </s>
<s> On abortion , their own day will come . </s>
<s> Eventually even Republicans will find a way to frame the issue in ways that expose pro-choice absolutism . </s>
<s> Does the candidate favor parental consent for teen-age abortions ? </s>
<s> -LRB- The pro-choice lobby does n't . </s>
<s> -RRB- What about banning abortions in the second and third trimesters ? </s>
<s> -LRB- The lobby says no again . -RRB- </s>
<s> Democracy is forcing the abortion debate toward healthy compromise , toward the unpolarizing middle . </s>
<s> Roe v. Wade pre-empted political debate , so the extremes blossomed . </s>
<s> Now the ambivalent middle , a moral majority of sorts , is reasserting itself . </s>
<s> Within a few years , the outcome in most states is likely to be that abortion will be more restricted , but not completely banned . </s>
<s> This is where the voters are , which is where politicians usually end up . </s>
