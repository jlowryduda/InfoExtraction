<s> Exxon Corp. said it will move its headquarters from Manhattan to Dallas . </s>
<s> Most of the 300 employees at the oil company 's midtown headquarters building -- including much of senior management -- were unaware of the plan until informed at a morning meeting by Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl . </s>
<s> The shift wo n't affect operations . </s>
<s> As part of its restructuring several years ago , Exxon moved most of those out of the city and sold its 53-floor Rockefeller Center skyscraper to a Japanese company . </s>
<s> But the pullout is an embarrassment to New York City officials , coming at a time of high office building vacancy rates and departures by other major companies . </s>
<s> Mobil Corp. is in the process of vacating its headquarters here , and huge operations like J.C. Penney & Co. and Trans World Airlines have recently left . </s>
<s> New York authorities , informed yesterday about the move , reacted with concern and even some anger to the idea of the nation 's third-largest corporation leaving without giving them an opportunity to accommodate it . </s>
<s> `` We are dismayed , but there 's nothing we can do about it now , '' said Stanley Grayson , New York City deputy mayor for finance and economic development . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , Dallas welcomed the move . </s>
<s> City officials there had been were aware that a large company was moving in , but negotiations had all been conducted through a law firm and under the code name `` Everglades . '' </s>
<s> `` When we were told it was Exxon , it was beyond all expectations ; what a coup , '' said Tom Lewis , senior vice president of Dallas Partnership , the economic development affiliate of the city 's Chamber of Commerce . </s>
<s> Dallas , its economy based on oil and real estate , has been in a slump . </s>
<s> Exxon said it will build a new headquarters on a 132-acre tract in the 10-year-old Las Colinas complex in the suburb of Irving . </s>
<s> Until the building is completed , Exxon will rent part of an existing office tower . </s>
<s> Las Colinas , once a huge Texas ranch , is a sprawling complex of office buildings , homes and recreational facilities that its developers have been struggling to populate in recent years . </s>
<s> Exxon officials said it will cost less to run its headquarters at Las Colinas than in New York . </s>
<s> The company wo n't say how much it will save , but during at its interim location , sources say it will likely pay rent of $ 10 to $ 15 per square foot . </s>
<s> Owners of the building in New York say they will be asking $ 50 per square foot for rent to fill the space that Exxon is vacating . </s>
<s> In Texas , taxes and development costs are also lower , they said . </s>
<s> Plus , one Exxon official said , by eliminating the typically long New York commutes between office and home , management will expect employees to work 40 hours a week in Dallas , rather than a 35-hour work week in New York . </s>
