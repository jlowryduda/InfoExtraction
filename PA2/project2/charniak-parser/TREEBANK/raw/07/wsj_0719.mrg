<s> When the going gets tough , it 's tough to trade stocks in continental Europe . </s>
<s> That 's the troubling conclusion reached by many international investors and money managers angry at the malfunctions on Continental stock exchanges during last week 's global market turbulence . </s>
<s> They say the recent market volatility has underscored the shortcomings of the way many European exchanges trade stocks . </s>
<s> The weaknesses of Continental exchanges are driving some fund managers to switch business to stocks traded on London 's stock exchange , which quotes firm trading prices for about 350 blue-chip issues from 12 major countries . </s>
<s> `` I 'm not saying London covered itself in glory , but the events of the past week have certainly exposed Europe 's weaknesses , '' says Stewart Gilchrist , a director of Scottish Amicable Investment Managers in Glasgow , Scotland , which manages about # 6 billion -LRB- $ 9.63 billion -RRB- in institutional money . </s>
<s> He says the problems on European exchanges included market-system breakdowns , delayed execution of buy and sell orders and trading suspensions . </s>
<s> `` The events strengthen London 's hand in becoming the center for trading European stocks , '' Mr. Gilchrist says . </s>
<s> Unable to unload a large block of a French blue-chip company 's shares in Paris for two days last week , a frustrated Scottish Amicable fund manager finally tossed down her phone in disgust and called James Capel & Co. , a London brokerage firm . </s>
<s> The firm did the trade in seconds on the London stock exchange 's SEAQ automated-quotation system . </s>
<s> On so-called Manic Monday , Oct. 16 , stock prices plunged across Europe and trading problems erupted . </s>
<s> London had some problems , too . </s>
<s> The London exchange 's electronic price-reporting system provided only indicative , or non-firm , prices for about 40 minutes on Manic Monday . </s>
<s> Some dealers say other traders were n't picking up their phones . </s>
<s> But London 's problems were nothing compared with the Continent 's . </s>
<s> In Brussels , which recently spent millions of dollars on a computer-assisted trading system , disgusted traders watched helplessly as a software failure before opening on Manic Monday prevented trading for two days . </s>
<s> For 48 hours , no one had any idea precisely how much his securities were worth . </s>
<s> By Wednesday , frustrated Belgian brokers reopened the market by using the time-honored method of quoting stocks with chalk on a blackboard . </s>
<s> The Belgian computer system finally was repaired and restarted on Tuesday of this week , with the aid of Toronto Stock Exchange officials who developed the system . </s>
<s> In Frankfurt , which only has a two-hour daily stock-trading session even in the best of times , stocks did n't open for the first 45 minutes because of order imbalances that brokers blame on a wave of sell orders from small investors . </s>
<s> As banks processed six-foot telexes of sell orders , the crush led to Manic Monday 's worst decline : German stocks ended down 13 % . </s>
<s> Exchange officials extended trading hours , 75 minutes on Monday and 65 minutes on Tuesday , to clear up order backlogs . </s>
<s> In France , more than half the top 25 blue-chip stocks -- including such giants as BSN and Elf Aquitaine -- did n't open until Wall Street rallied late in the European trading day , traders say . </s>
<s> The rally transformed some big sell orders into big buy orders , solving an order-imbalance problem . </s>
<s> But by that time , many big institutions had switched business to London . </s>
<s> `` Belgium was closed for two days , France closed for a couple of hours , Germany was stuck . </s>
<s> It was a nightmare , '' says Susan Noble , an investment manager at Robert Fleming Holdings Ltd. 's International Investment Management unit in London . </s>
<s> `` It 's very worrying that these markets ca n't cope . '' </s>
<s> On Manic Monday , the volume of German shares traded in London more than tripled to 2.2 million , and the volume of French shares rose 48 % . </s>
<s> -LRB- By comparison , German domestic stock volume in Frankfurt only doubled that day . -RRB- </s>
<s> The switch to the London market during such turbulent times is significant . </s>
<s> For one thing , the size of the affected market is enormous -- the European stock markets account for some 22.5 % of global stock market capitalization , with an estimated value of $ 2.175 trillion , according to Morgan Stanley Capital International . </s>
<s> The Continental markets alone contribute about 14.3 % of estimated world market capitalization of $ 9.671 trillion . </s>
<s> Though the widely traded shares that are quoted in London account for only a small portion of those totals , they still are the most closely watched stocks and are often viewed as a barometer for the local markets generally . </s>
<s> The switch to London underscores the fact that despite the economic restructuring associated with European Community efforts to develop a single market by 1992 , European stock trading remains a highly fragmented and very localized activity . </s>
<s> Against this backdrop , one thing that does n't seem likely to result from 1992 is a single European stock market . </s>
<s> Rather , there increasingly is a group of international brokerage and trading firms that operate in most European financial centers -- including European giants such as Barclays Bank PLC and Deutsche Bank , as well as Merrill Lynch & Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. of the U.S. and Japan 's Nomura Securities Co . </s>
<s> These firms , which often have acquired a local brokerage firm , are calling the shots when it comes to deciding in which market to transact a trade . </s>
<s> And senior officials of two U.S. securities houses say they switched trades in European stocks to the London market last week when they could n't unwind positions on the Continent . </s>
<s> Meantime , brokers on the Continent are worried , too , mostly by the potential loss of business . </s>
<s> `` I would be much happier if this volume -LCB- in German stocks -RCB- were in Frankfurt rather than London , '' says Dieter Bauernfeind , head of international equity sales at Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt . </s>
<s> He acknowledges that spreads `` were too wide and volumes too light '' in the extreme conditions on Manic Monday . </s>
<s> Already the Germans appear to be acting ; at a special meeting on the day of the decline , directors of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange voted to extend their trading hours , although they have n't decided when or by how much . </s>
<s> A Frankfurt exchange official , acknowledging the brokers ' anxieties , says the market still feels it `` functioned OK during this crash . '' </s>
<s> The Dutch , who had some trading problems because of insufficient computer capacity , say new equipment to solve the problems ought to be installed within a month . </s>
<s> Says a spokeswoman for the Brussels Bourse : `` Nobody around here will tell you they are happy the system did n't work . </s>
<s> But it 's just one of those things that happened . </s>
<s> Investors can be assured now that this kind of problem can never occur again . '' </s>
<s> But for others , the pledges echo the promises made after the 1987 stock crash , when similar problems led many markets to develop the new systems that performed so badly last week . </s>
<s> `` They all said they invested huge amounts of money . </s>
<s> But they either did n't buy the right machines or they wasted it , '' says Fleming 's Ms. Noble . </s>
