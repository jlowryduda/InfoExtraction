<s> As program trading comes under renewed attack for causing stock market gyrations , a few people on Wall Street say it is time to consider extreme measures . </s>
<s> The real answer to curbing wild swings in stock prices , they say , might be to curb or even abolish stock-index futures . </s>
<s> A stock-index future is a contract to buy or sell the market value of a basket of stocks , such as the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index . </s>
<s> Since stock futures were created in 1982 , trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and other exchanges has boomed to the point where trading in stock-index futures rivals that in the stocks themselves . </s>
<s> The conventional view , as voiced by Goldman , Sachs & Co. partner Fischer Black , is that stocks and `` derivatives '' such as futures and options `` form a single market , and that derivatives make it a more liquid market . '' </s>
<s> But increasingly , people are questioning that view , and the critics include some of the country 's most successful investors . </s>
<s> Warren Buffett has been on record as opposing stock-index futures since their inception in 1982 . </s>
<s> And Mario Gabelli , another star in the investing world , says , `` My gut says the negatives of futures and synthetics far outweigh the benefits . '' </s>
<s> Like others , Mr. Gabelli says that if futures cause investors to lose confidence in stocks , they will move away from stocks -- as many have already done . </s>
<s> And those who remain , he says `` will demand a higher return and over time raise the cost of capital to companies . '' </s>
<s> Essentially , the critics of stock-index futures fall into two camps . </s>
<s> One group says the futures contribute to stock market volatility ; the other contends that futures are a sideshow of speculation that detracts from the stock market 's basic function of raising capital . </s>
<s> `` Before futures , '' says New York investor Michael Harkins , `` you actually had to pay attention to whether the thing you were buying had any intrinsic value . '' </s>
<s> While it was once expected that futures would mimic stock prices , traders now routinely check the futures markets in Chicago before they buy or sell stocks . </s>
<s> When Chicago futures prices jump up or down , the New York Stock Exchange follows . </s>
<s> On Tuesday , for instance , the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 80 points in little more than an hour . </s>
<s> Then , in the space of a 20-minute coffee break , the average rallied almost all of the way back . </s>
<s> Paul Lesutis , who manages more than $ 3 billion of investments at Provident Capital Management Inc. , blames futures markets for leading the way . </s>
<s> `` The fundamentals do n't change in an hour , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` I think they should close down the futures exchange and then we could get back to investing . '' </s>
<s> Index arbitrage -- the rapid-fire buying and selling of stocks offset with opposite trades in futures -- is frequently blamed for adding to stock market volatility . </s>
<s> Although index arbitrage is said to add liquidity to markets , John Bachmann , managing partner of Edward D. Jones , says too much liquidity is n't a good thing </s>
<s> `` The kind of instant liquidity that is implied by index futures is that you can buy a portfolio over two years and get out in one day . </s>
<s> It 's too disruptive , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` It is n't investing . '' </s>
<s> But stock-index futures have plenty of support . </s>
<s> Defenders say futures make markets more efficient and provide ways for investors to reduce risks . </s>
<s> They note that stocks experienced volatile swings long before futures . </s>
<s> And , defenders say , few people complain about futures when stock prices are rising . </s>
<s> Louis Margolis , managing director in charge of equity options and futures at Salomon Inc. , says that trading baskets of stocks began in the 1970s , a decade before the advent of futures . </s>
<s> Futures , he says , merely cut down on trading costs . </s>
<s> He says `` blaming futures is like blaming the messenger . '' </s>
<s> Since stock-index arbitrage merely narrows the gap between prices in the futures and stock markets , it ca n't add to volatility , he says . </s>
<s> Futures `` do n't need defending , '' says Andrew Yemma , a spokesman for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , which trades the S&P 500 , by far the largest stock-index futures contract . </s>
<s> Despite the current outcry over stock market volatility , few people expect stock futures to disappear . </s>
<s> For one thing , the Chicago futures exchanges have political and financial clout -- including many friends in Congress . </s>
<s> And traders say that futures have become an accepted part of the financial landscape . </s>
<s> `` All life is about change -- either you adapt or die , '' says one Chicago futures trader . </s>
<s> `` If futures are n't permitted here , we 'll take it to Australia or Tokyo . '' </s>
<s> Average daily volume in S&P 500 futures last year was 44,877 contracts . </s>
<s> Based on yesterday 's closing price of the S&P , the average value of one day 's trading amounts to $ 7.6 billion . </s>
<s> By contrast , average dollar volume on the Big Board last year was $ 5.3 billion . </s>
<s> Many investment managers say futures are useful as a way to hedge portfolios . </s>
<s> If managers fear that the overall stock market will fall , but want to continue owning stocks , they can hold on to specific stocks and sell a corresponding amount of futures contracts . </s>

<s> And although criticism of futures generally comes from Wall Street , one Chicago futures trader notes that brokerage firms rely on futures as hedging tools when they buy and sell big blocks of stocks from institutions . </s>
<s> One reason futures are said to add volatility is that -- unlike in stocks -- people can speculate in futures with little money down . </s>
<s> Margin requirements for speculators on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are currently about 7 % . </s>
<s> `` For $ 10 million , you can move $ 100 million of stocks , '' a specialist on the Big Board gripes . </s>
<s> `` That gives futures traders a lot more power . '' </s>
<s> By contrast , an investor in stocks must put up 50 % in cash . </s>
<s> Some critics say futures encourage people to think of stocks as a single commodity , rather than as investments in individual businesses . </s>
<s> Thus , they say , futures inhibit the basic purpose of the stock market : to accurately price securities so that capital and investment flows where it 's needed most . </s>
<s> The S&P 500 index futures `` transferred the identity of 500 stocks into one unit - making them a simple commodity to trade , '' says George Kegler , senior vice president at A. Webster Dougherty in Philadelphia . </s>
<s> `` It took away the need to know the bad third-quarter report of IBM , for example , '' Mr. Kegler says . </s>
<s> Of course , portfolio trading -- the increasingly common practice of buying or selling baskets of actual stocks -- also treats stocks as homogenous commodities . </s>
<s> `` There is a class of investor that wants to be exposed '' to the whole market , says Sandip Bhagat , assistant vice president at Travelers Investment Management Co . </s>
<s> The S&P futures are merely a `` cheaper and quicker '' way to get access to all 500 stocks , he says . </s>
<s> The Big Board yesterday began trading in its own basket trading vehicle representing the S&P 500 stocks . </s>
<s> But owning index futures is n't the same as owning the underlying stocks . </s>
<s> Stockholders , as a group , can win , because they own a share of corporate earnings , which can grow and boost stock prices . </s>
<s> Futures , on the other hand , are a zero sum game -- a market for making side bets about the direction of stock prices . </s>
<s> `` You do n't own anything , '' says Stephen Boesel , a money manager for T. Rowe Price in Baltimore . </s>
<s> `` You 're making a pure bet on the market . </s>
