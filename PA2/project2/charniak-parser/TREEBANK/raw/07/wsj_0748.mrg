<s> When President Bush travels to Costa Rica today , he 'll go with little of the fanfare that accompanies many of his foreign travels . </s>
<s> But the two-day trip still has managed to fuel controversy over his administration 's policies in Central America . </s>
<s> Some conservatives say Mr. Bush should n't make the trip , during which he will participate in Costa Rica 's celebration of 100 years of democracy . </s>
<s> These critics object to Mr. Bush 's participation in a meeting that includes Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega among the guests . </s>
<s> In addition , they argue he wo n't help Washington 's standing in the region by trumpeting the U.S. commitment to democracy less than a month after his administration played an ineffectual role in the failed coup attempt in Panama . </s>
<s> `` I believe it will do more damage than good because it will legitimize people like Daniel Ortega , '' says Curtin Windsor , who served as U.S. ambassador to Costa Rica during the Reagan administration . </s>
<s> Mr. Windsor , among other analysts connected to the conservative Heritage Foundation , fears the gathering of 18 leaders , mostly from Central American nations , will force Mr. Bush `` to explain and redeem himself '' in the wake of charges that the U.S. failed to do enough to aid the removal of Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega . </s>
<s> At the same time , liberal and moderate Democrats note the irony of Mr. Bush 's joining a celebration of Costa Rican democracy at a time his administration has sought sharp cuts in U.S. aid to the tiny country . </s>
<s> The administration proposed only $ 57 million in so-called economic support funds for Costa Rica this year , down from the $ 90 million the U.S. provided last year . </s>
<s> The administration said improvements in Costa Rica 's economic condition warrant the cut in aid , which the country uses mainly to make payments on its $ 4.5 billion foreign debt . </s>
<s> But Costa Rican officials argue that the recent drop in coffee prices , combined with the country 's continuing struggle to reinvigorate its economy , make the support as necessary as ever . </s>
<s> `` We are crossing the river and we need a little more help to get to the other side , '' said Rodrigo Sotela , an economic affairs specialist at the Costa Rican Embassy in Washington . </s>
<s> Democrats argue that Costa Rica deserves more assistance for the same reason that Mr. Bush is attending the celebration this weekend : to reward the country for its stability in a region wracked with turmoil and for its efforts to promote peace in Nicaragua . </s>
<s> However , peace efforts by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias have n't always helped the country 's cause in Washington . </s>
<s> Mr. Arias 's long-time refusal to support the U.S. 's campaign against leftist Nicaragua earned him the ire of the Reagan White House . </s>
<s> And more recently , he insisted on signing a five-nation agreement intended to disarm Nicaragua 's U.S.-backed Contra rebels faster than the Bush administration would prefer . </s>
<s> `` I think Bush 's going there is a helpful sign , '' said Sen. Terry Sanford -LRB- D. , N.C . -RRB- a member of the Foreign Relations Committee who pushed to provide Costa Rica about the same amount of aid as it received last year . </s>
<s> Lawmakers in both houses support the higher level . </s>
<s> Administration officials defend Mr. Bush 's decision to make the trip . </s>
<s> While they acknowledge the president will attend several meals and a working session also attended by Mr. Ortega , they insist that Mr. Bush wo n't be extending the Nicaraguan leader any special courtesies . </s>
<s> The administration also made clear its continuing distate for the leftist Nicaraguan government in recent days , endorsing a package of electoral aid to the Nicaraguan opposition , renewing the U.S. trade embargo against the country and continuing to complain that the country supports rebel groups in the region . </s>
<s> Officials also insist Mr. Bush will use the trip to highlight his own initiatives for pushing democracy in the region , fighting illegal drugs and assisting the less developed countries . </s>
<s> `` Let me say there is a symbolic component to this trip , '' Secretary of State James Baker told reporters Wednesday . </s>
<s> `` There wo n't be any formal resolutions or communiques , I do n't think . </s>
<s> But we still see this as an opportunity to discuss many , many very important issues . </s>
