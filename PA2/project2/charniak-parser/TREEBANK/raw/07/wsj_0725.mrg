<s> Sam Ramirez and his men are late . </s>
<s> They pile out of their truck and furiously begin twisting together steel pipes linking a giant storage tank to the Sharpshooter , a freshly drilled oil well two miles deep . </s>
<s> If they finish today , the Sharpshooter can pump tomorrow . </s>
<s> One roustabout , hanging by his hands from a ladder , bounces his weight on a three-foot wrench to loosen a stuck fitting . </s>
<s> `` We 've been putting in long hours , '' Mr. Ramirez says -- six-day weeks and 13-hour days for the last two months . </s>
<s> A year ago , when almost nothing was happening amid these desolate dunes , `` you 'd spend two days working and two days in the yard , '' he recalls . </s>
<s> After a three-year nightmare of uncertain oil prices , draconian budget cuts and sweeping layoffs , fear is finally leaving the oil patch . </s>
<s> Independent drillers are gingerly sinking bits into the Earth 's crust again . </s>
<s> Some in Big Oil are easing the grip on their wallets . </s>
<s> Investment capital is creeping back , and oil properties are fetching more . </s>
<s> Oil-tool prices are even edging up . </s>
<s> What happened ? </s>
<s> In broadest terms , stability has quietly settled into international oil markets . </s>
<s> Mideast politics have calmed down and the squabbling within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries seems under control for now . </s>
<s> `` The fundamentals of supply and demand once again are setting oil prices , '' says Victor Burk , an Arthur Andersen & Co. oil expert . </s>
<s> After years of wild swings , oil prices over the last 12 months have settled at around $ 15 to $ 20 a barrel . </s>
<s> That is n't the $ 40 that delighted producers a decade ago or the $ 10 that pleased users a year ago . </s>
<s> But it is high enough to prod the search for future supplies , low enough to promote consumption and , most important , steady enough for both producers and users to believe in . </s>
<s> Not that oil suddenly is a sure thing again . </s>
<s> The current equilibrium is fragile and depends on steady , strong demand and continued relative harmony within OPEC , producer of more than 40 % of the non-Communist world 's crude . </s>
<s> A recession or new OPEC blowup could put oil markets right back in the soup . </s>
<s> Also , the new stirrings are faint , and some question their extent . </s>
<s> Drilling activity is still far below eight years ago , there 's no hiring surge and some companies continue to shrink . </s>
<s> With all this , even the most wary oil men agree something has changed . </s>
<s> `` It does n't appear to be getting worse . </s>
<s> That in itself has got to cause people to feel a little more optimistic , '' says Glenn Cox , the president of Phillips Petroleum Co . </s>
<s> Though modest , the change reaches beyond the oil patch , too . </s>
<s> The same roller-coaster prices that halted U.S. oil exploration and drove many veteran oil men and companies out of the business also played havoc with the nation 's inflation rate , the trade deficit and oil users ' corporate and personal budgets . </s>
<s> Now , at least some predictability has returned , for everyone from economists to motorists . </s>
<s> Corporate planners can plan again . </s>
<s> `` Management does n't want surprises , '' notes Jack Zaves , who , as fuel-services director at American Airlines , buys some 2.4 billion gallons of jet fuel a year . </s>
<s> Prices had been so unstable that two years ago Mr. Zaves gave up on long-term forecasts . </s>
<s> And consumers `` should be comfortable , '' adds W. Henson Moore , U.S. deputy secretary of energy . </s>
<s> `` I do n't see anything on the horizon that could lead to a precipitous rise in the price . '' </s>
<s> The catalyst for all this has been OPEC . </s>
<s> About a year ago , it ended an on-again , off-again internal production war that had put prices on a roller coaster and pitched oil towns from Houston to Caracas into recession . </s>
<s> Saudi Arabia , OPEC 's kingpin , abandoned a policy of flooding the market to punish quota-cheaters . </s>
<s> About the same time , the Iran-Iraq war , which was roiling oil markets , ended . </s>
<s> In addition , global petroleum demand has been climbing . </s>
<s> It is projected to keep growing by a million barrels a day , or up to 2 % annually , for years to come . </s>
<s> For OPEC , that 's ideal . </s>
<s> The resulting firm prices and stability `` will allow both producers and consumers to plan confidently , '' says Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer . </s>
<s> OPEC Secretary-General Subroto explains : Consumers offer security of markets , while OPEC provides security of supply . </s>
<s> `` This is an opportune time to find mutual ways -LCB- to prevent -RCB- price shocks from happening again , '' he says . </s>
<s> To promote this balance , OPEC now is finally confronting a long-simmering internal problem . </s>
<s> At its November meeting , it will try to revise its quotas to satisfy Persian Gulf members that can produce far more oil than their allotments . </s>
<s> Being held well below capacity greatly irritates them , and has led to widespread cheating . </s>
<s> OPEC has repeatedly raised its self-imposed production ceiling to legitimize some of that unauthorized output . </s>
<s> Oil ministers now hope to solve the issue for good through an Iranian proposal that gives a larger share of output to countries with surplus capacity and reduces the shares of those that ca n't produce more anyway . </s>
<s> But `` if they walk out without any effort to resolve their problem , production could increase to 23 million or 24 million barrels a day , making for a very troublesome first quarter , '' warns Nordine Ait-Laoussine , a consultant and former Algerian OPEC delegate . </s>
<s> That would send prices plummeting from what some gun-shy U.S. oil executives still regard as too low a level . </s>
<s> Patrick J . Early , president of Amoco Corp. 's oil-production unit , says that despite recent stability , he plans continued tightening of costs and exploration spending . </s>
<s> The view of some others in Big Oil , he maintains , `` is very much -LCB- similar to -RCB- Amoco 's outlook . '' </s>
<s> Just this week Mobil Corp. disclosed new cutbacks in its domestic exploration and production operations . </s>
<s> Out here on the Querecho Plains of New Mexico , however , the mood is more upbeat ; trucks rumble along the dusty roads and burly men in hard hats sweat and swear through the afternoon sun . </s>
<s> Santa Fe Energy Co. , a unit of Santa Fe Southern Pacific Co. , bought from Amoco the rights that allowed it to drill the Sharpshooter . </s>
<s> A mile and a half away looms the 150-foot-tall rig of the Sniper , due to be pumping by December . </s>
<s> `` Talk is that everybody is going to drill more wells , '' says foreman Tommy Folsom . </s>
<s> Santa Fe aims to drill about 30 wells in this area in 1989 and double that next year . </s>
<s> It is more aggressive than most , but it is n't the only company with a new attitude , as it found when it went looking for a partner for the Sharpshooter . </s>
<s> `` We went to six companies over two days pitching the prospect , '' says Tim Parker , a Santa Fe exploration manager . </s>
<s> `` Five were interested . '' </s>
<s> Mitchell Energy & Development Corp. became the partner , ponying up more than half of the $ 600,000 in drilling and start-up costs . </s>
<s> Mitchell will get a half-interest in the oil . </s>
<s> `` A kind of no-mistakes mentality '' had been stifling activity , says Don Covey , Mitchell 's oil exploration chief . </s>
<s> Now `` everybody is a lot more optimistic . '' </s>
<s> One attraction for oil operators here and in other fields is the bargain-basement cost of drilling and equipment , reflecting service companies ' hunger for work . </s>
<s> Kadane Oil Co. , a small Texas independent , is currently drilling two wells itself and putting money into three others . </s>
<s> One of its wells , in southwestern Oklahoma , is a `` rank wildcat , '' a risky well where oil previously has n't been found . </s>
<s> `` At this price , $ 18 plus or minus , and with costs being significantly less than they were several years ago , the economics are pretty good , '' says George Kadane , head of the company . </s>
<s> `` If you know you 've got stability in price , you can do things you would n't do with the volatility of the past few years . '' </s>
<s> The activity is enough to move some oil-service prices back up a little . </s>
<s> Some drill-bit prices have risen 5 % in the past month . </s>
<s> In the Gulf of Mexico , a boat to deliver supplies to offshore rigs now costs around $ 3,000 a day , up nearly 60 % since June . </s>
<s> Some service boats recently were auctioned for about $ 1.7 million each , up from less than $ 1 million two years ago . </s>
<s> At the bottom of the slump , Schlumberger Inc. was discounting 75 % on an electronic evaluation of a well ; now it discounts about 50 % , drillers say . </s>
<s> Still , there is money to be made . </s>
<s> Most oil companies , when they set exploration and production budgets for this year , forecast revenue of $ 15 for each barrel of crude produced . </s>
<s> Prices have averaged more than $ 2 a barrel higher than that -- not a windfall , but at least a pleasant bonus for them . </s>
<s> So , according to a Dun & Bradstreet Corp. survey , companies that had been refusing to spend even their very conservative budgets may loosen up before year end . </s>
<s> It says 40 % of those surveyed report that 1989 exploration spending will exceed 1988 's . </s>
<s> Funds for drilling may inch up more next year if oil prices stay stable . </s>
<s> Texaco , thinking in terms of $ 18-to-$19 oil for 1990 , may raise spending , especially for low-risk prospects , an official says . </s>
<s> Outside investors , scarce since '86 , are edging back . </s>
<s> Although `` it 's still difficult to raise money for a pure wildcat program , '' says William Thomas , a Texas Commerce Bank official in Houston , `` institutions are starting to see there are cycles to these things , and this one is beginning to turn . '' </s>
<s> Wall Street generally likes the industry again . </s>
<s> The appetite for oil-service stocks has been especially strong , although some got hit yesterday when Shearson Lehman Hutton cut its short-term investment ratings on them . </s>
<s> Contractors such as Parker Drilling Co. are raising cash again through stock offerings , and for the first time in years , two oil-service companies recently went public . </s>
<s> -LRB- They are Grace Energy Corp. of Dallas and Marine Drilling Co. of Houston . -RRB- </s>
<s> Most oil companies are still reluctant to add to the office and professional staffs they slashed so deeply . </s>
<s> But a few new spots are opening . </s>
<s> Arthur Andersen , the accounting firm , has increased its energy staff 10 % in a year . </s>
<s> Out in the oil fields , if activity picks up much more , shortages could appear because so many roughnecks , roustabouts and others left after the crash . </s>
<s> Already `` it 's hard to get people . </s>
<s> They 're so busy , '' says one Santa Fe drilling foreman here . </s>
<s> For most field workers , it 's about time . </s>
<s> Mr. Ramirez , who arrived late at the Sharpshooter with his crew because he had started early in the morning setting up tanks at another site , just got the first raise he can remember in eight years , to $ 8.50 an hour from $ 8 . </s>
<s> Norman Young , a `` mud-logger '' at the Sniper well , has worked all but about nine days of this year . </s>
<s> Last year , `` I was off a straight month , then one time for two to three weeks and another two to three weeks , '' he says . </s>
<s> Butch McCarty , who sells oil-field equipment for Davis Tool Co. , is also busy . </s>
<s> A native of the area , he is back now after riding the oil-field boom to the top , then surviving the bust running an Oklahoma City convenience store . </s>
<s> `` First year I came back there was n't any work , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` I think it 's on the way back now . </s>
<s> But it wo n't be a boom again . </s>
<s> No major booms , no major setbacks , '' he predicts . </s>
<s> Business has been good enough that he just took a spur-of-the-moment weekend trip to the mountain area of Cloudcroft , something `` I have n't done in years . '' </s>
<s> The figures confirm that there certainly is n't any drilling boom . </s>
<s> Only 14,505 wells , including 4,900 dry holes , were drilled for oil and natural gas in the U.S. in the first nine months of the year , down 22.4 % from the like 1988 period . </s>
<s> But that was off less than at midyear , when completions lagged by 27.1 % . </s>
<s> And the number of rigs active in the U.S. is inching up . </s>
<s> According to Baker Hughes Inc. , 992 rotary rigs were at work in the U.S. last week , up from the year-ago count of 933 . </s>
<s> -LRB- In 1981 , before the bust , the rig count was above 4,000 . -RRB- </s>
<s> Global offshore-rig use shows a similar upward trend . </s>
<s> Some equipment going to work is almost new . </s>
<s> Grace Energy just two weeks ago hauled a rig here 500 miles from Caspar , Wyo. , to drill the Bilbrey well , a 15,000-foot , $ 1-million-plus natural gas well . </s>
<s> The rig was built around 1980 , but has drilled only two wells , the last in 1982 . </s>
<s> Until now it had sat idle . </s>
<s> For Zel Herring , owner and a cook at the Sandhills Luncheon Cafe , a tin building in midtown , all this has made for a very good year . </s>
<s> After 11:30 a.m. or so `` we have them standing and waiting , '' she says , as she whips out orders for hamburgers and the daily special -LRB- grilled roast beef , cheese and jalapeno pepper sandwich on whole wheat , potato salad , baked beans and pudding , plus coffee or iced tea . </s>
<s> Price : $ 4.50 -RRB- . </s>
<s> Mike Huber , a roustabout , is even making it in his new career as an entrepreneur . </s>
<s> He started Arrow Roustabouts Inc. a year ago with a loan from a friend , since repaid , and now employs 15 . </s>
<s> He got three trucks and a backhoe cheap . </s>
<s> `` I want to add one more truck , '' Mr. Huber says . </s>
<s> I sense that it 's going to continue to grow . </s>
<s> That 's the word . </s>
<s> The word is out . </s>
