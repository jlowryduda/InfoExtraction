<s> On an office wall of the Senate intelligence committee hangs a quote from Chairman David Boren , `` Do n't hold your ticket 'til the show 's over . '' </s>
<s> He once used that line in a closed-door meeting on Panama , meaning do n't shrink from taking action against Manuel Noriega . </s>
<s> So how did a good senator like this end up approving a policy that required the U.S. to warn Mr. Noriega of any coup plot against him ? </s>
<s> `` I agree , it 's ridiculous , '' says Mr. Boren , and indeed by now ridiculous may be the only way to describe how the U.S. decides to take -- or rather , not to take -- covert action . </s>
<s> George Bush disclosed the policy last week by reading it to GOP senators , perhaps as a way of shifting blame for the Panama fiasco to Congress . </s>
<s> But the broader truth is more complicated -- and dismaying . </s>
<s> The policy was contained in an exchange of letters last October between the Senate intelligence committee and the CIA and National Security Council . </s>
<s> Staff lawyers for both sides were busy agreeing with one another about what the U.S. could not do to oust the Panamanian thug . </s>
<s> They simply got carried away with interpreting what the executive order banning assassinations really meant . </s>
<s> Mr. Boren himself did n't discover the warn-your-enemy nuance until Mr. Bush told him privately at the White House last week . </s>
<s> It 's ironic that David Boren should be in the center of this mire . </s>
<s> A former Oklahoma governor , he 's a thoughtful defender of presidential powers in foreign policy . </s>
<s> He 's a rare Democratic hawk . </s>
<s> He 's the senator most like Arthur Vandenberg , the GOP senator from Michigan who worked to forge a bipartisan foreign policy in the 1940s . </s>
<s> `` Vandenberg and Rayburn are heroes of mine , '' Mr. Boren says , referring as well to Sam Rayburn , the Democratic House speaker who cooperated with President Eisenhower . </s>
<s> `` They allowed this country to be credible . </s>
<s> I really want to see that happen again . '' </s>
<s> If this were 1949 , Mr. Boren might even succeed . </s>
<s> But in 1989 most senators have other ideas . </s>
<s> Last July , his committee rejected a Reagan administration plan to support a coup in Panama . </s>
<s> Ohio Democrat Howard Metzenbaum refused to support any plan that might get people hurt , a charming notion for a great power . </s>
<s> Maine Republican William Cohen said the plan might violate the assassination ban . </s>
<s> So the administration dropped it . </s>
<s> By October , when the committee rejected a much more modest covert proposal , even the administration was agreeing little should be done . </s>
<s> Mr. Boren does n't think all this influenced the failed coup this month , but he does concede that Congress has made mistakes . </s>
<s> `` In the aftermath of Vietnam , in the aftermath of Iran-Contra , I can understand some people might think that if they plan a coup , they have to bring their lawyers , '' he says . </s>
<s> But even Mr. Boren defends congressional oversight . </s>
<s> Writing in the Harvard International Review , he says that his committee approves covert operations only when there 's a `` consensus . '' </s>
<s> So what does consensus mean ? </s>
<s> `` It does n't mean unanimous , '' he insists , though he implies it means a bipartisan majority . </s>
<s> `` The sustainability of U.S. foreign policy is essential , '' he explains . </s>
<s> `` Why was containment so successful ? </s>
<s> Because it had bipartisan support . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Boren is confusing consensus on general principles with agreement on specific actions . </s>
<s> Elliott Abrams , a veteran of intelligence committee debates , doubts that even Grenada or the Libyan raid would have taken place if `` consensus '' had been required . </s>
<s> Vandenberg and Rayburn were wise enough to leave specific operations to presidents ; modern senators , Mr. Boren notwithstanding , are less modest . </s>
<s> The result is that the Senate committee has what amounts to veto power over every covert action . </s>
<s> `` I would n't say it 's quite a veto , '' Mr. Boren demurs . </s>
<s> But would n't a president who acted despite Senate objections be taking grave political risks ? </s>
<s> `` He would , '' agrees the chairman . </s>
<s> `` But that is something the president ought to know before he goes ahead . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Boren even spies a silver lining . </s>
<s> He figures the episode will help `` clarify any ambiguities '' between the committee and administration . </s>
<s> He points to a letter on his desk , his second in a week from President Bush , saying that they `` do n't disagree . '' </s>
<s> More broadly , Mr. Boren hopes that Panama will shock Washington out of its fear of using military power . </s>
<s> `` Maybe this will jolt us out of the post-Vietnam syndrome that we never are prepared to use force , '' he says . </s>
<s> Maybe -- if every senator shared the principles of Mr. Boren . </s>
<s> But it 's just as plausible to argue that if even David Boren can get mired in this sort of mess , the problem goes beyond legal interpretation . </s>
<s> Maybe the problem is a political system that wo n't act without an `` exchange of letters , '' that insists on running foreign policy by committee , that treats a president as just another guy at the table . </s>
<s> The reply of the Metzenbaums and Cohens is that we ca n't abolish these oversight committees because we 've seen too many abuses of executive power . </s>
<s> But Panama illustrates that their substitute is a system that produces an absurd gridlock . </s>
<s> The lawyers are now in charge of our national security . </s>
<s> In Panama , the U.S. interests at stake were happily minor ; the only people killed were foreigners hapless enough to trust American will . </s>
<s> Americans may not be so lucky the next time . </s>
