<s> California Thefts Make Travel Agents Jittery </s>
<s> BEING A TRAVEL agent used to be pretty glamorous . </s>
<s> Now it 's getting downright dangerous . </s>
<s> In recent months , more than 25 agencies have been robbed , compared with only a handful all last year , according to police and travel-agency groups . </s>
<s> Most of the cases have been in California , where one agent was stabbed and another was shot and killed . </s>
<s> Los Angeles police say the thieves seem to be part of a crime network that knows how to convert blank tickets into real ones . </s>
<s> Already , the stolen tickets have been used for flights all over the world . </s>
<s> So far , the thieves have stolen 3,632 blank tickets , according to Airline Reporting Corp. , a ticket processing center . </s>
<s> Police say the robberies are usually pulled off by two to five men , who walk into the agencies near closing or lunch time , when few employees are there . </s>
<s> `` They looked like ordinary vacationers at first , '' says Willy LLerena , owner of Travel Air Service in Monte Bello , Calif. , describing five men who entered his agency last June . </s>
<s> But then , he says , they put two loaded pistols to his temple and demanded he open the safe . </s>
<s> When he initially refused , he says , they stabbed him in the back and made off with $ 2,000 and 280 blank tickets . </s>
<s> `` They said they wanted to show me how serious they were , '' he says . </s>
<s> As word of the crime spree has spread , many agents have started changing their open-door policies . </s>
<s> At El Monte Travel Center in El Monte , Calif. , customers now can get in only through a buzzer and lock system . </s>
<s> `` It 's hard to deal with clients this way in a service business , '' says Ralph `` Bud '' Conner , owner of the agency , which was robbed of 180 blank tickets and $ 850 last month . </s>
<s> `` But we 're just too nervous . '' </s>
<s> The robberies also have set off a controversy involving the airlines . </s>
<s> Agents say airlines , which track ticket numbers of all stolen tickets , should be doing more to catch the thieves by confiscating the tickets when they 're used . </s>
<s> `` They have the most sophisticated computers in the world , '' says Mr. LLerena . </s>
<s> `` They ought to be able to do this . '' </s>
<s> But airlines say it would be too expensive and cause too many delays if they started using computerized scanners to check tickets at the gate . </s>
<s> Texans Get Reasonable Car Rental Insurance </s>
<s> CONSUMER advocates have long claimed that car rental companies charge too much for car rental insurance . </s>
<s> Now , a new law in Texas seems to be providing the proof . </s>
<s> The law -- the first of its kind -- requires car rental companies in Texas to charge only `` reasonable '' rates for collision-damage waiver insurance . </s>
<s> Specifically , the law says the rates must closely reflect what the company 's actual expenses have been to replace damaged cars . </s>
<s> Before the law went into effect last month , car rental companies were charging as much as $ 12 a day for the waiver in Texas . </s>
<s> Now , they 're charging as little $ 3 a day . </s>
<s> `` If they 're telling the truth now , then they 've been charging 300 % more than what is reasonable , '' says Steve Gardner , an assistant state attorney general in Texas . </s>
<s> A spokesman for Hertz Corp. acknowledges , `` The waiver is n't a source of protection for consumers , but a source of revenue . '' </s>
<s> But Hertz points out that at least it 's now charging only $ 3.95 a day in Texas , while some competitors are charging $ 6.99 . </s>
<s> The state attorney general 's office is investigating rental car agencies charging noticeably higher prices . </s>
<s> Flight Attendants Lag Before Jets Even Land </s>
<s> IF YOUR FLIGHT attendant seems a little weary , it may be because he or she has been working 20 straight hours . </s>
<s> A recent study for the Federal Aviation Administration found that major airlines sometimes make flight attendants work 16 hours or more straight -- despite union contracts at some airlines limiting duty time to 14 hours . </s>
<s> Some flight attendants on charter planes are putting in 20-hour work days , the study found . </s>
<s> This happens because the FAA does n't have any rules on duty time for flight attendants ; by contrast , it strictly restricts duty time for pilots and air traffic controllers , usually to a maximum of 10 consecutive hours . </s>
<s> `` As far as the FAA is concerned , '' says Matt Finucane , air safety director at the Association of Flight Attendants , `` flight attendants can work an unlimited number of hours . '' </s>
<s> Experts say such long hours for attendants pose a safety risk . </s>
<s> For instance , tired flight attendants might not react quickly enough during an emergency evacuation . </s>
<s> `` At the end of their day , they are zombies , '' says John Galipault , president of the Aviation Safety Institute , a public-interest group in Worthington , Ohio . </s>
<s> `` They have to work such long hours and then we expect them to be heroes if there 's an evacuation . '' </s>
<s> In response to the study , the FAA says it is considering changing its policy -- or lack of it -- on flight attendants . </s>
<s> The agency may not have much choice : A congressional bill has been introduced that would force the agency to limit flight attendant duty time to 14 hours on U.S. flights and 16 hours on international trips . </s>
<s> Odds and Ends </s>
<s> GOLF HAS BECOME the latest diversion for travelers stuck at some airports . </s>
<s> Simulated golf games , in which players hit golf balls into nets , have been installed at airports in Denver and Pittsburgh ... . </s>
<s> The average cost for breakfast at a `` decent '' hotel restaurant in New York is $ 17.12 , according to Corporate Travel magazine . </s>
<s> The cheapest , among 100 cities surveyed , was $ 5.11 in El Paso , Texas . </s>
