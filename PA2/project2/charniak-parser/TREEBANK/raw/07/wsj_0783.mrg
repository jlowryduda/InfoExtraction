<s> If you 're still wondering about the causes of the slump in the junk-bond market , consider the case of Columbia Savings & Loan . </s>
<s> The California thrift has just announced a $ 226 million third-quarter loss . </s>
<s> How did this happen ? </s>
<s> Well , when Congress in its recent S&L bailout mandated that the thrifts sell off all their junk-bond holdings by 1994 , it not only artificially increased the supply of these bonds in the market but also eliminated one of the few profitable investments thrifts have made . </s>
<s> But there is a grimly ironic twist to the Columbia loss . </s>
<s> As followers of the debate over a capital-gains tax cut know , there is much talk in Congress and indeed all over Washington about the need to `` encourage '' long-term investment and discourage the financial sector 's presumed obsession with the short term . </s>
<s> Now , we regard this as a largely phony issue , but the `` long term '' is nonetheless a big salon topic all around the Beltway . </s>
<s> It turns out that Columbia had this huge loss in large part because the new congressionally mandated rules forced it to adjust the book value of its soon-to-be-sold junk bonds to the lower of either their cost or market value . </s>
<s> They could no longer be classified as what Columbia regarded them , namely long-term investments . </s>
<s> Congress 's ham-handed treatment of the existing structure of junk-bond holdings reminds us of a story in the Journal earlier this year about the Baby Bell companies ' desire to have the court-ordered bans lifted on offering information services . </s>
<s> The issue of seeking relief from Congress was raised to Delbert Staley , the chairman of Nynex . </s>
<s> Mr. Staley replied : `` Legislation tends to be compromised . </s>
<s> I believe we have to take a shot at getting as much done as we can through the court , through Justice and through state and federal regulatory agencies . </s>
<s> I see Congress as a last resort . '' </s>
<s> Healthy thrifts such as Columbia or the junk-bond market itself should have been so lucky . </s>
<s> The reality of life in modern America is that if you want to wreck something that works , let it fall into the hands of Congress . </s>
