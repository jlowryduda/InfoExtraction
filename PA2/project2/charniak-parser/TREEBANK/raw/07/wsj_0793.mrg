<s> Ground zero of the HUD scandal is the Secretary 's `` discretionary fund , '' a honey pot used to fund projects that were n't approved through normal HUD channels . </s>
<s> Jack Kemp wants to abolish it . </s>
<s> Instead , Congress 's idea of reform is to increase this slush fund by $ 28.4 million . </s>
<s> And transfer control of much of it to Capitol Hill . </s>
<s> The HUD scandals will simply continue , but under new mismanagement . </s>
<s> After one of the most amazing debates we 've ever seen on the cable channel C-SPAN , the House voted 250 to 170 on Wednesday to order $ 28.4 million in spending for a New Jersey arts center , a Michigan library and 38 other pet projects out of the same discretionary fund that was supposed to have been so abused during Sam Pierce 's tenure . </s>
<s> HUD has no paper work whatsoever on 30 of the projects , none of the others has been approved and not a single congressional hearing has been held on any of them . </s>
<s> However , four are in the Michigan district of Rep. Bob Traxler , the chairman of the House subcommittee that writes the HUD spending bill . </s>
<s> Of course , this kind of blatant congressional pork-barreling is called `` constituent service '' by Members , while the same kind of noncompetitive favoritism at HUD is labeled `` influence peddling . '' </s>
<s> Unlike those awful Republican consultants , Members do n't profit directly from HUD projects . </s>
<s> They merely collect campaign contributions from developers that help keep them in office . </s>
<s> The 40 pet projects were discovered buried in the appropriations bill for HUD and some other agencies after it returned from a conference committee that was called to resolve differences between the House and Senate versions . </s>
<s> Conference committees are breeding grounds for mischief . </s>
<s> They are often closed to the public and no minutes are taken . </s>
<s> Members find it easy to doctor legislation by slipping in special provisions that could never survive in the cold light of day . </s>
<s> In this case , the Members outdid themselves . </s>
<s> They transferred some $ 28 million from the Community Development Block Grant program designated largely for low - and moderate-income projects and funneled it into such items as : -- $ 1.2 million for a performing-arts center in Newark , -- $ 1.3 million for `` job retention '' in Hawaiian sugar mills . -- $ 400,000 for a collapsing utility tunnel in Salisbury , -- $ 500,000 for `` equipment and landscaping to deter crime and aid police surveillance '' at a Michigan park . -- $ 450,000 for `` integrated urban data based in seven cities . '' No other details . -- $ 390,000 for a library and recreation center at Mackinac Island , Mich . </s>
<s> Rep. Traxler recently purchased an unimproved building lot on the island . </s>
