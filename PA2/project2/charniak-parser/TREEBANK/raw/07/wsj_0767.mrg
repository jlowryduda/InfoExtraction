<s> The Federal Communications Commission allowed American Telephone & Telegraph Co. to continue offering discount phone services for large-business customers and said it would soon re-examine its regulation of the long-distance market . </s>
<s> The FCC moves were good news for AT&T , which has been striving since the breakup of the phone system for greater latitude in pricing and reduced regulation . </s>
<s> Alfred Sikes , the new FCC chairman , championed deregulation of AT&T at his last job as head of a Commerce Department telecommunications agency . </s>
<s> But it has been an open question whether Mr. Sikes , an extraordinarily cautious man , would continue pushing deregulation at the FCC in the face of what is likely to be great political pressure . </s>
<s> `` It means that Sikes is serious about the deregulation of long distance , '' said Jack Grubman , a telecommunications analyst at PaineWebber Inc. , who attended the FCC meeting . </s>
<s> `` All the commissioners were in amazing agreement -LCB- to re-examine regulation -RCB- for only having been together for a few months . '' </s>
<s> The FCC took three specific actions regarding AT&T . </s>
<s> By a 4-0 vote , it allowed AT&T to continue offering special discount packages to big customers , called Tariff 12 , rejecting appeals by AT&T competitors that the discounts were illegal . </s>
<s> Then by a separate 4-0 vote , it chose the narrowest possible grounds to strike down a different discount plan , called Tariff 15 , that AT&T offered to Holiday Corp . </s>
<s> AT&T gave a 5 % to 10 % discount to the Memphis , Tenn. , company that oversees Holiday Inns , in response to a similar discount offered to Holiday Corp. by MCI Communications Corp . </s>
<s> The agency said that because MCI 's offer had expired AT&T could n't continue to offer its discount plan . </s>
<s> But the agency specifically did n't rule whether AT&T had the right to match offers by competitors if that means giving discounts not generally available to other phone users . </s>
<s> Indeed , Joe Nacchio , AT&T 's vice president for business-communications services , said AT&T offered a similar Tariff 15 discount to Resort Condominium International , of Indianapolis , to meet another MCI bid . </s>
<s> The FCC `` did n't say I could n't do it again , '' he said . </s>
<s> Apart from those two actions , Mr. Sikes and the three other commissioners said they expect to re-examine how AT&T is regulated since competition has increased . </s>
<s> Richard Firestone , chief of the FCC 's common-carrier bureau , said he expected the agency to propose new rules next year . </s>
<s> AT&T applauded the FCC 's actions . </s>
<s> `` The time is long overdue to take a look at the fierce competition in the long-distance business and the rules governing it , '' the New York telecommunications firm said in a statement . </s>
<s> But MCI , of Washington , was displeased with the FCC decision concerning Tariff 12 , arguing that `` AT&T can not be allowed to flaunt FCC rules . '' </s>
<s> United Telecommunications Inc. 's US Sprint unit said it was `` obviously disappointed '' with the FCC decision on Tariff 12 . </s>
<s> US Sprint said was it will petition the FCC decision in federal court . </s>
<s> `` We believe that the court will find it unlawful , '' said a US Sprint spokesman . </s>
<s> Separately , AT&T filed a countersuit against MCI accusing it of misleading consumers through allegedly `` false and deceptive '' advertising . </s>
<s> The AT&T action was the most recent blow in a nasty fight . </s>
<s> Earlier this month , MCI sued AT&T in federal district court , claiming that AT&T 's ads are false . </s>
<s> AT&T assembled three of its top executives in Washington , all visibly angry , to try to refute MCI 's charges . </s>
<s> `` MCI has made hawks out of the upper echelon of AT&T , '' said PaineWebber 's Mr. Grubman , who said he expected AT&T to become increasingly aggressive in dealing with its longtime nemesis . </s>
