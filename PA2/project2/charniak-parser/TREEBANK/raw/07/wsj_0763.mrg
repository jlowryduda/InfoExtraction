<s> The Justice Department said it is seeking to join a private lawsuit challenging a Pittsburgh suburb 's zoning ordinance that sharply restricts the locations available to group homes for the handicapped . </s>
<s> This would be the department 's first suit challenging a local zoning ordinance under 1988 amendments to the Fair Housing Act . </s>
<s> Under those amendments , which took effect in March of this year , the federal government can intervene in private housing-discrimination lawsuits . </s>
<s> The ordinance , in Moon Township , prohibits locating a group home for the handicapped within a mile of another such facility . </s>
<s> In papers filed with the federal district court in Pittsburgh , the Justice Department alleged that the ordinance , by limiting the number of group homes that can be established in the township , makes housing unavailable on account of handicap . </s>
<s> The private suit was brought by three mentally retarded people who live in a group home in Moon . </s>
<s> Greg Smith , Moon Township manager , said the ordinance is intended to prevent the concentration of group homes for the mentally retarded from changing `` the character and flavor of the neighborhood . '' </s>
<s> He said the ordinance also will benefit the mentally retarded . </s>
<s> `` Our intent is to spread them out '' to insure they are well integrated into the community , he said . </s>
