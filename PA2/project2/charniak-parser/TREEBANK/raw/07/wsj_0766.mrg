<s> Toni Johnson pulls a tape measure across the front of what was once a stately Victorian home . </s>
<s> A deep trench now runs along its north wall , exposed when the house lurched two feet off its foundation during last week 's earthquake . </s>
<s> A side porch was ripped away . </s>
<s> The chimney is a pile of bricks on the front lawn . </s>
<s> The remainder of the house leans precariously against a sturdy oak tree . </s>
<s> The petite , 29-year-old Ms. Johnson , dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt as she slogs through the steady afternoon rain , is a claims adjuster with Aetna Life & Casualty . </s>
<s> She has been on the move almost incessantly since last Thursday , when an army of adjusters , employed by major insurers , invaded the San Francisco area to help policyholders sift through the rubble and restore some order to their lives . </s>
<s> Equipped with cellular telephones , laptop computers , calculators and a pack of blank checks , they parcel out money so their clients can find temporary living quarters , buy food , replace lost clothing , repair broken water heaters , and replaster walls . </s>
<s> Some of the funds will used to demolish unstable buildings and clear sites for future construction . </s>
<s> Many adjusters are authorized to write checks for amounts up to $ 100,000 on the spot . </s>
<s> They do n't flinch at writing them . </s>
<s> `` That 's my job -- get -LCB- policyholders -RCB- what they 're entitled to , '' says Bill Schaeffer , a claims supervisor who flew in from Aetna 's Bridgeport , Conn. , office . </s>
<s> The Victorian house that Ms. Johnson is inspecting has been deemed unsafe by town officials . </s>
<s> But she asks a workman toting the bricks from the lawn to give her a boost through an open first-floor window . </s>
<s> Once inside , she spends nearly four hours measuring and diagramming each room in the 80-year-old house , gathering enough information to estimate what it would cost to rebuild it . </s>
<s> She snaps photos of the buckled floors and the plaster that has fallen away from the walls . </s>
<s> While she works inside , a tenant returns with several friends to collect furniture and clothing . </s>
<s> One of the friends sweeps broken dishes and shattered glass from a countertop and starts to pack what can be salvaged from the kitchen . </s>
<s> Others grab books , records , photo albums , sofas and chairs , working frantically in the fear that an aftershock will jolt the house again . </s>
<s> The owners , William and Margie Hammack , are luckier than many others . </s>
<s> A few years ago , Mrs. Hammack insisted on buying earthquake insurance for this house , which had been converted into apartments . </s>
<s> Only about 20 % of California home and business owners carried earthquake coverage . </s>
<s> The Hammacks ' own home , also in Los Gatos , suffered comparatively minor damage . </s>
<s> Ms. Johnson , who works out of Aetna 's office in Walnut Creek , an East Bay suburb , is awed by the earthquake 's destructive force . </s>
<s> `` It really brings you down to a human level , '' she says . </s>
<s> `` It 's hard to accept all the suffering people are going through , but you have to . </s>
<s> If you do n't , you ca n't do your job . '' </s>
<s> For Aetna and other insurers , the San Francisco earthquake hit when resources in the field already were stretched . </s>
<s> Most companies still are trying to sort through the wreckage caused by Hurricane Hugo in the Carolinas last month . </s>
<s> Aetna , which has nearly 3,000 adjusters , had deployed about 750 of them in Charlotte , Columbia , and Charleston . </s>
<s> Adjusters who had been working on the East Coast say the insurer will still be processing claims from that storm through December . </s>
<s> It could take six to nine months to handle the earthquake-related claims . </s>
<s> When the earthquake rocked northern California last week , Aetna senior claims executives from the San Francisco area were at the company 's Hartford , Conn. , headquarters for additional training on how to handle major catastrophes , including earthquakes . </s>
<s> Since commercial airline flights were disrupted , the company chartered three planes to fly these executives back to the West Coast and bring along portable computers , cellular phones and some claims adjusters . </s>
<s> Because of the difficulty of assessing the damages caused by the earthquake , Aetna pulled together a team of its most experienced claims adjusters from around the country . </s>
<s> Even so , few had ever dealt with an earthquake . </s>
<s> Some adjusters , like Alan Singer of San Diego , had been working in Charleston for nearly four weeks . </s>
<s> He returned home last Thursday , packed a bag with fresh clothes and reported for duty Friday in Walnut Creek . </s>
<s> Offices were set up in San Francisco and San Jose . </s>
<s> In a few instances , Aetna knew it would probably be shelling out big bucks , even before a client called or faxed in a claim . </s>
<s> For example , officials at Walnut Creek office learned that the Amfac Hotel near the San Francisco airport , which is insured by Aetna , was badly damaged when they saw it on network television news . </s>
<s> `` The secret to being a good adjuster is counting , '' says Gerardo Rodriguez , an Aetna adjuster from Santa Ana . </s>
<s> `` You have to count everything . '' </s>
<s> Adjusters must count the number of bathrooms , balconies , fireplaces , chimneys , microwaves and dishwashers . </s>
<s> But they must also assign a price to each of these items as well as to floors , wallcoverings , roofing and siding , to come up with a total value for a house . </s>
<s> To do that , they must think in terms of sheetrock by the square foot , carpeting by the square yard , wallpaper by the roll , molding by the linear foot . </s>
<s> Using a calculator and a unit-price guide for such jobs as painting , plumbing and roofing in each major region of the country , adjusters can figure out the value of a home in today 's market and what it would cost to rebuild it . </s>
<s> Sometimes repairs are out of the question . </s>
<s> When Aetna adjuster Bill Schaeffer visited a retired couple in Oakland last Thursday , he found them living in a mobile home parked in front of their yard . </s>
<s> The house itself , located about 50 yards from the collapsed section of double-decker highway Interstate 880 , was pushed about four feet off its foundation and then collapsed into its basement . </s>
<s> The next day , Mr. Schaeffer presented the couple with a check for $ 151,000 to help them build a new home in the same neighborhood . </s>
<s> He also is working with a real-estate agent to help find them an apartment to rent while their home is being built . </s>
<s> Many of the adjusters employed by Aetna and other insurers have some experience with construction work or carpentry . </s>
<s> But such skills were alien to Toni Johnson . </s>
<s> Four years ago , she was managing a film-processing shop and was totally bored . </s>
<s> A friend mentioned that she might want to look into a position at Aetna , if she was interested in a job that would constantly challenge her . </s>
<s> She signed up , starting as an `` inside '' adjuster , who settles minor claims and does a lot of work by phone . </s>
<s> A year later , she moved to the commercial property claims division . </s>
<s> She spent a month at an Aetna school in Gettysburg , Pa. , learning all about the construction trade , including masonry , plumbing and electrical wiring . </s>
<s> That was followed by three months at the Aetna Institute in Hartford , where she was immersed in learning how to read and interpret policies . </s>
<s> Her new line of work has some perils . </s>
<s> Recently , a contractor saved her from falling three stories as she investigated what remained of an old Victorian house torched by an arsonist . </s>
<s> `` I owe that contractor . </s>
<s> I really do , '' she says . </s>
<s> As Ms. Johnson stands outside the Hammack house after winding up her chores there , the house begins to creak and sway . </s>
<s> The ground shakes underneath her . </s>
<s> It is an aftershock , one of about 2,000 since the earthquake , and it makes her uneasy . </s>
<s> The next day , as she prepares a $ 10,000 check for the Hammacks , which will cover the cost of demolishing the house and clearing away the debris , she jumps at the slightest noise . </s>
<s> On further reflection , she admits that venturing inside the Hammacks ' house the previous day was n't `` such a great idea . '' </s>
<s> During her second meeting with the Hammacks , Ms. Johnson reviews exactly what their policy covers . </s>
<s> They would like to retrieve some appliances on the second floor , but wonder if it 's safe to venture inside . </s>
<s> Ms. Johnson tells them that , if the appliances ca n't be salvaged , their policy covers the replacement cost . </s>
<s> Mr. Hammack is eager to know what Aetna will pay for the house , which has to come down . </s>
<s> `` When will I get that check for a million dollars ? '' he jokes . </s>
<s> The adjuster had n't completed all the calculations , but says : `` We 're talking policy limits . '' </s>
<s> In this case , that 's about $ 250,000 . </s>
<s> It suddenly dawns on Mr. Hammack that rebuilding the house in Los Gatos , an affluent community in Santa Clara County , may cost more than Aetna 's policy will pay . </s>
<s> `` We can lose money on this , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` And you did n't want me to buy earthquake insurance , '' says Mrs. Hammack , reaching across the table and gently tapping his hand . </s>
<s> Earthquake insurance costs about $ 2 to $ 4 annually for every $ 1,000 of value , and high deductibles mean it generally pays only when there is a catastrophe . </s>
<s> So , many Californians believe they can get by without it . </s>
<s> Even Ms. Johnson herself made that assumption . </s>
<s> `` I always knew that the ` Big One ' was coming , but not during my lifetime , '' she says . </s>
<s> Now she says she 's thinking of contacting her own insurance agent . </s>
<s> For Ms. Johnson , dealing with the earthquake has been more than just a work experience . </s>
<s> She lives in Oakland , a community hit hard by the earthquake . </s>
<s> She did n't have hot water for five days . </s>
<s> The apartment she shares with a 12-year-old daughter and her sister was rattled , books and crystal hit the floor , but nothing was severely damaged . </s>
<s> Her sister , Cynthia , wishes Toni had a different job . </s>
<s> `` We worry about her out there , '' Cynthia says . </s>
<s> Last Sunday , Ms. Johnson finally got a chance to water her plants , but stopped abruptly . </s>
<s> `` I realized I could n't waste this water when there are people in Watsonville who do n't have fresh water to drink . '' </s>
<s> She has n't played any music since the earthquake hit , out of respect for those who died on Interstate 880 where the roadway collapsed . </s>
