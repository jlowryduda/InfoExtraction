<s> I was impressed by the perceptiveness of your Sept. 12 story `` Rural Enterprise : Tough Row To Hoe . '' </s>
<s> We lived in rural areas many years , but now live in St. Louis County , Mo . </s>
<s> This morning as I drove the 13 miles to my law office and endured the routine heavy traffic during that twice-daily journey , I thought of how fortunate it was that we made the decision to be residents of an expanding community with so many opportunities and where so much is happening . </s>
<s> The presence of so many people , cars and competing businesses is evidence of a healthy economy in a place where people want to live . </s>
<s> I thought back to our time in small , sparsely populated communities . </s>
<s> I remembered how hard it was for an outsider to become accepted by long-established , stake-holding residents , and what pitfalls awaited an original thinker in societies that were long accustomed to unchanging , `` safe '' ways of thought and action . </s>
<s> I remembered being fired at age 44 , with five children at home , when my views and actions were deemed unsettling by a timid , small-town employer . </s>
<s> How difficult it is for a thinking person to live among societies rooted in the past . </s>
<s> Now , I revel in the freedom , culture , activity and diversity of this great metropolitan area with its traffic jams and perpetual road-building projects . </s>
<s> Yet when my youngest child died two years ago , I buried him in the church cemetery of a small Missouri town . </s>
<s> So after all , even the bitterest critic of rural exclusivity harbors a continuing yearning for those scarce , rural virtues thought to exist amid fields , forests and country lanes . </s>
