<s> They want late-night shuttles to the biology labs . </s>
<s> They want a 24-hour library . </s>
<s> And like college radicals everywhere , they are talking about a demonstration -- where protesters would gather quietly near the science building and raise their hands , classroom style . </s>
<s> Such is the fiber of the wool that woolly intellectuals let fly at gatherings of Harvard University 's new Society of Nerds and Geeks , or SONG . </s>
<s> SONGsters are mad as heck about campus anti-intellectualism and they are n't going to take it anymore , at least not without trying a few really neat ideas first . </s>
<s> `` We could have called ourselves the Academic Intellectual Society , but then everyone would have said , ` Oh , you mean the nerd-and-geek club , ' '' Leonid Fridman , SONG 's graduate-student adviser , told 19 attendees at the club 's inaugural meeting earlier this month . </s>
<s> Membership has since swelled to between 20 and 25 . </s>
<s> Some people may think of nerds as calculator-toting , socially awkward individuals with shirt-pocket liners for their pencils and a preoccupation with computers and matters numerical . </s>
<s> Geeks , by at least one definition , are chicken-mutilating circus freaks . </s>
<s> But SONG founder Jeremy Kahn , a Harvard junior , thinks of nerds and geeks more as `` nonconformists , '' albeit with a studious bent . </s>
<s> One of the group 's first projects is a `` procrastination hot line '' that students could call when they have an urge to delay studying . </s>
<s> The club plans to show nerdy movies , such as `` Real Genius , '' in which physics whizzes pop corn with lasers ; and naturally , the `` Revenge of the Nerds , '' a tale of college males with runny noses and ill-fitting pants . </s>
<s> One of its `` more ambitious goals '' is to get Jaime Escalante , the Los Angeles high-school mathematics teacher featured in the film `` Stand and Deliver , '' to come to Harvard for a guest lecture . </s>
<s> Nerds and geeks sometimes find themselves a bit isolated at Harvard . </s>
<s> So Mr. Kahn says high priority is being given to creating a computerized matchmaking service `` where instead of being matched for eye color , you could be matched for similar intellectual interests . '' </s>
<s> For instance ? </s>
<s> `` I 'm a math major , but I want to know about psychobiology . </s>
<s> Hopefully , I 'd find someone in psychobiology who wanted to know more about mathematics . '' </s>
<s> It could work . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , finding a volunteer to write the computer program is n't a problem . </s>
