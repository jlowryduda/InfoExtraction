<s> At a time when foreign banks are pouring vast resources and personnel into West Germany 's financial center , the opening of a three-man office on a Frankfurt side street should n't attract much attention . </s>
<s> Unless , of course , it happens to be run by the Rothschilds . </s>
<s> After an 88-year absence from the birthplace of the family banking empire , the return of the Rothschild group to Frankfurt was greeted by the glare of television lights , curious reporters and a mayoral reception in Town Hall . </s>
<s> Like other foreign banks establishing a presence here , the family describes its move as a calculated decision to set up a financial services outlet in Europe 's largest economy ahead of the integration of European Community markets after 1992 . </s>
<s> Yet the Rothschilds do n't deny an emotional element to the decision . </s>
<s> In 1796 , Mayer Amschel Rothschild founded Bankhaus M.A. Rothschild & Sons and later sent his four sons to London , Paris , Vienna and Naples to begin the bank 's expansion during the early 19th century . </s>
<s> The original bank in Frankfurt closed in 1901 after the death of Wilhelm Carl von Rothschild , and the family 's banking activities focused on London and Paris . </s>
<s> Baron Elie de Rothschild , the family 's elder spokesman , explains that by the end of the 19th century , Berlin had replaced Frankfurt as Germany 's financial center . </s>
<s> Yet the chief reason for the closure , he says , was rooted in a family tradition that would n't allow a bank to bear the Rothschild name without a Rothschild in its management . </s>
<s> `` At the time we had only daughters , '' explains the 72-year-old patriarch , `` so we had to close the bank . '' </s>
<s> Much of the family 's mystique remained . </s>
<s> Although its palatial residence was destroyed by bombs during World War II , the Rothschilds ' place in Frankfurt 's history is still recalled by the city park and a street bearing the Rothschild name . </s>
<s> The family 's long absence is understandable . </s>
<s> The family was in Allied countries during both World War I and the long period of economic strife of the 1920s . </s>
<s> During the Third Reich , the Rothschilds were a target of Nazi propaganda against Jewish financiers . </s>
<s> The persecution pursued the Rothschilds across Europe as the Nazis grabbed countries , confiscating the family 's property in the process . </s>
<s> American journalist William L. Shirer , in his book `` The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich , '' wrote of how in Vienna he had witnessed `` squads of -LCB- Nazi -RCB- SS men carting off silver , tapestries , paintings and other loot from the Rothschild palace . '' </s>
<s> In the immediate postwar years , the Rothschilds concentrated on rebuilding their other European operations , delaying their return to Frankfurt . </s>
<s> `` For a member of the Rothschild family , the return to Frankfurt is a very meaningful event , although it might not mean as much to German banking as it means to us , '' says Baron David de Rothschild , Elie 's younger cousin and a partner in Rothschild & Cie . Banque in Paris . </s>
<s> Indeed , the competition is n't greatly concerned . </s>
<s> `` It would be surprising if they did n't come to Frankfurt in time for 1992 , and they bring an interesting tradition . </s>
<s> But the market really is n't going to be stood on its head , '' said a banker at one of Frankfurt 's Big Three banks . </s>
<s> The return of the Rothschilds is modest . </s>
<s> The new representative office , with one manager and two assistants -- none a member of the Rothschild family -- will carry out no banking operations of its own . </s>
<s> Instead , it is to seek out corporate financing business and sell investment products on behalf of the family 's mainstay banking units : N M Rothschild & Sons Ltd. in London , Rothschild & Cie. in Paris and Rothschild Bank AG in Zurich . </s>
<s> The constraints do n't bother the office 's 54-year-old manager , Erich Stromeyer . </s>
<s> He left his job as general manager of Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. 's Frankfurt office because , he says , `` When the Rothschilds called , I could n't resist . '' </s>
<s> Each Rothschild bank is linked by family ties and cross-ownership . </s>
<s> In March , N M Rothschild in London and Rothschild Bank in Zurich showed assets of # 4.1 billion -LRB- $ 6.51 billion -RRB- and 1.26 billion Swiss francs -LRB- $ 774 million -RRB- , respectively . </s>
<s> The Paris bank does n't publish that figure . </s>
<s> In Europe , the Rothschilds banks are focusing on mergers and acquisitions as European industry restructures ahead of 1992 . </s>
<s> Yet the group 's limited resources makes it a niche player . </s>
<s> `` Obviously , there are quantitative limitations on the assistance we can provide , '' concedes Baron David de Rothschild , `` but we feel we have some cards to play . '' </s>
<s> Among them , he says , is the family 's traditional ties to old wealth and decision-makers in banking and industry throughout Europe and beyond . </s>
<s> The Rothschilds hope to use a long history in private banking and an aura of exclusivity to attract private and institutional investors . </s>
<s> As at the Zurich bank , the minimum investment for individuals will be high : about a million German marks -LRB- $ 538,000 -RRB- , three times what many other West German investment banks require . </s>
<s> `` But we do make exceptions , '' says a smiling Baron Elie de Rothschild , `` especially if they are very young and have very rich parents . </s>
