<s> Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said that Congress should grant the Securities and Exchange Commission the power to close the stock markets in periods of crisis . </s>
<s> In testimony to the Senate securities subcommittee , Mr. Brady disputed the view of SEC Chairman Richard Breeden , who told a House panel Wednesday that he does n't want the ability to halt the markets . </s>
<s> Mr. Breeden contended that discretionary power could have an impact on the markets if rumors were to circulate about when the exchanges might be closed . </s>
<s> He added that the president already has the power to close the markets in an emergency . </s>
<s> But Mr. Brady argued that the SEC is closer to the markets and in a better position to understand when the exchanges are under such stress that they should be closed . </s>
<s> Separately , Mr. Brady said he asked the Working Group on Financial Markets to determine whether futures margins are too low . </s>
<s> He noted that some minimum margin requirements have been reduced to levels below those before the 1987 crash . </s>
<s> `` This raises questions whether futures and equity margin requirements are consistent at these levels and whether futures margins are adequate , '' Mr. Brady said . </s>
<s> Margins are the amount of money an investor needs to put up to buy or sell a futures contract . </s>
<s> Margins on the futures exchanges typically are raised and lowered according to market volatility . </s>
<s> The Chicago Mercantile Exchange margins for the Standard & Poor 's 500 stock-index futures stood at $ 10,000 a contract for speculators and $ 5,000 for hedgers before Oct. 16 , 1987 ; that day the hedging margin was raised to $ 7,500 . </s>
<s> Margins were raised or lowered about a dozen times since the crash Oct. 19 , 1987 . </s>
<s> Currently , they stand at $ 12,000 for speculators , who are typically individuals and non-member traders , and $ 6,000 for hedgers , which are usually institutions and have offsetting positions in the underlying stocks . </s>
<s> Mr. Brady also said he expects the leveraged buy-out phenomenon to `` end under -LRB- its -RRB- own weight . '' </s>
<s> Asked whether there is anything Congress should do to curb the LBO boom , Mr. Brady responded , `` I think the LBO phenomenon , -LRB- while -RRB- it wo n't stop completely , will be a thing of the past . '' </s>
<s> Before taking any action , he advised the panel to `` see what the market has produced as a cure . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Brady also agreed with senators ' concerns about recent stock-market volatility , and said he realizes that the gyrations are scaring investors from investing in stocks . </s>
<s> But he added that individuals still are participating in the equity market indirectly through mutual funds and pension funds . </s>
<s> The former Wall Street executive refused to offer an opinion on the controversy surrounding program trading , which has recently become a larger part of the trading in the market and has been blamed for accelerating the drop two weeks ago . </s>
<s> `` I do not have a view of whether we should do anything about program trading at this time , '' he said . </s>
<s> But Mr. Brady endorsed the market-revision bill that both houses of Congress will try to push through this session . </s>
<s> That bill , proposed by the SEC last year , would require brokerage firms to disclose the financial positions of their holding companies , mandate large traders ' reporting of program or block trades , and improve clearing and settlement of trades between the futures and stock markets . </s>
<s> The bill also would give the SEC the power to close the markets , a discretion that former SEC Chairman David Ruder wanted but Mr. Breeden does n't . </s>
<s> Mr. Brady and senators agreed to have their staffs meet within the next week to start fine-tuning the bill . </s>
