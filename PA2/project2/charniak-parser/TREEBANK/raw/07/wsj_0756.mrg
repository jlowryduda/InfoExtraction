<s> As the Soviet Union grapples with its worsening economy , leading reformers have drawn up a blueprint for change designed to push the nation much closer to a free-market system . </s>
<s> The proposals go far beyond the current and rather confused policies of perestroika , Mikhail Gorbachev 's restructuring of the economy . </s>
<s> They lay out a clear timetable and methodology for liberalizing the system of setting prices , breaking up huge industrial monopolies and putting unprofitable state-owned companies out of business . </s>
<s> They also address such taboo subjects as the likelihood of unemployment and high inflation , and recommend ways to soften the social consequences . </s>
<s> While many solutions to the nation 's economic troubles are being discussed , the blueprint is attracting widespread attention here because of its comprehensiveness and presumed high-level authorship . </s>
<s> Although it was published unsigned in the latest edition of the weekly Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta , Soviet sources say the article was written by Leonid Abalkin and a small group of colleagues . </s>
<s> Mr. Abalkin , head of the Academy of Science 's Institute of Economics , was recently appointed deputy chairman of the Soviet government and head of a state commission on economic reform . </s>
<s> `` It 's clearly a manifesto for the next stage of perestroika , '' said one analyst . </s>
<s> The economic ideas in the document are much bolder than current policies . </s>
<s> For example , the proposed overhaul of prices -- an extremely sensitive political topic -- is far more precise than the vague plans announced by Mr. Gorbachev in 1987 and later dropped . </s>
<s> But the proposals also display political savvy , couching some of the most controversial ideas in cautious language so as not to alienate powerful conservatives in the government who stand to lose out if they are implemented . </s>
<s> Seeking a middle path between opponents of change and radicals who demand overnight solutions , the article advocates what it calls a `` radical-moderate approach . '' </s>
<s> The document is to be discussed at a conference of leading economists late this month , and will probably be presented to the Soviet Parliament for consideration this year . </s>
<s> As policy-makers draw up proposals for the next five-year plan , which starts in 1991 , the blueprint represents a powerful first shot in what is likely to be a fierce battle over economic reform . </s>
<s> The authors make a gloomy assessment of the economy and concede that `` quick and easy paths to success simply do n't exist . '' </s>
<s> Instead , they map out a strategy in several phases from now until 1995 . </s>
<s> Most of the measures would probably only start to have an effect on beleaguered Soviet consumers in two to three years at the earliest . </s>
<s> The key steps advocated include : -- PROPERTY . </s>
<s> Rigid ideological restrictions on property ownership should be abandoned . </s>
<s> The document proposes breaking up the monolithic system of state-owned enterprises and farms and allowing a big private sector to flourish , helped by tough anti-monopoly legislation . </s>
<s> The economy would be thrown open to numerous types of ownership between now and 1992 , including factories leased by workers or owned by shareholders , cooperatives and joint ventures . </s>
<s> Some forms of private property would be sanctioned . </s>
<s> Such moves would greatly reduce the power of government ministries , who now jealously guard their turf and are seen as one of the major obstacles blocking economic reform . </s>
<s> -- FINANCES . </s>
<s> Emergency measures would be introduced to ease the country 's financial crisis , notably its $ 200 billion budget deficit . </s>
<s> By the end of next year , all loss-making state enterprises would be put out of business or handed over to workers who would buy or lease them or turn them into cooperatives . </s>
<s> Similar steps would be taken to liquidate unprofitable state and collective farms by the end of 1991 . </s>
<s> A unified system of taxation should be introduced rapidly . </s>
<s> To mop up some of the 300 billion rubles in circulation , the government should encourage home ownership , including issuing bonds that guarantee holders the right to purchase an apartment . </s>
<s> -- LABOR . </s>
<s> A genuine market for labor and wages would replace the present rigid , centralized system . </s>
<s> Departing from decades of Soviet dogma , the new system would lead to big differences in pay between workers and almost certainly to unemployment . </s>
<s> To cushion the blows , the government would introduce a minimum wage and unemployment benefits . </s>
<s> -- PRICES . </s>
<s> The entire system of centrally set prices would be overhauled , and free-market prices introduced for most wholesale trade and some retail trade . </s>
<s> Consumers would still be able to buy some food and household goods at subsidized prices , but luxury and imported items , including food , would be sold at market prices . </s>
<s> Wholesale prices would be divided into three categories : raw materials sold at fixed prices close to world levels ; government-set procurement prices for a small number of key products ; and free prices for everything else to be determined by contracts between suppliers and purchasers . </s>
<s> Inflation-adjusted social benefits would ensure that the poor and elderly do n't suffer unduly . </s>
<s> -- FOREIGN TRADE . </s>
<s> The current liberalization and decentralization of foreign trade would be taken much further . </s>
<s> Soviet companies would face fewer obstacles for exports and could even invest their hard currency abroad . </s>
<s> Foreigners would receive greater incentives to invest in the U.S.S.R. </s>
<s> Alongside the current non-convertible ruble , a second currency would be introduced that could be freely exchanged for dollars and other Western currencies . </s>
<s> A domestic foreign exchange market would be set up as part of an overhaul of the nation 's banking system . </s>
<s> The blueprint is at its vaguest when referring to the fate of the two powerful economic institutions that seem likely to oppose such sweeping plans : the State Planning Committee , known as Gosplan , and the State Committee for Material Supply , or Gossnab . </s>
<s> But it hints strongly that both organizations would increasingly lose their clout as the changes , particularly the introduction of wholesale trade and the breakup of state monopolies , take effect . </s>
