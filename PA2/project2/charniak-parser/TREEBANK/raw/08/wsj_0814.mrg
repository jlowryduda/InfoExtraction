<s> In search of buyers for upscale department-store chains such as Bloomingdale 's and Saks Fifth Avenue , investment bankers are turning to -- who else ? The Japanese . </s>
<s> But so far Japan 's cash-rich retailers are proving to be cautious shoppers . </s>
<s> `` We have the money to buy . </s>
<s> But operating a U.S. department-store chain would be very difficult , '' says Motoyuki Homma , managing director of the international division at Mitsukoshi Ltd. , one of Japan 's leading department stores . </s>
<s> Japanese retail executives say the main reason they are reluctant to jump into the fray in the U.S. is that -- unlike manufacturing -- retailing is extremely sensitive to local cultures and life styles . </s>
<s> The Japanese have watched the Europeans and Canadians stumble in the U.S. market , and they fret that business practices that have won them huge profits at home wo n't translate into success in the U.S. . </s>
<s> Japanese department stores are also wary of attracting negative publicity . </s>
<s> After Sony Corp. 's recent headline-grabbing acquisition of Columbia Pictures , many say it makes good political sense to lie low . </s>
<s> `` It 's a question of timing , '' says Mayumi Takayama , managing director of international operations at Isetan Co. , a Tokyo department store . </s>
<s> Still , for those with a long-term eye on the vast U.S. retail market , this is a tempting time to look for bargains . </s>
<s> Britain 's B.A.T Industries PLC is trying to unwind its U.S. retailing operations , which include such well-known stores as Saks Fifth Avenue , Marshall Field 's , Breuners and Ivey 's . </s>
<s> And debt-ridden Campeau Corp. of Toronto is giving up the 17-store Bloomingdale 's group . </s>
<s> `` Every department store in Japan is taking a look , '' says Mike Allen , a retail analyst at Barclay 's de Zoete Wedd Securities -LRB- Japan -RRB- Ltd . </s>
<s> Mr. Allen , however , does n't think that Japan is about to embark on a major buying binge . </s>
<s> Nonetheless , speculation heated up yesterday when Tokyu Department Store Co. confirmed a report in Nihon Keizai Shimbun , Japan 's leading business daily , that Tokyu is talking with Campeau about buying Bloomingdale 's . </s>
<s> Tokyu , however , said no agreement had been reached . </s>
<s> Nor is Tokyu the only Japanese retailer interested in Bloomingdale 's , which bankers in Tokyo estimate could cost between $ 1 billion and $ 1.5 billion . </s>
<s> Seven Japanese department-store groups were approached by investment bankers representing Bloomingdale 's chairman , Marvin Traub , and more than half are seeking additional information on the group , bankers say . </s>
<s> What Mr. Traub is hoping to put together , investment bankers say , is a management-led group to buy the New York department-store group that he heads from Campeau 's Federated Department Stores subsidiary . </s>
<s> Federated ran into a cash crunch after it was acquired last year by Campeau , which relied heavily on debt to finance the transaction . </s>
<s> Paying off that debt put such a squeeze on Campeau and its stores that Federated decided to sell off the jewels of its retailing empire , including Bloomingdale 's . </s>
<s> Hoping to avoid another takeover , Mr. Traub retained Blackstone Group and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. to help him find partners for a management-led buy-out . </s>
<s> Ideally , investment bankers say , he wants to get backing from a Japanese department store and a European department store to forge a global retailing network . </s>
<s> `` When you look at the economics , Traub needs a Japanese and a European partner to make it work , '' says one investment banker who follows the retail industry . </s>
<s> `` Looking only at a narrow American strategy is n't where it 's at . '' </s>
<s> Persuading tradition-bound Japanese retailers to get involved in the turmoils of the U.S. retailing industry is n't likely to be so easy , analysts say . </s>
<s> Up until now , most stores have followed the same basic overseas strategy : </s>
<s> First they set up overseas merchandising offices to import items and track new fashion trends . </s>
<s> Then they opened small gift shops mostly aimed at Japanese tourists . </s>
<s> Reluctant to advance further on their own , some stores have settled for tie-ups with famous specialty shops . </s>
<s> Last March , Isetan invested 1.5 billion yen -LRB- $ 10.6 million -RRB- in a venture with Barney 's Inc. , an up-scale New York specialty clothier . </s>
<s> The first Barney 's shop is scheduled to open in Japan next year . </s>
<s> And Mitsukoshi recently increased its equity stake in Tiffany & Co. to 13 % . </s>
<s> Through the longstanding relationship between the two companies , Mitsukoshi has opened 22 Tiffany shops in its stores and arcades in Japan . </s>
<s> Plans are under way to open a Tiffany 's in Hawaii to cater to Japanese tourists ; it will be run mostly by Mitsukoshi . </s>
<s> Some industry observers say that Mitsukoshi 's classy image makes it a possible match for Saks Fifth Avenue . </s>
<s> Company officials say they are studying various proposals but wo n't discuss details . </s>
<s> Takashimaya Co. , Japan 's oldest department store , is another name that keeps popping up as a potential fit with Saks . </s>
<s> Eiji Nakazato , a Takashimaya general manager , admits that his company 's image is similar to Saks 's and that there is some interest in the idea . </s>
<s> But he stops there . </s>
<s> `` We 'd like to do business in America , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` But it looks tough . '' </s>
