<s> Cie. de Navigation Mixte Chairman Marc Fournier said his board unanimously rejected as too low the $ 1.77 billion bid by Cie. Financiere de Paribas to bring its stake in Navigation Mixte to 66.7 % . </s>
<s> At a news conference , Mr. Fournier accused Paribas of planning to pay for the takeover by selling parts of the company , whose interests include insurance , banking , tuna canning , sugar and orange juice . </s>
<s> The chairman said his board members , including representatives of West German insurance giant Allianz AG and French banks Credit Lyonnais and Societe Generale , hold nearly 50 % of Navigation Mixte 's capital . </s>
<s> Mr. Fournier said that as Navigation Mixte chairman , he is prohibited by takeover regulations from organizing his own defense or doing anything besides managing current company business . </s>
<s> But sources said he will be urging his allies to boost their stakes in Navigation Mixte , which is being traded in London and is to resume trading in Paris Tuesday . </s>
<s> At the same time , he is expected to seek legal and regulatory means of blocking or delaying Paribas 's bid . </s>
<s> For the moment , the sources said , he has decided against seeking a white knight or organizing a counterbid for Paribas . </s>
<s> Mr. Fournier said Navigation Mixte 's 1989 unconsolidated , or parent-company , profit is likely to be 4.7 billion francs -LRB- $ 754.4 million -RRB- , up from 633.8 million francs last year . </s>
<s> That is due mostly to payments from Allianz for most of the 50 % stake it has agreed to acquire in Navigation Mixte 's insurance business . </s>
<s> Mr. Fournier said the exceptional gain would mean nearly twice as high a dividend this year as last . </s>
<s> If holders avoid tendering to Paribas , he added , they can expect strong dividends again next year . </s>
<s> Analysts noted that over the past 20 years , Mr. Fournier has built his company through astute stock-market activity and has warded off at least three takeover attempts . </s>
<s> This time , however , some analysts think he could face a real battle . </s>
<s> `` Without some unexpected `` coup de theatre '' , I do n't see what will block the Paribas bid , '' said Philippe de Cholet , analyst at the brokerage Cholet-Dupont & Cie . </s>
<s> Mr. de Cholet said Mr. Fournier 's biggest hope was to somehow persuade regulatory authorities to block the bid . </s>
<s> Paribas still needs the go-ahead from the Commission des Operations de Bourse , a government regulatory agency , but analysts said that is considered likely . </s>
<s> Mr. Fournier also noted that Navigation Mixte joined Paribas 's core of shareholders when Paribas was denationalized in 1987 , and said it now holds just under 5 % of Paribas 's shares . </s>
<s> Once he realized that Paribas 's intentions were n't friendly , he said , but before the bid was launched , he sought approval to boost his Paribas stake above 10 % . </s>
<s> The petition is still pending , but Mr. Fournier downplayed the likelihood of his organizing a takeover bid of his own for the much-larger Paribas . </s>
<s> One big question now is the likely role of Mr. Fournier 's allies . </s>
<s> Mr. Fournier said the large institutions that hold nearly 50 % of Navigation Mixte 's capital all strongly support him , but some analysts said they are n't so sure . </s>
<s> Allianz , for example , has said in official comments so far that it will remain neutral . </s>
<s> Paribas is Allianz 's lead French bank . </s>
<s> Paribas said Monday that it intends to bid to boost its stake in Navigation Mixte to 66.7 % , from the 18.7 % it already owns . </s>
<s> The purchase of the additional 48 % stake is expected to cost more than 11 billion francs -LRB- $ 1.77 billion -RRB- . </s>
<s> Paribas says it will offer 1,850 francs -LRB- $ 296.95 -RRB- each for Navigation Mixte shares that enjoy full dividend rights , and 1,800 francs each for a block of shares issued July 1 , which will receive only partial dividends this year . </s>
<s> Alternatively , it is to offer three Paribas shares for one Navigation Mixte share . </s>
<s> The Paribas offer values Navigation Mixte at about 23 billion francs , depending on how many of Navigation Mixte 's warrants are converted into shares during the takeover battle . </s>
