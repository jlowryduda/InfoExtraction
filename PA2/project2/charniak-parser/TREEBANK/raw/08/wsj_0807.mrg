<s> Black & Decker Corp. said it agreed to sell its Bostik chemical adhesives unit to Orkem S.A. , a French chemical company , for $ 345 million . </s>
<s> Bostik is the first Emhart Corp. unit to be sold as part of the power-tool manufacturer 's effort to reduce debt and consolidate operations after it acquired Emhart earlier this year . </s>
<s> Black & Decker said it plans to put other Emhart units on the block in the future , with the goal of raising $ 1 billion in net proceeds . </s>
<s> Black & Decker rescued Emhart from the takeover bid of Topper Limited Partnership last March by agreeing to acquire the maker of door locks and gardening tools for about $ 2.8 billion . </s>
<s> The move significantly expanded Black & Decker 's product line , but also significantly increased its debt load . </s>
<s> The acquisition boosted Black & Decker 's ratio of debt to total capital to more than 80 % . </s>
<s> Company officials have said they plan to reduce that ratio to less than 50 % over the next 2 1\/2 years . </s>
<s> Earlier this year , Black & Decker put three Emhart businesses on the auction block : the information and electronics segment , the Dynapert electrical assembly business and Mallory Capacitors . </s>
<s> The three units had combined 1988 sales of about $ 904 million . </s>

<s> In addition , Black & Decker had said it would sell two other undisclosed Emhart operations if it received the right price . </s>
<s> Bostic is one of the previously unnamed units , and the first of the five to be sold . </s>

<s> `` Our divestiture program is on schedule , and we remain confident that we will achieve our stated goal of over $ 1 billion in net proceeds , '' said Nolan D. Archibald , Black & Decker 's president and chief executive officer , in a statement . </s>
