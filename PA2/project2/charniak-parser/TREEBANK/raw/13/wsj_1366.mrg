<s> It was the kind of snubbing rarely seen within the Congress , let alone within the same party . </s>
<s> Sen. Alan Cranston trekked over to the House side of Capitol Hill a few days ago and volunteered his testimony to fellow Democrat Rep. Henry Gonzalez . </s>
<s> It was offered as an expression of cooperation to Mr. Gonzalez , who is investigating the $ 2.5 billion failure of Lincoln Savings & Loan Association . </s>
<s> But instead of thanks , Sen. Cranston was treated with cool formality . </s>
<s> `` Every witness receives a formal subpoena , '' Rep. Gonzalez told him . </s>
<s> Seldom have House hearings caused so much apprehension in the Senate , where California Sen. Cranston and four other senators were already writhing in the glare of unfavorable publicity over the alleged looting of Lincoln by their friend and political benefactor , Charles Keating Jr. , principal stockholder of Lincoln 's parent company , American Continental Corp. of Phoenix , Ariz . </s>
<s> At the first day of the House Banking Committee 's hearings last week , William Seidman , chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp. , the federal agency created to sell sick thrifts , said the agency is investigating whether Lincoln made illegal political contributions . </s>
<s> Mr. Keating arranged nearly $ 1 million in donations to Sen. Cranston and his various political causes , and hundreds of thousands more to other lawmakers . </s>
<s> Future witnesses include a former federal S&L regulator who has accused the five senators of attempting to `` subvert '' the regulatory process by intervening on behalf of Mr. Keating . </s>
<s> Unlike many lawmakers , Chairman Gonzalez says he considers intervening with regulators to be improper . </s>
<s> `` When you reach a point where a policy-making body is trying to shape administrative decisions , then that 's a no-no in my book , '' the Texas lawmaker says . </s>
<s> And he has attached himself to the Lincoln story tenaciously . </s>
<s> `` Unless the questions are answered , I will keep on going . '' </s>
<s> Lawmakers often are reluctant to embarrass colleagues , even those of opposing political parties . </s>
<s> In the recent Housing and Urban Development Department scandal , for example , Rep. Thomas Lantos , the California Democrat who led the hearings , tiptoed through embarrassing disclosures about HUD grants secured by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato , a New York Republican . </s>
<s> But Chairman Gonzalez is a genuine maverick . </s>
<s> He comes from the same political line as Wright Patman , a bank-baiting Texas populist who chaired the Banking Committee until 1974 . </s>
<s> Mr. Gonzalez is also a stickler for ethical standards who refuses to accept honorariums and who believes in conducting official business in the open . </s>
<s> Early in his political career , as a city councilman in San Antonio , he walked out of a meeting when political supporters asked that the police chief be replaced , denouncing the closed-door affair publicly as a `` bat-roost meeting . '' </s>
<s> The immediate target of Rep. Gonzalez 's inquiry is Danny Wall , chairman of the Office of Thrift Supervision . </s>
<s> As the principal regulator of the thrift industry , Mr. Wall delayed seizing Lincoln S&L for more than two years after his staff told him that the California thrift was insolvent and that potential losses to taxpayers were growing rapidly . </s>
<s> Rep. Gonzalez seems primed to lash out at Mr. Wall when hearings resume Thursday with testimony by two federal regulators from San Francisco , William Black and Mike Patriarca . </s>
<s> Mr. Wall relieved them of responsibility for supervising Lincoln in 1988 . </s>
<s> Mr. Gonzalez expressed concern over a report that the two had been summoned to Washington by Mr. Wall last week to discuss their testimony in advance . </s>
<s> `` I think he is trying to improperly influence a witness , and by God I 'm not going to tolerate it , '' he says . </s>
<s> Mr. Wall , however , is a self-proclaimed `` child of the Senate '' and former staff director of its Banking Committee . </s>
<s> An inquiry into his handling of Lincoln S&L inevitably will drag in Sen. Cranston and the four others , Sens. Dennis DeConcini -LRB- D. , Ariz. -RRB- , John McCain -LRB- R. , Ariz. -RRB- , John Glenn -LRB- D. , Ohio -RRB- and Donald Riegle -LRB- D. , Mich . -RRB- . </s>
<s> They all attended a meeting in April 1987 questioning why a federal audit of Lincoln S&L had dragged on for two years . </s>
<s> `` I 'm certain that in the course of the hearings the names -LCB- of the senators -RCB- will be brought out , '' Mr. Gonzalez says . </s>
<s> This is raising eyebrows . </s>
<s> `` When I first got a glimpse at the witness list , I could n't believe that they were going to go ahead and do this , '' says Michael Waldman , director of Congress Watch , a consumer group . </s>
<s> `` There are some witnesses who will be forced to testify about their meetings with senators . '' </s>
<s> And a Democratic aide to a Banking Committee member remarks , `` I too am astounded by it , because Gonzalez has certainly placed a lot of Democratic senators in a very bad position . '' </s>
<s> All the senators say they merely were trying to ensure fairness for a constituent . </s>
<s> Mr. Keating lives in Phoenix , and the California thrift 's parent is an Ohio-chartered corporation with holdings in Michigan . </s>
<s> Chairman Gonzalez expresses sympathy for Sen. Riegle , his counterpart as chairman of the Senate Banking Committee . </s>
<s> `` He 's wise , he 's good and I know he 's an honest man , '' the Texan says . </s>
<s> But at the same time , Mr. Gonzalez has n't forgotten a confrontation over Mr. Wall during House-Senate negotiations over S&L bailout legislation during the summer . </s>
<s> The Senate negotiators included Sens. Cranston and Riegle and Mr. Wall 's principal sponsor , Republican Sen. Jake Garn of Utah . </s>
<s> They were willing to trade important provisions in the bailout legislation to preserve Mr. Wall 's job and to avoid a reconfirmation hearing in which he would be called upon to testify about Lincoln S&L . </s>
<s> Most importantly , the Senate traded away the Bush administration 's controversial plan to finance the bailout , which was partly reinstated later . </s>
<s> At the time , Mr. Gonzalez said several senators told him that they `` could get some roadblocks out of the way if there could be some understanding on Garn 's insistence on Wall . '' </s>
<s> Now Mr. Gonzalez is holding the equivalent of reconfirmation hearings anyway , under the guise of the Lincoln investigation . </s>
<s> `` In a way , that 's what this is , '' Mr. Gonzalez concedes . </s>
<s> Even some House Banking Committee members could suffer from the fallout . </s>
<s> Mr. Keating raised $ 20,000 for Rep. Doug Barnard 's 1986 re-election campaign while the Georgia Democrat was taking his side against regulators who wanted to curb risky investments and wholesale deposit brokering . </s>
<s> He recently voted `` present '' when the committee authorized a subpoena to compel Mr. Keating to testify , then changed his vote to yes . </s>
<s> But the chairman 's supporters have the upper hand as federal regulators press a $ 1.1 billion fraud suit against Mr. Keating and others . </s>
<s> Rep. Jim Leach -LRB- R. , Iowa -RRB- says the Lincoln S&L affair is `` the biggest bank heist in history , '' and adds : `` The great question that remains to be resolved is whether we have a congressional Watergate in the making . '' </s>
<s> A witness set to testify on Thursday was quoted in a news report over the weekend as saying Lincoln `` laundered '' campaign contributions illegally . </s>
<s> But the witness , William Crawford , California 's chief state thrift regulator , denies saying that . </s>
<s> `` I do n't know whether it was done properly or not , because I 'm not a lawyer , '' he said in a telephone interview yesterday . </s>
<s> But he said he is prepared to testify that executives of Lincoln and its parent corporation got unusually high salaries and frequent calls directing them to make specific contributions . </s>
<s> The committee also has summoned Mr. Wall 's predecessor , Edwin Gray . </s>
<s> He has characterized the five senators ' roles as `` tantamount to an attempt to subvert the ... regulatory process , '' and he is n't expected to back down even though the five senators have disputed his account of a 1987 meeting . </s>
<s> So the senators must brace themselves . </s>
<s> Sen. Cranston , as he returned to the capital last week from a one-day trip to inspect earthquake damage in San Francisco , sighed to an aide : `` Well , back to Keatingland . </s>
