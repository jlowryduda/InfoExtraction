<s> Yet another political scandal is racking Japan . </s>
<s> But this time it 's hurting opposition as well as ruling-party members . </s>
<s> And as it unfolds , it 's revealing some of the more tangled and seamier aspects of Japanese society . </s>
<s> Already , ruling Liberal Democratic Party demands that opposition members testify under oath in parliament have stalled one budget committee session and forced the committee to plan a special two-day investigation at the end of the month . </s>
<s> But the scandal itself is so convoluted that ruling-party members are divided between those who want to pursue the matter in hope of undermining the opposition and those who favor leaving well enough alone . </s>
<s> `` The opposition can be the most hurt because everyone already figures the LDP is that kind of beast , '' says Shigezo Hayasaka , former aide to LDP kingmaker Kakuei Tanaka and now an independent analyst . </s>
<s> But , he adds , `` We ca n't tell where it will go at all because we 're still in the middle of it . '' </s>
<s> This time , the scandal centers on donations made by the not-quite-mainstream pachinko parlor industry . </s>
<s> Pachinko , a kind of pinball , is Japan 's favorite form of legal gambling . </s>
<s> The donations so far appear to be small , especially compared with the huge sums that changed hands in the Recruit Co . influence-peddling scandal that plagued the ruling party last year . </s>
<s> But the implications could be great . </s>
<s> Pachinko is slightly on the shady side , often linked to the lower ranks of Japan 's underworld and regularly at the top of annual lists of tax evaders . </s>
<s> Recently the industry has faced the threat of new restrictions , and political donations may have been made with the intent to bribe . </s>
<s> Also , about 60 % of pachinko parlor owners are Korean , many of whom maintain close ties with North or South Korean residents ' organizations , and donations by such foreign groups are illegal in Japan . </s>
<s> To many Japanese , pachinko is benign or enticingly unsavory . </s>
<s> Garish neon pachinko marquees blaze from the main streets and narrow alleys of cities and towns across the country . </s>
<s> Devotees pass hours , watching the lights blink and listening to the metal balls ping , as much to gamble as to get a little time to be anonymous , alone with their thoughts . </s>
<s> At 500 yen -LRB- $ 3.60 -RRB- for a handful of balls , pachinko is a common pastime , and has been since it took root as cheap entertainment in the years after World War II . </s>
<s> But the total of all those pinging balls has created an industry with a reported annual income of 13 trillion yen -LRB- almost $ 92 billion -RRB- , or nearly the size of Japan 's vaunted automobile industry . </s>
<s> And because the pachinko industry is regularly at the top of annual lists for tax evasion , some observers estimate the real income could be as much as 20 trillion yen . </s>
<s> If that money were being taxed , it could bring the government a badly needed several trillion yen . </s>
<s> In 1984 , an attempt was made to crack down on the industry with tougher restrictions . </s>
<s> Then , in 1988 , a proposal to keep better track of income by selling prepaid cards for pachinko was fielded in parliament . </s>
<s> The proposal split the industry in two , along the lines of national origin : North Koreans oppose the plan while South Koreans , Japanese and Taiwanese accept it or are neutral . </s>
<s> In August , a conservative weekly magazine reported that a pachinko industry organization donated money to Japan Socialist Party members . </s>
<s> The magazine alleged that in making the donations , the pachinko industry may have been offering bribes to win support in the battle against prepaid cards , or it may have been laundering money back and forth between the JSP and the North Korean residents ' organization , the Chosen Soren . </s>
<s> The Chosen Soren and the JSP immediately denied the report . </s>
<s> And at first , neither the opposition nor the LDP wanted to pursue the issue . </s>
<s> But the press kept it alive ; as with the Recruit scandal , lists began circulating with names of people who had received money . </s>
<s> Within a matter of weeks , less-conservative magazines reported that members of the ruling LDP had received much larger donations from pachinko organizations . </s>
<s> So far , though , there have been no allegations that the contributions the LDP members received amounted to bribes . </s>
<s> Then the two camps upped the ante : Reports that Chosen Soren had donated directly to JSP members were rapidly countered by statements that the South Korean residents ' organization had long been donating directly to LDP members . </s>
<s> The JSP admitted Oct. 13 that its members received about eight million yen from the pachinko organization , and charged LDP members with receiving 125 million yen -LRB- $ 880,000 -RRB- and other opposition parties with taking about 2.5 million yen . </s>
<s> On Friday , the chief cabinet secretary announced that eight cabinet ministers had received five million yen from the industry , including 450,000 yen -LRB- $ 3,175 -RRB- by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu . </s>
<s> No one has alleged that the donations were by themselves illegal . </s>
<s> Direct donations from either of the residents ' organizations would be illegal because the groups are defined as foreign , but both groups deny making direct donations . </s>
<s> They say it s possible some of their members may be donating privately . </s>
<s> The issue is further complicated because although the organizations represent Korean residents , those residents were largely born and raised in Japan and many speak only Japanese . </s>
<s> That they retain Korean citizenship and ties is a reflection of history -- their parents were shipped in as laborers during the decades when Japan occupied Korea before World War II -- and the discrimination that still faces Koreans in Japanese society . </s>
<s> Many Japanese think it only natural that the organizations or their members would donate to politicians , the way many Japanese do , to win favor or support . </s>
<s> Both residents ' organizations admit to receiving some funding from abroad . </s>
<s> But LDP members and supporters of the prepaid card idea tend to speak in innuendo about the JSP 's alleged donations , implying that North Korean money would be more suspect than South Korean because North Korea is communist and South Korea is an ally . </s>
