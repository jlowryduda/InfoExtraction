<s> At age eight , Josephine Baker was sent by her mother to a white woman 's house to do chores in exchange for meals and a place to sleep -- a place in the basement with the coal . </s>
<s> At age 19 , she was a Paris sensation , transformed from unwanted child to international sex symbol in just over a decade . </s>
<s> It is the stuff of dreams , but also of traumas . </s>
<s> Only the bravest spirits survive such roller coasters . </s>
<s> And , for Ms. Baker , the ride was far from over . </s>
<s> Her bare breasts , her dancing , her voice , her beauty and , perhaps most famously , her derriere , were prominent attractions , but courage of a rare sort made her remarkable life possible . </s>
<s> Bricktop , another American black woman who found a measure of fame in Paris , said : `` I do n't think I 've ever known anyone with a less complicated view of life , or whose life was more complicated than Josephine 's . '' </s>
<s> Men were a constant complication . </s>
<s> Baker had lots of them . </s>
<s> But she did n't trust them and did n't reward trust . </s>
<s> As she saw one key love affair , the problem was n't her infidelity , it was his jealousy . </s>
<s> Her appetite for children also was large . </s>
<s> She adopted 12 of assorted races , naming them the Rainbow Tribe , and driving her husband first to despair and then to Argentina . </s>
<s> She made money , but spent more . </s>
<s> Friends pitched in . </s>
<s> Finally , Prince Rainier and Princess Grace saved her with the offer of a house in Monaco . </s>
<s> Another lifelong complication , as Phyllis Rose makes clear in `` Jazz Cleopatra : Josephine Baker in Her Time '' -LRB- Doubleday , 321 pages , $ 22.50 -RRB- , was racism . </s>
<s> Baker had the good luck to arrive in 1925 Paris , where blacks had become exotic . </s>
<s> African art was in vogue and some intellectuals were writing breathlessly of a dawning age to be inspired by blacks . </s>
<s> To be exotic was to be patronized as well as prized , but for the most part Paris was a friendly island in a racist world . </s>
<s> Baker had bitter experience of bigotry from her St. Louis childhood and her days in New York theater , where she was judged too dark for an all-black chorus line -LRB- performing of course for all-white audiences -RRB- . </s>
<s> Paris loved her at first sight . </s>
<s> `` She just wiggled her fanny and all the French fell in love with her , '' sniffed the literary world 's Maria Jolas , not entirely inaccurately . </s>
<s> `` One can hardly overemphasize the importance of her rear end , '' Ms. Rose writes . </s>
<s> Ms. Rose , who teaches literature at Wesleyan University , quickly proceeds to overemphasize , claiming that Baker 's dancing `` had uncovered a new region for desire '' and thereby ignoring centuries of tributes to the callipygous . </s>
<s> `` Jazz Cleopatra '' contains other , more important , false notes that undermine what is , for the most part , a lively account of a life already familiar from earlier works . </s>
<s> It is easy to see why Baker , a free spirit who broke many of the restraints convention places on women , attracts Ms. Rose , the author of `` Parallel Lives , '' a wonderful study of Victorian marriage . </s>
<s> Still , even the title raises questions about the author 's vision of her subject . </s>
<s> Baker 's art was jazz only by the widest stretch of the term . </s>
<s> To find parallels , other than sexual appeal , with Cleopatra , requires an equal stretch . </s>
<s> Baker was 68 years old when she died in Paris , two days after the sold-out opening of her newest show : a movie-like ending to what was a cinematic life . </s>
<s> In fact , Ms. Baker played scenes in Casablanca that could have made it into `` Casablanca . '' </s>
<s> During World War II , her uncomplicated view of life led her to the conclusion that the Nazis were evil and must be resisted , a decision made by only about 2 % of French citizens . </s>
<s> She was devoted to Charles de Gaulle 's cause , accepting great financial sacrifice and considerable risk to become first a spy and then a one-woman USO tour for the forces of Free France . </s>
<s> In Humphrey Bogart 's nightclub , Victor Laszlo leads Free French sympathizers in `` La Marseillaise '' to drown out the Nazis . </s>
<s> The night the Germans occupied all of France , Baker performed in Casablanca . </s>
<s> The Free French wore black arm bands , and when she sang `` J'ai deux amours '' they wept . </s>
<s> Ms. Rose is best on the early years and World War II . </s>
<s> In her introduction , Ms. Rose writes that she feels she has much in common with Baker , but as `` Jazz Cleopatra '' goes on , it seems more rushed , as though the author were growing less interested . </s>
<s> It does n't help that sometimes Ms. Rose 's language fails to deliver the effect she appears to want . </s>
<s> One chapter opens : `` World War II was not one of France 's glorious moments . '' </s>
<s> Elsewhere , in an attempt to explain without stating it plainly that Baker had a large gay following later in her career when she was an overdressed singer rather than underdressed dancer , Ms. Rose writes : `` She was a female impersonator who happened to be a woman . '' </s>
<s> One devoted fan who fell under Baker 's spell in 1963 and began collecting Baker memorabilia was Bryan Hammond . </s>
<s> In `` Josephine Baker '' -LRB- Jonathan Cape , 304 pages , $ 35 -RRB- , which was published in Britain last year and distributed in the U.S. this month , Mr. Hammond has used his collection to produce an album of photographs and drawings of the star . </s>
<s> The text by Patrick O'Connor is a tough read , but the pictures make her magnetism clear and help explain why Ernest Hemingway called Baker `` The most sensational woman anybody ever saw . </s>
<s> Or ever will . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Lescaze is foreign editor of the Journal . </s>
