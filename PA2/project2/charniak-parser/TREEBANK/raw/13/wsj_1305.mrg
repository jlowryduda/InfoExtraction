<s> UAL Corp. 's board quashed any prospects for an immediate revival of a labor-management buy-out , saying United Airlines ' parent should remain independent for now . </s>
<s> As a result , UAL 's chairman , Stephen M. Wolf , pulled out of the buy-out effort to focus on running the company . </s>
<s> The two developments put the acquisition attempt back to square one and leaves the airline with an array of unresolved matters , including an unsettled labor situation and a management scrambling to restore its damaged credibility . </s>
<s> The effort to create the nation 's largest employee-owned company began unraveling Oct. 13 when the labor-management group was unable to obtain financing for its $ 300-a-share , $ 6.79 billion offer . </s>
<s> Just last week it suffered another major setback when British Airways PLC , the largest equity investor in the labor-management bid , withdrew its support . </s>
<s> Takeover stock traders , focusing on the company 's intention to stay independent , took the announcement as bad news . </s>
<s> UAL , which had risen $ 9.875 to $ 178.375 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange on reports of a new bid being prepared by the group , reversed course and plummeted in off-exchange trading after the 5:09 p.m. EDT announcement . </s>
<s> Among the first trades reported by the securities firm of Jefferies & Co. , which makes a market in UAL after the exchange is closed , were 10,000 shares at $ 170 , 6,000 shares at $ 162 , 2,500 at $ 162 , and 10,000 at $ 158 . </s>
<s> The rebound in UAL stock during regular trading hours Monday was its first daily gain after six consecutive losses left the price 41 % below its level before Oct. 13 , the day the group announced the bank financing could n't be obtained for the original deal . </s>
<s> Twelve of UAL 's outside directors met at a five-hour meeting yesterday in Chicago to consider an informal proposal from the buy-out group for a revised bid . </s>
<s> But the board said it was n't interested for now . </s>
<s> That proposal , valued at between $ 225 and $ 240 a share , would have transferred majority ownership to employees while leaving some stock in public hands . </s>
<s> The buy-out group had no firm financing for the plan . </s>
<s> And , with no other offers on the table , the board apparently felt no pressure to act on it . </s>
<s> The directors signaled , however , that they would be willing to consider future offers or take some other action to maximize shareholder value , saying they would continue to explore `` all strategic and financial alternatives . '' </s>
<s> But it was clear that for the time being , the board wants the company to return to normalcy . </s>
<s> The board said it concluded that `` the welfare of the company , its shareholders , its employees and the broader public ... can best be enhanced by continued development of UAL as a strong , viable , independent company . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Wolf urged all employees to `` now turn their full attention '' to operating the airline . </s>
<s> He also vowed to `` make every effort to nurture ... a constructive new relationship that has been forged with participating employee groups . '' </s>
<s> But Mr. Wolf faces a monumental task in pulling the company back together again . </s>
<s> Labor problems top the list . </s>
<s> For a brief time , the buy-out effort seemed to solve his problems with United 's pilot union . </s>
<s> In return for an ownership stake in the company , the pilots were willing to agree to a seven-year contract that included a no-strike clause and significant wage concessions and productivity gains the union previously resisted . </s>
<s> That contract was tied to the success of the buy-out . </s>
<s> As a `` good-will measure , '' the pilots had been working four extra hours a month and had agreed to fly UAL 's two new Boeing 747-400 aircraft . </s>
<s> It 's uncertain if the pilots will continue to do so without a contract settlement . </s>
<s> The union said late last night that it is still committed to majority employee ownership and that the labor disputes that faced the company prior to the buy-out effort `` still need to be addressed . '' </s>
<s> The buy-out effort also worsened already-strained relations between United 's pilot and machinist unions . </s>
<s> The machinists ' criticisms of the labor-management bid and their threats of a strike unless they received substantial wage increases this year helped cool banks ' interest in financing the transaction . </s>
<s> The machinists previously had shown themselves to be an ally to Mr. Wolf , but he lost much of his credibility with that group when he teamed up with the pilot union . </s>
<s> The machinists criticized the terms Mr. Wolf and management received in the buy-out . </s>
<s> They paid $ 15 million for a 1 % stake and received an additional 9 % of the company at no additional cost . </s>
<s> His credibility is also on the line in the investment community . </s>
<s> Until the collapse of this bid , Mr. Wolf was regarded as one of the nation 's savviest airline executives after engineering turnarounds of Tiger International Inc. and Republic Airlines . </s>
<s> But he and his chief financial officer , John Pope , sowed some of the seeds for the deal 's failure by insisting banks accept low financing fees and interest rates , while they invested in the transaction only a small fraction of the $ 114.3 million they stood to gain from sale of their UAL stock and options . </s>
<s> The board 's actions leave takeover stock traders nursing some $ 700 million in losses and eager to respond to anyone who might make a new offer . </s>
<s> It also inevitably leaves a residue of shareholder lawsuits . </s>
<s> Arbitragers said they were disappointed the company did n't announce some recapitalization or other plan to maximize value . </s>
<s> One takeover expert noted that arbitragers could force a recapitalization through the written consent process under which holders may oust the board by a majority vote . </s>
<s> The machinists union has suggested it may propose a recapitalization that includes a special dividend for holders and a minority ownership stake for employees . </s>
<s> Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis , whose $ 240-a-share offer for UAL in August triggered a bidding war , says he remains interested in the airline . </s>
<s> However , he is restricted from making certain hostile moves by an agreement he signed to obtain confidential UAL data . </s>
<s> Essentially , he ca n't make any hostile moves unless he makes a tender offer at least $ 300 a share . </s>
