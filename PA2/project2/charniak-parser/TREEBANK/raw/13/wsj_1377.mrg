<s> SMYRNA , Ga. -- </s>
<s> The auto-dealer strip in this booming suburb runs nearly five miles along Cobb Parkway , stretching from the Perimeter highway that circles Atlanta to the `` Big Chicken , '' a pullet-roofed fast-food restaurant and local landmark . </s>
<s> Twenty years ago , in the infancy of suburban sprawl , just a handful of dealerships were here . </s>
<s> Now there are 23 . </s>
<s> Alongside such long-familiar names as Chevrolet , Ford and Dodge are nameplates that did n't exist until three years ago : Acura , Sterling , Hyundai . </s>
<s> Under construction is the strip 's 24th showroom , the future home of Lexus , a luxury marque launched by Toyota Motor Corp. just two months ago . </s>
<s> The 1980s have spawned an explosion of consumer choice in America , in everything from phone companies to colas . </s>
<s> And especially , as the Cobb Parkway strip attests , in cars . </s>
<s> Americans now can choose among 572 different models of cars , vans and trucks , up from just 408 when the decade began , according to Automotive News , a trade publication . </s>
<s> For car marketers , it has become a much tougher battle to keep loyal customers from defecting to one of the new makes on the block . </s>
<s> For American car buyers , the proliferation of choice is both liberating and confusing . </s>
<s> Malcolm MacDougall , vice chairman of the Jordan , McGrath , Case & Taylor advertising agency in New York , calls the proliferation `` nameplate mania . '' </s>
<s> He says the number of automobile choices is causing stress among consumers today , and that people will simply ignore new models that lack a well-defined image . </s>
<s> `` The winners , '' he predicts , `` will be brands from car makers that have traditionally been associated with quality and value . '' </s>
<s> He says it 's important for a new make to be as distinctive as possible while still retaining links to the parent company 's quality image . </s>
<s> He applauds Toyota and Nissan Motor Co. for creating separate divisions for their new luxury models , rather than simply adding more nameplates to their standard car lines . </s>
<s> Some auto executives believe the benefits of more choice outweigh the drawbacks . </s>
<s> `` There 's more noise out there , and the consumer may have to work harder to cut through it , '' says Vincent P. Barabba , executive director of market research and planning at General Motors Corp . </s>
<s> `` But the reward is that there 's less need to make tradeoffs '' in choosing one 's wheels . </s>
<s> Jeanene Page , of North Salt Lake City , Utah , likes the broader selection . </s>
<s> She wants something big , and already has looked at the Chrysler New Yorker and Lincoln Town Car . </s>
<s> Now , the 55-year-old car shopper is zeroing in on a full-sized van , figuring that it 's just the thing to haul nine grandchildren and pull a boat at the same time . </s>
<s> `` That seems to be what all my friends are using to take the grandkids to the lake , '' she says . </s>
<s> Market segmentation in cars is n't new , but it 's far more extensive than when Alfred P. Sloan Jr. conceived the idea 50 years ago . </s>
<s> The legendary GM chairman declared that his company would make `` a car for every purse and purpose . '' </s>
<s> Now there are many cars for every purse and purpose . </s>
<s> Just four years ago , GM planners divided the combined car and truck market into seven segments . </s>
<s> Today , they identify 19 distinct segments for cars , and another 11 for trucks and vans . </s>
<s> The number of makes has mushroomed because the U.S. is the world 's biggest and richest market for automobiles ; virtually every auto maker wants to sell here . </s>
<s> For every brand like Renault or Fiat that has been squeezed out , others such as Isuzu , Daihatsu and Mitsubishi have come in . </s>
<s> Detroit tries to counter the foreign invasion with new brands of its own . </s>
<s> GM launched the Geo marque this year to sell cars made in partnership with foreign auto makers , and next year GM 's long-awaited Saturn cars will make their debut . </s>
<s> Ford Motor Co. created the Merkur nameplate in 1985 to sell its German-made touring sedans in the U.S. . </s>
<s> But slow sales forced Ford to kill the brand just last week . </s>
<s> When consumers have so many choices , brand loyalty is much harder to maintain . </s>
<s> The Wall Street Journal 's `` American Way of Buying '' survey found that 53 % of today 's car buyers tend to switch brands . </s>
<s> For the survey , Peter D. Hart Research Associates and the Roper Organization each asked about 2,000 U.S. consumers about their buying habits . </s>
<s> Which cars do Americans favor most these days ? </s>
<s> It 's hard to generalize , but age seems to be the best predictor . </s>
<s> Adults under age 30 like sports cars , luxury cars , convertibles and imports far more than their elders do . </s>
<s> Three of every 10 buyers under 30 would prefer to buy a sports car , compared with just 16 % of adults 30 and over , according to the Journal survey . </s>
<s> Young consumers prefer luxury cars by a 37 % to 28 % margin -- even though older buyers , because of their incomes , are more likely to actually purchase a luxury car . </s>
<s> Perhaps most striking , 35 % of households headed by people aged 18 to 44 have at least one foreign car . </s>
<s> That 's true of only 14 % of households headed by someone 60 or older . </s>
<s> Generally , imports appeal most to Americans who live in the West and are well-educated , affluent and , especially , young . </s>
<s> `` For many baby boomers , buying a domestic car is a totally foreign experience , '' says Christopher Cedergren , auto-market analyst with J.D. Power & Co. of Agoura Hills , Calif . </s>
<s> Such preferences persist even though many Americans believe differences between imported and domestic cars are diminishing . </s>
<s> Only 58 % of Americans now believe that foreign cars get better gas mileage than domestic models , the Journal survey found , down from 68 % in 1987 . </s>
<s> Some 46 % give foreign cars higher quality ratings , down from 50 % two years ago . </s>
<s> On the other hand , only 42 % say foreign cars are less comfortable than U.S. models , down from 55 % in 1987 . </s>
<s> People in the automotive business disagree over how susceptible younger Americans are to brand switching . </s>
<s> `` Once buying habits are formed , they 're very hard to break , '' declares Thomas Mignanelli , executive vice president for Nissan 's U.S. sales operations . </s>
<s> But out on Cobb Parkway , Ted Negas sees it differently . </s>
<s> `` The competition is so intense that an owner 's loyalty to a dealership or a car is virtually nonexistent , '' says Mr. Negas , vice president of Ed Voyles Oldsmobile , one of the first dealerships to locate on the strip . </s>
<s> Thus the very fickleness of baby boomers may make it possible to win them back , just as it was possible to lose them . </s>
<s> The battle for customer loyalty is evident along the Cobb Parkway strip . </s>
<s> Ed Voyles Olds recently established a special section in the service department for owners whose cars are less than a year old , so they get quicker service . </s>
<s> Just down the street , Chris Volvo invites serious shoppers to test-drive a new Volvo to any other dealership along the strip , and compare the cars side-by-side . </s>
<s> Manufacturers , too , are stretching further to lure buyers . </s>
<s> GM 's Cadillac division , ignoring Detroit 's long-held maxim that safety does n't sell , is airing television commercials touting its cars ' safety features . </s>
<s> Cadillac may be on to something . </s>
<s> Some 60 % of the survey respondents said they would buy anti-lock brakes even if they carry a medium or high price tag . </s>
<s> More than 50 % felt the same way about air bags . </s>
<s> Both features appealed most to buyers under 45 . </s>
<s> In contrast , dashboard computers , power seats and turbo-charged engines had little appeal . </s>
<s> But even a little appeal has a lot of attraction these days . </s>
<s> GM 's Pontiac division is offering a turbo-charged V-6 engine on its Grand Prix model , even though it expects to sell only about 4,000 cars equipped with that option . </s>
<s> The reason : Items with narrow appeal can be important in a market as fragmented as today 's . </s>
<s> Americans spent more than $ 190 billion on new cars and trucks last year , and just 1 % of that market exceeded Polaroid Co. 's sales of $ 1.86 billion . </s>
<s> `` Even if it 's only 1 % , '' says GM 's Mr. Barabba , `` would you throw away sales the size of Polaroid ? '' </s>
