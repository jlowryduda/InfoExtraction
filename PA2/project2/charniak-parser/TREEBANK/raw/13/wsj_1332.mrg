<s> Westamerica Bancorp. said Richard W. Decker resigned as president and chief executive officer after only a year on the job because of `` differences '' with the board . </s>
<s> The banking company could n't be reached to comment beyond a written announcement . </s>
<s> It did n't specify the nature of the differences , saying only that they related to `` management style '' and `` strategic objectives . '' </s>
<s> Westamerica said Mr. Decker 's posts were assumed by David Payne , Westamerica 's chairman , who at 34 years of age becomes one of the youngest chief executives of a sizable bank in the country . </s>
<s> Mr. Decker is about 45 years old . </s>
<s> Neither Mr. Payne nor Mr. Decker could be reached to comment . </s>
<s> Westamerica has about $ 1.3 billion of assets and is the largest independent bank in northern California . </s>
<s> It controls about 35 % of the affluent Marin County market across the Golden Gate bridge from San Francisco . </s>
<s> Mr. Decker 's resignation surprised many industry officials . </s>
<s> He was brought to the company in September 1988 after 15 years at Los Angeles-based First Interstate Bancorp . </s>
<s> The bank had been suffering in late 1987 from a slew of bad real estate loans made in Arizona . </s>
<s> When he was hired , Mr. Payne lauded Mr. Decker 's `` extraordinary ... skills '' and his `` outstanding reputation as one of the West 's brightest bankers . '' </s>
<s> Though the bank is n't performing as well as some of its competitors in the lucrative California market , its condition has improved since Mr. Decker took over . </s>
<s> For the six months ended June 30 , it earned $ 3.1 million , or 61 cents a share , compared with net income of $ 2.4 million , or 41 cents a share , a year earlier . </s>
<s> Its stock also has risen lately , at least partly because it is considered a possible takeover candidate . </s>
<s> Interstate banking is scheduled to begin in California in 1991 , and larger California banks , such as Wells Fargo & Co. , have been paying fat premiums to buy smaller banks to control markets before any out-of-state banks enter the fray . </s>
<s> In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Westamerica closed at $ 22.25 a share , down 75 cents . </s>
