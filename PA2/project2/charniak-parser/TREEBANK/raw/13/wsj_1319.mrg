<s> In a sign the stock slump has n't quieted Europe 's takeover fever , Cie . Financiere de Paribas said it intends to bid for one of France 's other large financial and industrial holding companies , Cie. de Navigation Mixte . </s>
<s> Paribas said that once it receives the go-ahead from French stock market authorities , it will offer to boost its Navigation Mixte stake to 66.7 % from the current 18.7 % . </s>
<s> Its cash-or-shares bid values Navigation Mixte at about 22.82 billion francs -LRB- $ 3.62 billion -RRB- , making this one of France 's largest-ever attempted takeovers . </s>
<s> The cost of buying the additional 48 % stake would be 10.95 billion francs -LRB- $ 1.74 billion -RRB- . </s>
<s> The move would greatly boost Paribas 's stake in the insurance , transport and food businesses , where Navigation Mixte is strong . </s>
<s> It also would make Paribas a major French ally of West Germany 's Allianz AG insurance group . </s>
<s> Allianz holds a 50 % stake in Navigation Mixte 's insurance interests , acquired three weeks ago . </s>
<s> Those include Rhin et Moselle Vie and Via Assurances . </s>
<s> Long considered a potential takeover target , Navigation Mixte had hoped Allianz would help protect it from raiders . </s>
<s> That idea may have backfired . </s>
<s> Paribas is Allianz 's main French bank , and the Munich-based group said it intends to stay neutral . </s>
<s> Navigation Mixte said it would n't have any comment until its board meets Wednesday . </s>
<s> But Navigation Mixte is loosely held and hard to defend . </s>
<s> `` The defensive options are limited , '' says Philippe Braye , a partner in portfolio management concern France Finance Quatre . </s>
<s> `` Who would bid against Paribas ? '' </s>
<s> If the Paribas bid succeeds , it will be the second time in two months a big French investment banking group has snapped up an insurance group . </s>
<s> Last month , Paribas 's archrival , Cie . Financiere de Suez , won a battle for Groupe Victoire , France 's second-largest private-sector insurer , which itself had just acquired West Germany 's Colonia Versicherung AG . </s>
<s> That complex bid was billed as France 's largest takeover ever -LRB- this one is slightly smaller -RRB- . </s>
<s> Moreover , Suez had just finished winning an even larger battle last year for control of Societe Generale de Belgique . </s>
<s> Paribas officials , once considered France 's toughest bankers , felt abashed at Suez 's success and its rapid growth . </s>
<s> Although Paribas denies it , analysts say the new bid in part simply reflects the continuing rivalry between France 's two largest investment banking groups . </s>
<s> It also reflects the broader pressure on companies in Europe to keep up as the European Community prepares to reduce internal trade barriers by 1992 . </s>
<s> Although Paribas Chairman Michel Francois-Poncet would n't rule out eventually selling all of Navigation Mixte 's insurance operations to Allianz , he stressed the potential for the two groups instead to cooperate . </s>
<s> He also told reporters the acquisition would give Paribas fresh diversity , bringing it properties in food and transport where it has been weak . </s>
<s> Navigation Mixte has investments in a sugar company , a food and canning concern , a bakery and bus and trucking firms , among others . </s>
<s> And Navigation Mixte has a huge hidden attraction . </s>
<s> Payment by Allianz for the insurance interests it has just bought will help swell the French concern 's treasury to an estimated 11 billion francs . </s>
<s> Paribas said it will bid 1,850 francs a share for Navigation Mixte shares that qualify for a full yearly dividend , and 1,800 francs for those created July 1 , which are eligible for partial dividends . </s>
<s> Alternatively , it said it would offer three Paribas shares , themselves eligible for dividends as of next Jan. 1 , for one Navigation Mixte share . </s>
<s> Paribas shares closed down 30 francs at 610 francs , and Navigation Mixte shares were suspended at 1,800 francs pending the outcome of the bid . </s>
<s> Paribas said it would publish details of its bid once authorities clear it . </s>
<s> This is one of the first bids under new takeover rules aimed at encouraging open bids instead of gradual accumulation of large stakes . </s>
<s> Some financial sources said privately that Paribas blundered in failing to move sooner for the insurance and industrial group , bidding only after speculation had pushed up the price . </s>
<s> Mr. Francois-Poncet responded that his group initially intended to take only a minority stake , striking an alliance with current management . </s>
<s> When notoriously independent-minded Navigation Mixte Chairman Marc Fournier rejected Paribas 's offer and began buying Paribas shares in retaliation , Mr. Francois-Poncet said , he felt obliged to bid for control . </s>
<s> He told reporters he had information that Mr. Fournier was preparing to buy as much as 20 % of Paribas , up from less than 5 % currently . </s>
<s> A bid against Paribas could n't be ruled out . </s>
<s> France 's second-largest government-owned insurance company , Assurances Generales de France , has been building its own Navigation Mixte stake , currently thought to be between 8 % and 10 % . </s>
<s> Analysts said they do n't think it is contemplating a takeover , however , and its officials could n't be reached . </s>
