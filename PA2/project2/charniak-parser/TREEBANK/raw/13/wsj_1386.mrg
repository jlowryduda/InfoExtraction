<s> Eastman Kodak Co. , seeking to position itself in the potentially huge high-definition television market , unveiled a converter that can transform conventional motion-picture film into high-definition video . </s>
<s> The move also helps the Rochester , N.Y. , photographic giant ensure that its motion-picture film business -- for which it holds a virtual monopoly , supplying every Hollywood movie company -- is n't made obsolete by the upstart HDTV business . </s>
<s> While the prototype converter is costly , it 's being lauded by the infant HDTV industry as a way of increasing the number of high-quality shows that can be seen on the new medium . </s>
<s> `` The industry has been waiting with bated breath for the machines to come along , '' says David Niles , president of Eleven Twenty Five Productions Inc. , a New York pioneer in high-definition programming . </s>
<s> He notes that industry executives have until now worried that they would face a severe shortage of programs once consumers begin replacing their TV sets with HDTVs . </s>
<s> Japanese electronic giants , such as Sony Corp. and Hitachi Ltd. , have focused almost entirely on HDTV hardware , and virtually ignored software or programs shot in high-definition . </s>
<s> And only a handful of small U.S. companies are engaged in high-definition software development . </s>
<s> It 's estimated that just about 250 hours of HD programming is currently available for airing . </s>
<s> Kodak says its new CCD HDTV converter will help alleviate the problem by allowing programmers and broadcasters to convert movies and television programs shot in 35mm motion-picture film into high-definition video . </s>
<s> Consumers will be able to switch on their HDTV sets and get all the viewing benefits the high-tech medium offers . </s>
<s> Otherwise , they 'd be watching programs that are no different in quality from what they currently view on color TVs . </s>
<s> It would be like `` watching a black and white movie on a color TV set , '' says Malcolm G. Saull , chairman of the film and video department at the Rochester Institute of Technology . </s>
<s> The new converters are `` a critical link between film and the television domain , '' says Joerg D. Agin , vice president and general manager of Kodak 's Motion Picture and Audiovisual Products division . </s>
<s> Kodak wo n't disclose the cost or when its converter will be on the market , but it 's estimated the machine may be available within two years . </s>
<s> A similar machine already on the market , made by Rank Sintel Ltd. , a unit of Rank Organisation , costs about $ 500,000 . </s>
<s> And the potential market is tremendous , industry experts say . </s>
<s> If HDTV takes off in the U.S. , there will be demand for some 4,000 to 5,000 HDTV converters , known in the industry as telecines . </s>
<s> Demand will come first from programming production companies and then from television stations . </s>
<s> `` The converter is head and shoulders above anything else I 've seen , '' says Richard J. Stumpf , vice president - engineering and development at MCA Inc. 's Universal City Studios . </s>
<s> And Mr. Niles , the program producer , contends that Kodak 's move is `` a sound marketing decision . </s>
<s> They ca n't afford to stay out of HDTV . '' </s>
<s> Indeed , the stakes are high . </s>
<s> The U.S. electronics industry estimates that the HDTV market will total about $ 150 billion over the next two decades , with an additional $ 400 billion expected to go for related products . </s>
<s> HDTVs break down images into more than 1,100 lines , compared with 525 for today 's televisions , providing considerably sharper detail . </s>
<s> And the sets are wider , resembling the dimensions of a movie screen . </s>
<s> But the financial rewards are n't expected soon , nor are they guaranteed . </s>
<s> Experts estimate the first sets of HDTVs wo n't be available for another five to 10 years , and will probably retail for more than $ 3,000 each in today 's dollars . </s>
<s> Some critics say they wo n't be quickly embraced by consumers because of the high price . </s>
<s> Nevertheless , Kodak could n't risk letting HDTV turn its motion-picture film business into a dinosaur . </s>
<s> `` Kodak understands HDTV is where everybody is going , '' says RIT 's Mr. Spaull . </s>
