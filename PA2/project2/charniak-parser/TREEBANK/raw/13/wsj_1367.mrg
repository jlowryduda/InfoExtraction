<s> When Anne Volokh and her family immigrated to the U.S. 14 years ago , they started life in Los Angeles with only $ 400 . </s>
<s> They 'd actually left the Soviet Union with $ 480 , but during a stop in Italy Ms. Volokh dropped $ 80 on a black velvet suit . </s>
<s> Not surprisingly , she quickly adapted to the American way . </s>
<s> Three months after she arrived in L.A. she spent $ 120 she did n't have for a hat . </s>
<s> -LRB- `` A turban , '' she specifies , `` though it was n't the time for that 14 years ago . </s>
<s> But I loved turbans . '' -RRB- </s>
<s> Since then she has become wealthy . </s>
<s> Her husband and older son -- a computer prodigy profiled in The Wall Street Journal in 1981 , when he was 13 -- run a software company with expected sales this year of $ 10 million . </s>
<s> Most recently , she has become the publisher of Movieline , a four-year-old Los Angeles magazine that began national distribution last month , with an initial press run of 100,000 copies . </s>
<s> Distributed by the Hearst Corp. 's Eastern News , the glossy publication melds Vanity Fair 's gossipy archness and Premiere 's earnest delving into behind-the-scenes minutiae , with a special emphasis on Tinseltown as fashion trendsetter . </s>
<s> It 's being sold through bookstores , newsstands and some video stores . </s>
<s> Though Ms. Volokh is a small woman , she has an outsized personality and dramatic flair that seem perfectly suited to capitalism as it is practiced in Hollywood . </s>
<s> Certainly life for her has changed considerably since the days in Kiev , when she lived with her parents , her husband and her two sons in a 2 1\/2-room apartment in what she calls `` silent internal immigration , '' dreaming of escape . </s>
<s> Now , for example , she owns 48 hats . </s>
<s> However , she remembers the lean years and recalls with relish wearing her first major American purchase -- that turban 10 years later and having a Los Angeles boutique owner ask her if it was a Chanel . </s>
<s> With obvious satisfaction , she says she told him : `` No darling , I just give it a Chanel look . '' </s>
<s> She keeps track of the rest of her hats by stapling Polaroid snapshots to the outside of each hatbox . </s>
<s> Are the hats merely part of her new L.A. persona , along with the many ultra-thin Capri cigarettes she smokes , the parties she throws for 500 people , the Chekovian feasts she offers guests at her weekend place in Santa Barbara ? </s>
<s> `` No , darling , '' she said recently in her fluent , slightly affected English , during a trip East to promote Movieline 's national expansion . </s>
<s> `` You have to be born with it . </s>
<s> I used to wear hats in Russia , but I had to make them and my dresses . </s>
<s> On the hat side I was n't getting what I wanted . '' </s>
<s> Now 48 years old , Ms. Volokh has definite ideas about what she wants . </s>
<s> At Movieline , she wants `` specific paragraphing , specific tone , a specific attitude -- bright and bold and tongue-in-cheek . '' </s>
<s> In restaurants -LRB- in this case , the Russian Samovar , a New York restaurant operated by and for Soviet emigres -RRB- , she did n't want the chirpy , folkish music bouncing through the room . </s>
<s> `` You people here think this is Russian music , '' she said with disdain , and called over to the waitress : `` Could you turn it off ? '' </s>
<s> That done , Ms. Volokh spoke with rampant eloquence about the many attributes she feels she was born with : an understanding of food , business , Russian culture , human nature , and parties . </s>
<s> `` Parties are rather a state of mind , '' she said , pausing only to taste and pass judgment on the Georgian shashlik -LRB- `` a little well done , but very good '' -RRB- . </s>
<s> `` If you are born to give parties , you give parties . </s>
<s> Even in Russia we managed to give parties . </s>
<s> In Los Angeles , in our lean years , we gave parties . '' </s>
<s> As publisher of a magazine devoted to movies as guideposts for fashion and other fantasies , Ms. Volokh sees her party-giving as an important part of business . </s>
<s> She has thrown extravagant soirees for crowds of people , but prefers more intimate gatherings . </s>
<s> `` At American cocktail parties everyone 's always looking over your shoulder to see who they can talk to next . </s>
<s> I like rather tea , because it is at the end of the day . '' </s>
<s> She serves high Russian tea , at 5 p.m . </s>
<s> `` It 's supposed to be later but I just moved it . </s>
<s> In Los Angeles , it 's important to catch people just after work . '' </s>
<s> She also frequently invites directors , producers , actors , writers and other show business people for `` coffee and clips in the pleasure dome . '' </s>
<s> Guests bring movies on tape , and show their favorite three-to-five minute segments on the screen that unrolls from the ceiling of the Volokhs ' art-nouveau library -LRB- `` the pleasure dome '' -RRB- . </s>
<s> They eat `` sinful and sensual things '' -- and explain their clips . </s>
<s> `` It 's very revealing and soul baring , '' said Ms. Volokh . </s>
<s> The idea for Movieline actually was dreamed up by an old friend of the Volokhs , Boris Krutchensky -LRB- who has the title of co-publisher -RRB- , and Laurie Halpern Smith , now the magazine 's co-editor . </s>
<s> Mr. Krutchensky approached Ms. Volokh five years ago about backing the publication , which started out as a listing guide . </s>
<s> She was interested only if she could guide it editorially as well . </s>
<s> `` Anne does n't believe in blandness , '' said Ms. Smith . </s>
<s> `` She wants things to be exciting . </s>
<s> And she has this inexhaustible energy . </s>
<s> She 'll think of an idea the editorial people think is impossible , then she 'll have us make it work . '' </s>
<s> In fact , Ms. Volokh was n't just a rich lady who needed a hobby . </s>
<s> Back in the Soviet Union she was a respected journalist , writing a weekly column about the national cuisine for Sunday Izvestia . </s>
<s> Those columns -- vivid discussions of the cultural and literary reverberations of food as well as practical advice on how to glamorize dreary Sovietized meals -- became the basis for her erudite and entertaining cookbook , `` The Art of Russian Cuisine , '' brought out in 1983 by Macmillan Publishing Co . </s>
<s> `` I do n't trust people who do n't eat , '' said Ms. Volokh , though she herself stopped eating lunch a few years ago to drop 25 pounds . </s>
<s> `` Look at Dostoevski and Kafka . </s>
<s> No one ever eats in their books and look at them ... . </s>
<s> Tolstoy 's characters eat , Pushkin 's , Gogol 's . '' </s>
<s> In her cookbook , which Macmillan is bringing out in soft cover this month -LRB- with the blini recipe revised so it works -RRB- , she introduces each chapter with appropriate quotations from Russian literature : Pushkin on blini , Goncharov on piroghi . </s>
<s> In life , she offers practical dieting advice : `` Divide your meals into important and unimportant . </s>
<s> In a great restaurant , do n't deprive yourself . </s>
<s> The other meals do n't matter . '' </s>
<s> Amusing as she is , and frivolous as she can seem , this is a serious person with some difficult memories . </s>
<s> She was the child of relative privilege . </s>
<s> Her mother was a translator ; her father was `` the eternal vice director . '' </s>
<s> `` I emigrated to wear better hats , do better parties , '' she said with a giggle . </s>
<s> `` But we should n't leave out political reasons , number one . </s>
<s> You try to maintain your dignity under difficult circumstances . </s>
<s> One can not imagine how you live when you live those double and triple lives . '' </s>
<s> By 1973 , after their second child was born , it had become clear to Ms. Volokh and her husband Vladimir , a computer scientist , that they wanted to leave the U.S.S.R . </s>
<s> Ms. Volokh quit her job , to remove herself from the public eye . </s>
<s> The wait was miserable . </s>
<s> Before granting Ms. Volokh 's parents a visa , the government required her mother to obtain permission from her first husband , whom she had divorced 38 years earlier . </s>
<s> Mr. Volokh was fired from his job , and had to endure hours of organized verbal abuse from his co-workers , accusations of sabotage and counterrevolutionary activities . </s>
<s> The Volokhs were afraid that they 'd end up like a friend of theirs who 'd applied for a visa and waited for 10 years , having been demoted from his profession of theoretical mathematician to shipping clerk . </s>
<s> They did n't . </s>
<s> Their visa came in relatively short order , and they moved to Los Angeles . </s>
<s> Mr. Volokh soon found work in his field , but Ms. Volokh refused the obvious and available occupation - as translator for a Russian who spoke fluent English . </s>
<s> `` That 's always looking back , '' she said . </s>
<s> `` I wanted to be in business . '' </s>
<s> On the way to that goal , she received her first U.S. paycheck for proofreading a book of Polish poetry , attended secretarial school , then went to work for a fund-raising organization . </s>
<s> Soon she was running the office . </s>
<s> When her husband and son founded their computer company , Vesoft , she worked as business manager , bookkeeper and publicist . </s>
<s> Now Movieline is located in the same building as Vesoft . </s>
<s> `` Things work out unexpectedly in life , '' said Ms. Volokh . </s>
<s> `` You never know if you 'll be chosen to be the scapegoat or the lucky one . </s>
<s> We were lucky . </s>
