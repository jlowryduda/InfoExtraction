<s> Out of the mouths of revolutionaries are coming words of moderation . </s>
<s> Here , at a soccer stadium near the black township of Soweto yesterday , were eight leaders of the African National Congress , seven of whom had spent most of their adult lives in prison for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government . </s>
<s> Here were more than 70,000 ANC supporters , gathering for the first ANC rally inside South Africa since the black liberation movement was banned in 1960 . </s>
<s> Here was the state security appartus poised to pounce on any words or acts of provocation , let alone revolution . </s>
<s> But the words that boomed over the loudspeakers bore messages of peace , unity , negotiation and discipline . </s>
<s> `` We stand for peace today and we will stand for peace tomorrow , '' said Walter Sisulu , the ANC 's former secretary general who , along with five of his colleagues , served 26 years in prison before being released two weeks ago . </s>
<s> Some members of the huge crowd shouted `` Viva peace , viva . '' </s>
<s> These are curious times in South African politics . </s>
<s> The government and the ANC , the bitterest of enemies , are engaged in an elaborate mating dance designed to entice each other to the negotiating table . </s>
<s> Pretoria releases the ANC leaders , most of whom were serving life sentences , and allows them to speak freely , hoping that the ANC will abandon its use of violence . </s>
<s> The ANC leaders speak in tones of moderation , emphasizing discipline , hoping the government will be encouraged to take further steps , such as freeing Nelson Mandela , the most prominent ANC figure , and unbanning the organization . </s>
<s> The government of President F.W. de Klerk is using this situation to improve its international image and head off further economic sanctions . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , the many organizations inside the country that back the ANC are taking the opportunity to regain their strength and mobilize their supporters even though the state of emergency , which has severely curtailed black opposition , remains in force . </s>
<s> The result is that the unthinkable and illogical are happening . </s>
<s> Six months ago , government approval for an ANC rally was inconceivable . </s>
<s> Equally inconceivable is that the ANC , given the chance to hold a rally , would extend a hand , albeit warily , to the government . </s>
<s> In a message read out at the rally , exiled ANC President Oliver Tambo , who ca n't legally be quoted in South Africa , said the country was at a crossroads and that Mr. de Klerk `` may yet earn a place among the peacemakers of our country '' if he chooses a `` path of genuine political settlement . '' </s>
<s> Still , this does n't mean that either the government or the ANC is changing stripes -- or that either has moved significantly closer to the other . </s>
<s> The government may ease repression in some areas , but it still keeps a tight grip in others . </s>
<s> For instance , it releases Mr. Sisulu without conditions , yet his son , Zwelakhe , a newspaper editor , is restricted to his home much of the day and is n't allowed to work as a journalist . </s>
<s> The ANC vows to keep up pressure on the government . </s>
<s> Speakers yesterday called on foreign governments to increase sanctions against Pretoria and urged supporters inside the country to continue defying emergency restrictions and racial segregation , known as apartheid . </s>
<s> `` We can not wait on the government to make changes at its own pace , '' Mr. Sisulu said . </s>
<s> Because the ANC remains banned , both the government , which approved the rally , and the organizers , who orchestrated it , denied it was an ANC rally . </s>
<s> They both called it a `` welcome home '' gathering . </s>
<s> Nevertheless , an ANC rally by any other name is still an ANC rally . </s>
<s> The recently released leaders sat high atop a podium in one section of the stadium stands . </s>
<s> Behind them was a huge ANC flag and an even bigger sign that said `` ANC Lives , ANC Leads . '' </s>
<s> Next to them was the red flag of the outlawed South African Communist Party , which has long been an ANC ally . </s>
<s> In the stands , people waved ANC flags , wore ANC T-shirts , sang ANC songs and chanted ANC slogans . </s>
<s> `` Today , '' said Mr. Sisulu , `` the ANC has captured the center stage of political life in South Africa . '' </s>
<s> As a police helicopter circled overhead , Mr. Sisulu repeated the ANC 's demands on the government to create a climate for negotiations : Release all political prisoners unconditionally ; lift all bans and restrictions on individuals and organizations ; remove all troops from the black townships ; end the state of emergency , and cease all political trials and political executions . </s>
<s> If these conditions are met , he said , the ANC would be prepared to discuss suspending its guerrilla activities . </s>
<s> `` There can be no question of us unilaterally abandoning the armed struggle , '' he said . `` </s>
<s> To date , we see no clear indication that the government is serious about negotiations . </s>
<s> All their utterances are vague . '' </s>
<s> Echoing a phrase from Mr. de Klerk , Mr. Sisulu said , `` Let all of us who love this country engage in the task of building a new South Africa . </s>
