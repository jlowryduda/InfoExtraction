<s> Market makers in Nasdaq over-the-counter stocks are adding their voices to the swelling chorus of complaints about program trading . </s>
<s> Their motivation , however , has a strong practical aspect : Program trading is hazardous to their paychecks . </s>
<s> The most controversial form of program trading , stock-index arbitrage , is `` making it tough for traders to make money , '' declares Robert Antolini , head of OTC trading at Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette . </s>
<s> Stock-index arbitrage -- the computer-guided buying and selling of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures to profit from fleeting price discrepancies -- affects the OTC market directly through the 31 stocks included in Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index . </s>
<s> The S&P 500 is often used in arbitrage strategies . </s>
<s> The portion of OTC volume attributable to program trading is n't known , as it is on the New York Stock Exchange , where it amounted to more than 13 % in September . </s>
<s> Estimates from traders put it at less than 5 % of Nasdaq 's average daily volume of roughly 133 million shares . </s>
<s> Other market-maker gripes : Program trading also causes the Nasdaq Composite Index to lose ground against other segments of the stock market . </s>
<s> Because of program trading it is more difficult to trade many OTC stocks without sharp price moves , a condition known as illiquidity . </s>
<s> Moreover , the price volatility that is amplified by program trading is undercutting efforts to woo individual investors back to an OTC market that sorely misses them . </s>
<s> Some of these problems are neither new nor unique to the OTC market . </s>
<s> But the big , often tumultuous slide in stock prices this month has turned some of those who have been profiting from the practice against it . </s>
<s> Peter DaPuzzo , head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton , acknowledges that he was n't troubled by program trading when it began in the pre-crash bull market because it added liquidity and people were pleased to see stock prices rising . </s>
<s> `` We were n't as concerned until they became sell programs , '' says Mr. DaPuzzo , who now thinks it adds unnecessary volatility . </s>
<s> Shearson Lehman , however , executes program trades for clients . </s>
<s> Merrill Lynch , Goldman Sachs and Kidder Peabody , in addition to Shearson , do program-trade OTC stocks . </s>
<s> Shearson , Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs say they do so only for customers , however . </s>
<s> Kidder Peabody does program trading for its own as well as clients ' accounts . </s>
<s> Of course , there were sell programs in past years , too , but they seem to hurt market makers more painfully these days . </s>
<s> That 's largely because of defensive measures they adopted after the 1987 crash , when individual investors fled the market and trading activity dwindled . </s>
<s> Market makers , to cut costs , slashed inventories of stocks they keep on hand to sell investors when other holders are n't selling . </s>
<s> And to protect their reduced capital investment from eroding further , market makers became quicker to lower price quotes when sell programs are in progress . </s>
<s> On days when prices are tumbling , they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will . </s>
<s> In such an environment , market makers can suffer huge losses both on trades made that day at steadily dropping prices and in the value of their inventories of shares . </s>
<s> `` It makes no sense for us to put money at risk when you know you 're going to lose , '' says Mr. Antolini , of Donaldson Lufkin . </s>
<s> But this skittishness , Mr. Antolini says , is creating liquidity problems in certain OTC stocks . </s>
<s> `` It 's harder to sell stocks when the sell programs come in because some market makers do n't want to -LCB- take the orders -RCB- . </s>
<s> No one has big positions and no one wants to take big risks . '' </s>
<s> Joseph Hardiman , president of the National Association of Securities Dealers , which oversees trading on Nasdaq , agrees that program trading is hurting the market 's efforts to bring back small investors . </s>
<s> But , he observes , while makers suffer losses when program trading drags the market down , they also make money when program trading pushes the prices higher . </s>
<s> `` Sometimes -LCB- traders -RCB- lose sight of that , '' he says . </s>
<s> The OTC stocks in the S&P 500 include Nasdaq 's biggest , such as Apple Computer , MCI Communications , Tele-Communications and Liz Claiborne . </s>
<s> These big stocks greatly influence the Nasdaq Composite Index . </s>
<s> When the computers say `` sell , '' the composite tumbles as well as the Dow Jones Industrial Average . </s>
<s> The problem , market makers say , is that while the industrial average and the S&P 500 usually recover as buy programs kick in , the Nasdaq Composite frequently is left behind . </s>
<s> Eight trading days after Oct. 12 , the day before the stock market plunge , for instance , the Nasdaq Composite had fallen 4.3 % , compared with 3.3 % for the S&P 500 , 3.5 % for the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index and 3.6 % for the industrial average . </s>
<s> This gap eventually closes , but slowly . </s>
<s> Three days later , as of Friday 's close , the Nasdaq Composite was down 6 % , compared with 5.9 % for the industrial average , 5.7 % for the S&P 500 and 5.8 % for the Big Board Composite . </s>
<s> The main reason for this lag is that individual investors own 65 % of the OTC market 's capitalization , according to Mr. Hardiman , much more than on the Big Board . </s>
<s> Such investors tend to be more cautious than institutional investors are about re-entering the market after massive selloffs , market makers say . </s>
<s> Friday 's Market Activity </s>
<s> The Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 5.39 , or 1.2 % to 452.76 on Friday . </s>
<s> For the week , the index dropped 3.8 % . </s>
<s> Weakness in big technology stocks hurt the composite as well as the Nasdaq 100 Index , which fell 1.4 % , or 6.43 , on Friday , to 437.68 . </s>
<s> The Nasdaq Financial Index lost about 1 % , or 3.95 , to 448.80 . </s>

<s> The average daily share turnover for October is almost 148 million shares . </s>
<s> LIN Broadcasting surged 4 5\/8 to 112 5\/8 ; LIN and BellSouth sweetened their merger agreement in an attempt to keep shareholders from tendering their shares to McCaw Cellular Communications . </s>

<s> Kirschner Medical fell 4 to 15 . </s>
<s> The company said its third-quarter earnings will probably be lower than the 16 cents a share it reported last year , despite a rise in the company 's revenue . </s>
<s> Kirschner earned $ 376,000 on revenue of $ 14.5 million in the 1988 quarter . </s>
<s> The company blamed a number of factors for the earnings decline , including softer sales of joint-implants . </s>
