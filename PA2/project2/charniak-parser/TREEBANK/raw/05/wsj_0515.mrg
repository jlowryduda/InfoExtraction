<s> It is a peaceful time in this part of western India . </s>
<s> The summer crop is harvested , winter sowing has yet to begin . </s>
<s> Farmers in loose turbans and fancy earrings spend their afternoons laughing and gossiping at the markets . </s>
<s> One could imagine such a lull in the lives of the Arabs before the quadrupling of oil prices . </s>
<s> For just as the Arabs were in the 1960s , the farmers of Sidhpur are on the brink of global power and fame . </s>
<s> The Arabs had merely oil . </s>
<s> These farmers may have a grip on the world 's very heart . </s>
<s> Or , at least , its heart disease . </s>
<s> That is because Sidhpur has a near-monopoly on the world 's supply of flea seed , also known as flea wort or , in Western parlance , psyllium : a tiny , tasteless , obscure seed that , according to early research , may reduce cholesterol levels in the blood . </s>
<s> Ever since the link to cholesterol was disclosed , Americans have begun scarfing up psyllium in their breakfast cereals . </s>
<s> If further research proves the seed 's benefits , this dusty farm district could become the epicenter of a health-food fad to rival all fads since cod-liver oil . </s>
<s> `` This seed 's not grown anywhere else in India , or anywhere else in the world , '' says T.V. Krishnamurthy , a vice president of Procter & Gamble India Ltd. , a major psyllium buyer and promoter . </s>
<s> `` The proper climatic conditions do n't exist in many places in the world . '' </s>
<s> Arvind Patel , a processor and exporter of the seed , raves : `` If psyllium takes the place of oat bran , it will be huge . '' </s>
<s> Whether psyllium makes Sidhpur 's fortune depends on cholesterol-fearing Americans , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and , of course , the outcome of further research . </s>
<s> Only one thing is certain here : Pysllium is likely to remain solely an export item from Sidhpur for a long time . </s>
<s> Local farmers say it is as good a cash crop as mustard or fenugreek , a legume . </s>
<s> But they have no desire to eat a bowl of psyllium each morning , and , perhaps , little need : lean , frugal vegetarians , the farmers are innocents in the clogged , treacherous world of cholesterol . </s>
<s> Psyllium is an annual herb , Plantago ovata , that has been used for centuries by folk doctors here , mainly as a laxative and anti-diarrheal . </s>
<s> As such , the soluble fiber has an almost fanatic following in northern India . </s>
<s> `` I can assure you , '' attests a 25-year-old lawyer in New Delhi , with a meaningfully raised eyebrow , `` from personal experience , it works . '' </s>
<s> A prominent businessman in Bombay gives a similar testimonial : `` I have been taking it daily since 1961 . </s>
<s> '' Folk doctors also prescribe it for kidney , bladder and urethra problems , duodenal ulcers and hemorrhoids . </s>
<s> Some apply it to gouty joints . </s>
<s> The plant has a hairy stem that produces flowers and diminutive seeds . </s>
<s> It is the seed 's colorlessness and size -- 1,000 of them weigh only 1.5 grams , or about as much as two paper clips -- that explain the historical allusions to fleas . </s>
<s> The transluscent husk of the seed is removed , sifted and crushed ; the seed itself is fed to animals . </s>
<s> Some 90 % of the crop , which was worth $ 26 million last year , is exported . </s>
<s> For decades , psyllium husk has been the main ingredient in such laxatives as Procter & Gamble Co. 's Metamucil , the top-selling brand in the U.S. , and Ciba-Geigy Corp. 's Fiberall . </s>
<s> But some time ago , researchers discovered that soluble fibers also lower cholesterol levels in the blood . </s>
<s> Cincinnati-based P&G took an interest ; it ordered two studies on psyllium and cholesterol . </s>
<s> One of the studies , done at the University of Minnesota , tested 75 people with raised cholesterol levels . </s>
<s> After 16 weeks , the group that took three daily teaspoons of Metamucil saw a significant dip in their general cholesterol levels , and an even larger reduction in levels of low-density lipoproteins , the so-called bad cholesterol . </s>
<s> In late 1987 , P&G asked the FDA for approval to market Metamucil as the first non-prescription , cholesterol-lowering product in the </s>
<s> In April , the psyllium bandwagon got more crowded . </s>
<s> General Mills Inc. , the food giant , launched a breakfast cereal called Benefit , containing psyllium , oat , wheat and beet bran ; the words , `` reduce cholesterol '' were prominently displayed on its package . </s>
<s> In September , Kellogg Co. launched a competing psyllium-fortified cereal called Heartwise . </s>
<s> Suddenly , on television , in advertisements and on their cereal boxes , Americans were inundated with news about the obscure seed . </s>
<s> The flood of claims and counter-claims worried consumers and actually hurt sales of the new cereals . </s>
<s> This month , the Food and Drug Administration expressed concern that Americans might someday , in various forms , ingest too much psyllium . </s>
<s> Currently , there is a lull in the psyllium war . </s>
<s> The FDA has asked Kellogg and General Mills to show research that their cereals are safe . </s>
<s> It also ordered P&G to produce more studies to buttress its claims that Metamucil can lower cholesterol . </s>
<s> But the agency has n't yanked psyllium off store shelves . </s>
<s> If the FDA approves the new uses of psyllium , other companies are expected to rush to market with psyllium products . </s>
<s> `` It 's going to be a sensational thing , '' says Mr. Krishnamurthy of P&G in Bombay . </s>
<s> Says psyllium exporter Mr. Patel : `` I just got back yesterday from the U.S. . </s>
<s> In the newspapers , on the radio and TV , psyllium is everywhere . '' </s>
<s> But the news of the boom has yet to trickle down to the farmers . </s>
<s> They only know of one use for the crop , as a laxative , and with psyllium prices currently languishing in the wake of a bumper crop , they think of the seed as a marginal crop , something to grow between summer wheat crops . </s>
<s> `` Psyllium 's not a good crop , '' complains Sooraji Jath , a 26-year-old farmer from the village of Lakshmipura . `` </s>
<s> You get a rain at the wrong time and the crop is ruined . '' </s>
<s> Even at the Basic Chemicals , Pharmaceuticals and Cosmetics Export Promotion Council , the government agency that promotes the seed , the psyllium boom is distant thunder . </s>
<s> The staff brags about psyllium 's hefty contribution to American regularity , without quite grasping the implications of the research on cholesterol . </s>
<s> The council 's annual report has psyllium on its last page , lumped with such unglamorous export items as sarsaparilla and `` Nux vomica , '' a plant that induces vomiting . </s>
<s> In one way , the psyllium middlemen -- the buyers and exporters -- are glad to keep news of the boom to themselves . </s>
<s> They want psyllium prices low for their purchases next year . </s>
<s> But there 's a catch . </s>
<s> Sidhpur and adjacent districts are the only places in the world where psyllium is grown in large quantities . </s>
<s> This is partly due to the particular demands of the crop . </s>
<s> Psyllium needs sandy soil , dew during the first few weeks , and then total dryness when its seeds are maturing . </s>
<s> Small crops are grown in Pakistan , France , Spain , Italy , Belgium and Brazil , but their quality ca n't compare to that of Indian psyllium . </s>
<s> Big buyers like Procter & Gamble say there are other spots on the globe , and in India , where the seed could be grown . </s>
<s> `` It 's not a crop that ca n't be doubled or tripled , '' says Mr. Krishnamurthy . </s>
<s> But no one has made a serious effort to transplant the crop . </s>
<s> In Sidhpur , it is almost time to sow this year 's crop . </s>
<s> Many farmers , too removed to glean psyllium 's new sparkle in the West , have decided to plant mustard , fennel , cumin , fenugreek or castor-oil seeds . </s>
<s> Mr. Jath is thinking of passing up psyllium altogether this year in favor of a crop with a future such as cumin or fennel . </s>
<s> `` Maybe I 'll plant castor-oil seeds . '' </s>
<s> His brother , Parkhaji , whose head is swathed in a gorgeous crimson turban , nods vigorous assent . </s>
<s> So when next year 's psyllium crop is harvested in March , it may be smaller than the 16,000 metric tons of the past few years -- right at the crest of the psyllium boom . </s>
<s> And the world could experience its first psyllium shortage . </s>
