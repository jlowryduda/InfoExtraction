<s> The envelope arrives in the mail . </s>
<s> Open it and two soulful eyes on a boy 's brown face peer out from the page , pleadingly . </s>
<s> Does the tyke have a good mind about to be wasted ? </s>
<s> Is he a victim of Gramm-Rudman cuts ? </s>
<s> No , but he 's endangered all the same : His new sitcom on ABC needs a following to stay on the air . </s>
<s> ABC has n't had much luck with shows featuring blacks in recent years , and the producers of one new arrival are a bit desperate . </s>
<s> `` Homeroom , '' a show about a black ad executive who gives up the boardroom for a fourth-grade classroom , is flunking the ratings test . </s>
<s> So producers Alyce and Topper Carew spun their Rolodexes and gathered names of black opinion makers to mount a direct-mail campaign . </s>
<s> By wooing a core black audience they figure they might keep the show alive at least until the spring semester . </s>
<s> Using direct mail for a TV show is like fishing for whale with a breaded hook . </s>
<s> It just is n't done . </s>
<s> But employing this kind of gut-wrenching plea to black consciousness makes it even more unusual . </s>
<s> Still , Mr. Carew thinks he can reach a good chunk of the three million-plus black homes he needs by mailing to the almost 10,000 blacks who form what he calls `` the grapevine . '' </s>
<s> `` The grapevine is n't organized , but you and I know it exists , '' says Mr. Carew , referring to the often uncannily small world of black professionals and community leaders . </s>
<s> `` This is a very personal , ethnic style , '' Mr. Carew says . `` </s>
<s> I want people in the barber shops and the beauty shops and standing in line at the rib joints to be talking about the show . </s>
<s> I want white America to talk about it , too , but I 'm convinced that the grapevine is what 's happening . '' </s>
<s> ABC says it is aware of the producers ' action , but the mailing was sent without the network 's blessing . </s>
<s> The letter , in fact , takes a jab at ABC for being a laggard in black programming . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , as the Sunday evening show struggles to stay afloat against the tough competition of `` Murder , She Wrote , '' the grapevine idea is threatening to turn into a weed : The tactic apparently has inspired sample viewings , but accolades are slow in coming . </s>
<s> Doug Alligood , a black advertising executive who tracks black viewing patterns , gives the Carews an `` A '' for marketing moxie , but is n't alone in his lukewarm reaction . </s>
<s> Some shows just do n't impress , he says , and this is one of them . </s>
