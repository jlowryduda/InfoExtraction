<s> When Michael S. Perry took the podium at a recent cosmetics industry event , more than 500 executives packing the room snapped to attention . </s>
<s> Mr. Perry , who runs Unilever Group 's world-wide personal-care business , paused to scan the crowd . </s>
<s> `` I see we have about half the audience working for us , '' he said , tongue in cheek . </s>
<s> `` The other half , we may have before long . '' </s>
<s> Members of the audience gasped or laughed nervously ; their industry has been unsettled recently by acquisitions . </s>
<s> First Unilever , the Anglo-Dutch packaged-goods giant , spent $ 2 billion to acquire brands such as Faberge and Elizabeth Arden . </s>
<s> It now holds the No. 3 position at U.S. department-store cosmetic counters . </s>
<s> Then Procter & Gamble Co. agreed to buy Noxell Corp. for $ 1.3 billion . </s>
<s> That acquisition , to be completed by year end , will include the Cover Girl and Clarion makeup lines , making P&G the top marketer of cosmetics in mass-market outlets . </s>
<s> It 's not so much the idea of acquisitions that has agitated the cosmetics industry as the companies doing the acquiring : P&G and Unilever bring with them great experience with mundane products like soap and toilet paper , sparking disdain in the glitzy cosmetics trade ; but they also bring mammoth marketing clout , sparking fear . </s>
<s> Though it is far from certain that companies best known for selling Promise margarine and Tide detergent will succeed in cosmetics , there 's little doubt they will shake up the industry . </s>
<s> For now , both companies are keeping quiet about their specific plans . </s>
<s> But industry watchers expect them to blend the methodical marketing strategies they use for more mundane products with the more intuitive approach typical of cosmetics companies . </s>
<s> Likely changes include more emphasis on research , soaring advertising budgets and aggressive pricing . </s>
<s> But some cosmetics-industry executives wonder whether techniques honed in packaged goods will translate to the cosmetics business . </s>
<s> Estee Lauder Inc. , Revlon Inc. and other cosmetics houses traditionally have considered themselves fashion enterprises whose product development is guided by the creative intuition of their executives . </s>
<s> Cosmetics companies roll out new makeup colors several times a year , and since most products can be easily copied by competitors , they 're loath to test them with consumers . </s>
<s> `` Just because upscale cosmetics look like packaged goods and smell like packaged goods , it does n't mean they are packaged goods , '' says Leonard Lauder , chief executive of Estee Lauder . </s>
<s> `` They 're really fashion items wrapped up in little jars . '' </s>
<s> In contrast to the more artistic nature of traditional cosmetics houses , Unilever and P&G are the habitats of organization men in gray-flannel suits . </s>
<s> Both companies are conservative marketers that rely on extensive market research . </s>
<s> P&G , in particular , rarely rolls out a product nationally before extensive test-marketing . </s>
<s> Both can be extremely aggressive at pricing such products as soaps and diapers -- to the extent that some industry consultants predict cents-off coupons for mascara could result from their entry into the field . </s>
<s> P&G already has shown it can meld some traditional packaged-goods techniques with the image-making of the cosmetics trade in the mass-market end of the business . </s>
<s> Consider Oil of Olay , which P&G acquired as part of Richardson-Vicks International in 1985 . </s>
<s> The moisturizer , introduced in 1962 , had a dowdy image . </s>
<s> `` Oil of Olay brought with it the baggage of being used basically by older women who had already aged , '' says David Williams , a consultant with New England Consulting Group . </s>
<s> P&G set out to reposition the brand by broadening the product line to include facial cleansers and moisturizers for sensitive skin . </s>
<s> It also redesigned Oil of Olay 's packaging , stamping the traditional pink boxes with gold lines to create a more opulent look . </s>
<s> Moreover , P&G shifted its ad campaign from one targeting older women to one featuring a woman in her mid-30s vowing `` not to grow old gracefully . '' </s>
<s> The company says sales have soared . </s>
<s> Goliaths like Unilever and P&G have enormous financial advantages over smaller rivals . </s>
<s> Next year , Noxell plans to roll out a perfume called Navy , says George L. Bunting Jr. , chairman of Noxell . </s>
<s> Without P&G 's backing , Noxell might not have been able to spend the estimated $ 5 million to $ 7 million needed to accomplish that without scrimping on its existing brands . </s>
<s> Packaged-goods companies `` will make it tougher for smaller people to remain competitive , '' Mr. Bunting says . </s>
<s> Further consolidations in the industry could follow . </s>
<s> Rumors that Unilever is interested in acquiring Schering-Plough Corp. 's Maybelline unit are widespread . </s>
<s> Unilever wo n't comment ; Schering , however , denies the brand is for sale . </s>
<s> The presence of Unilever and P&G is likely to increase the impact of advertising on cosmetics . </s>
<s> While the two are among the world 's biggest advertisers , most makers of upscale cosmetics spend relatively little on national ads . </s>
<s> Instead , they focus on events in department stores and pour their promotional budgets into gifts that go along with purchases . </s>
<s> Estee Lauder , for example , spends only an estimated 5 % of sales on advertising in the U.S. , and Mr. Lauder says he has no plans to change his strategy . </s>
<s> The most dramatic changes , however , probably will come in new-product development . </s>
<s> Nearly 70 % of cosmetics sales come through mass-distribution outlets such as drug stores and supermarkets , according to Andrew Shore , an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc . </s>
<s> That figure has been inching up for several years . </s>
<s> As the trend continues , demand for mass-market items that are high quality but only mid-priced -- particularly skin-care products -- is expected to increase . </s>
<s> This fall , for example , L'Oreal Group , ordinarily a high-end line , rolled out a drug-store line of skin-care products called Plenitude , which retail for $ 5 to $ 15 . </s>
<s> The packaged-goods marketers may try filling that gap with a spate of new products . </s>
<s> Unlike the old-line cosmetics houses , Unilever and P&G both have enormous research and development bases to draw on for new products . </s>
<s> P&G , in fact , is noted for gaining market leadership by introducing products that offer a technical edge over the competition . </s>
<s> Sales of its Tide detergent soared earlier this year , for example , after P&G introduced a version that includes a bleach safe for all colors and fabrics . </s>
<s> That 's led industry executives to speculate that future product development will be driven more by technological innovation than by fashion whims -- especially among mass-market brands . </s>
<s> `` There will be more emphasis on quality , '' says Guy Peyrelongue , chief executive of Cosmair Inc. , the U.S. licensee of L'Oreal . </s>
<s> `` You 'll see fewer gimmicks . '' </s>
<s> But success for Unilever and P&G is far from guaranteed , as shown by the many consumer-product companies that have tried and failed to master the quirky beauty business . </s>
<s> In the 1970s , several pharmaceutical and packaged-goods companies , including Colgate-Palmolive Co. , Eli Lilly & Co. , Pfizer Inc. and Schering-Plough acquired cosmetics companies . </s>
<s> Industry consultants say only Schering-Plough , which makes the mass-market Maybelline , has maintained a meaningful business . </s>
<s> Colgate , which acquired Helena Rubenstein in 1973 , sold the brand seven years later after the brand languished . </s>
<s> Unilever already has experienced some disappointment . </s>
<s> The mass-market Aziza brand , which it acquired in 1987 along with Chesebrough-Pond 's Inc. , has lost share , according to industry analysts . </s>
<s> The ritzy world of department-store cosmetics retailing , where Unilever is concentrating its efforts , may prove even more treacherous . </s>
<s> In this niche , makeup colors change seasonally because they are linked to ready-to-wear fashions . </s>
<s> Because brand loyalty is weak and most cosmetics purchases are unplanned , careful training of store sales staffs by cosmetics companies is important . </s>
<s> And cultivating a luxury image strong enough to persuade consumers to pay more than $ 15 for lipstick or eye makeup requires a subtle touch that packaged-goods companies have yet to demonstrate on their own . </s>
