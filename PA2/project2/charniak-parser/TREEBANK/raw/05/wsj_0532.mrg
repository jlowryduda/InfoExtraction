<s> James Gatward , TVS 's chief executive , said in a statement that he will `` assume overall responsibility '' for MTM 's operations until a successor is named . </s>
<s> Industry analysts speculated that Mr. Price 's sudden departure may have stemmed from conflicts with Mr. Gatward . </s>

<s> In the TVS statement , Mr. Price said `` leaving MTM was a very difficult decision , '' but added that `` it is now time for a change ... . '' </s>
<s> The $ 320 million purchase of MTM represented an audacious international move for TVS , which then was about half the U.S. concern 's size . </s>
