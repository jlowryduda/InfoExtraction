<s> We 're sorry to see Nigel Lawson 's departure from the British government . </s>
<s> He is a politician with the courage of true conviction , as in summarily sacking exchange controls and in particular slashing the top rate of income taxation to 40 % . </s>
<s> But in the end his resignation as Chancellor of the Exchequer may be a good thing , especially if it works as he no doubt intends -- by forcing Prime Minister Thatcher and her counterparts elsewhere to confront the genuine intellectual issues involved . </s>
<s> The early omens , we admit , scarcely suggest so wholesome an outcome . </s>
<s> The Fleet Street reaction was captured in the Guardian headline , `` Departure Reveals Thatcher Poison . '' </s>
<s> British politicians divide into two groups of chickens , those with their necks cut and those screaming the sky is falling . </s>
<s> So far as we can see only two persons are behaving with a dignity recognizing the seriousness of the issues : Mr. Lawson and Sir Alan Walters , the counterpoint of the Chancellor 's difficulties , who also resigned as personal adviser to Mrs. Thatcher . </s>
<s> The problem is that on the vital issue of monetary policy and exchange rates , conservative , free-market economists divide into at least three incompatible camps . </s>
<s> There are the strict monetarists , who believe that floating exchange rates free an economy to stabilize its price level by stabilizing the monetary aggregates . </s>
<s> There are the supply-side globalists , who seek to spread the advantages of a common currency through fixed exchange rates . </s>
<s> And there are the twin-deficit Keynesians , who predict\/advocate devaluations to balance trade flows . </s>
<s> This is a problem not only for Prime Minister Thatcher but for President Bush , as shown in the ongoing bickering over the dollar between the Federal Reserve and the Mulford Treasury . </s>
<s> In the British case , Mr. Lawson is the closest thing in London to a supply-side globalist . </s>
<s> He not only slashed marginal tax rates , initially sparking fresh growth in Britain , but he wanted to regulate monetary policy by targeting exchange rates , indeed joining the European Monetary System . </s>
<s> While no doubt agreeing with Mr. Lawson on everything else , Sir Alan is a dyed-in-the-wool monetarist , inclined to defend floating rates to the death . </s>
<s> To make matters even more confusing , the earlier U.S. experience made clear that Mr. Lawson 's tax cuts would have profound effects on Britain 's international accounts and the value of sterling . </s>
<s> They increased the after-tax rate of return and made Britain a far more attractive place to invest , producing sudden capital inflows . </s>
<s> By accounting definitions , this had to produce a sudden trade deficit . </s>
<s> As in the U.S. , it also produced a sudden burst in the demand for sterling , that is a surge in the sterling monetary aggregates , M-Whatever . </s>
<s> At this point , the options were : Crunch money to stop the boost in the aggregates , as Sir Alan surely advised , and forget the soaring pound . </s>
<s> To push the pound even lower trying to cure the trade deficit , a policy Britain has repeatedly proved disastrous . </s>
<s> Or to supply enough money to meet the increased demand and stabilize the exchange rate , as the Chancellor argued , and ensure the permanence of this policy by joining the EMS . </s>
<s> Faced with a similar situation , Paul Volcker let the dollar soar , -LRB- though monetary aggregates also grew so rapidly monetarists issued egg-on-the-face warnings of inflation -RRB- . </s>
<s> But this devastated the U.S. manufacturing sector , laying the seeds of protectionism . </s>
<s> Mr. Lawson , though not allowed to join the EMS , chose to `` shadow '' the deutsche mark . </s>
<s> He reaped inflation along with rapid growth , no doubt validating Sir Alan 's predictions in the Prime Minister 's mind . </s>
<s> But more recently , the pound has been falling with high inflation , which has also seemed almost impervious to the high interest rates Mr. Lawson deployed to stop it . </s>
<s> So the British experience presents a genuine puzzle that reaches far beyond the shores of Albion . </s>
<s> We had been soliciting opinions on it long before Mr. Lawson 's resignation , and offer some of the collection for the benefit of his successor and one-time deputy , John Major . </s>
<s> To begin with , we should note that in contrast to the U.S. deficit , Britain has been running largish budget surpluses . </s>
<s> In pursuit of this mystery , Keynesian adepts and twin-deficit mavens need not apply . </s>
<s> We should also add Mr. Lawson 's own explanation , as we understand it . </s>
<s> Unlike the U.S. , Britain never achieved even a momentary reduction in real wages . </s>
<s> The wage stickiness , which OECD studies confirm is particularly high in Britain , gives its economy a structural bias toward inflation . </s>
<s> Inflation is easier to spark and harder to control . </s>
<s> We should also concede that in the British experience the monetarist cause regains some of the credibility it lost in the U.S. experience . </s>
<s> Nearby Paul Craig Roberts , a distinguished supply-sider with monetarist sympathies , argues the case for Sir Alan . </s>
<s> Perhaps the fiscal shock of tax cuts is after all best absorbed by floating rates , though of course in the event Mr. Lawson resigned over whether to support a weak pound , not restrain a strong one . </s>
<s> We recall that Mr. Roberts not only chides the Chancellor for being too easy because of a desire to constrain sterling , but also led the chorus saying that Mr. Volcker was too tight when he let the dollar rise . </s>
<s> Somewhere in between there must be a golden mean , perhaps measured by M-Whatever , but perhaps measured by purchasing power parity . </s>
<s> The globalists tend to think Mr. Lawson ran onto technical reefs . </s>
<s> In fixing rates the choice of initial parities is crucial , for example , and perhaps he picked the wrong pound-DM rate . </s>
<s> For that matter , perhaps he fixed to the wrong currency . </s>
<s> We sympathize with Mrs. Thatcher 's reluctance to tie her currency to one governed by the domestic political imperatives of West Germany . </s>
<s> Perhaps the shock would have been less if they 'd fixed to another low-tax , deregulated , supply-side economy . </s>
<s> Alan Reynolds of Polyconomics adds his suspicion that the unrecognized inflationary culprit is the budget surplus . </s>
<s> Those who can shake Keynesian ghosts out of their heads might recognize that the retirement of gilts for cash is equivalent to an expansionary open-market operation , indeed , it is the definition of an open market operation to expand the money supply . </s>
<s> Mr. Reynolds also notes that since British banks have no reserve requirements , high interest rates are less likely to curb inflation than to cause recession . </s>
<s> We would add that in political terms , Mrs. Thatcher 's problem was failing to decide between the Chancellor and her adviser . </s>
<s> In the end , neither policy was followed , and instead of learning anything we are left with a mystery . </s>
<s> In particular , `` shadowing '' a currency is anything but fixing ; it is an open announcement that the exchange rate target has no credibility . </s>
<s> All the more so when strong voices are heard opposing the policy . </s>
<s> Better to have a true monetarist policy , just for the experience . </s>
<s> So Mr. Lawson had to resign . </s>
<s> In the end his move was sparked by remarks in excerpts from Sir Alan 's autobiography in The American Economist , a 10,000-circulation academic journal . </s>
<s> But it was the underlying situation that became intolerable . </s>
<s> What Mr. Major and Mrs. Thatcher will do now remains to be seen . </s>
<s> They confront stubborn inflation and a sagging economy , that is to say , stagflation . </s>
<s> This can not be solved by provoking a further downturn ; reducing the supply of goods does not solve inflation . </s>
<s> Our advice is this : Immediately return the government surpluses to the economy through incentive-maximizing tax cuts , and find some monetary policy target that balances both supply and demand for money -LRB- which neither aggregates nor interest rates can do -RRB- . </s>
<s> This was the version of supply-side economics that , in the late 1970s and early '80s , worked in America and world-wide to solve a far more serious stagflation than afflicts Britain today . </s>
