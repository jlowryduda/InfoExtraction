<s> Last week the British displayed unusual political immaturity . </s>
<s> The Chancellor of the Exchequer , Nigel Lawson , resigned because Prime Minister Thatcher would not fire her trusted adviser Sir Alan Walters . </s>
<s> The opposition Labor Party leader , Neil Kinnock , in a display of the male chauvinism typical of the British lower class , denounced Mrs. Thatcher for having an independent mind and refusing to heed the men in her Cabinet . </s>
<s> The British press , making a mountain out of a molehill , precipitated an unnecessary economic crisis by portraying Mrs. Thatcher as an autocrat who had thrown economic policy into confusion by driving a respected figure from her government . </s>
<s> Behind the silly posturing lies a real dispute . </s>
<s> Mr. Lawson and his European-minded colleagues want the British pound formally tied to the West German mark . </s>
<s> Sir Alan considers this an ill-advised and costly policy . </s>
<s> As there is an effort to `` anchor the dollar '' either to gold or other currencies , the dispute is worth examining . </s>
<s> Until his resignation , Mr. Lawson had been conducting British monetary policy as if the pound were tied to the mark . </s>
<s> When Mrs. Thatcher cut the top tax rate to 40 % , Mr. Lawson flooded the country with money to prevent the pound from rising against the mark . </s>
<s> As a result , he reignited the inflation that Mrs. Thatcher , through a long and costly effort , had subdued . </s>
<s> With inflation surging , the pound began falling against the mark . </s>
<s> To keep the exchange rate pegged , Mr. Lawson tightened monetary policy and pushed interest rates up to 15 % . </s>
<s> This doubled the mortgage interest rates of the many new homeowners that Mrs. Thatcher 's policies had created , producing widespread disaffection and pushing Labor ahead in the polls . </s>
<s> Instead of realizing his mistake in letting the exchange rate dominate both British economic policy and Mrs. Thatcher 's political fortune , Mr. Lawson pushed for tying the pound formally to the mark by entering the European Monetary System , which subordinates all member currencies to German monetary policy . </s>
<s> This put Mrs. Thatcher in a bind . </s>
<s> The concept of European integration is one of those grand schemes that appeal to intellectuals , the media and the imagination , but are full of practical pitfalls . </s>
<s> If the pound had been tied to the mark , the British would have been unable to cut their exorbitant tax rates . </s>
<s> The reason is simple . </s>
<s> When a country cuts tax rates , it makes itself more attractive to investors and drives up the value of its currency . </s>
<s> It was fear of disturbing EMS exchange-rate relationships that caused the Chirac government in France to be timid about cutting tax rates . </s>
<s> Edouard Balladur , the finance minister at the time , was sold on the tax-cut policy but was concerned that his government would be criticized as anti-European for disturbing the linked European currency relationship . </s>
<s> The price of attracting capital -- whether one 's own or that of foreigners -- is a trade deficit . </s>
<s> To avoid this deficit Mr. Lawson inflated the pound in order to prevent its rise . </s>
<s> This misguided policy could not prevent a British trade deficit . </s>
<s> Consequently , Mr. Lawson saddled Mrs. Thatcher with a record trade deficit , renewed inflation and high interest rates -- three political failures in a row . </s>
<s> Little wonder that Mrs. Thatcher 's opponents were so anxious to keep Mr. Lawson in office . </s>
<s> It is extraordinary that the British Treasury thought it could prevent a trade deficit by inflating the pound . </s>
<s> The British balance-of-payments statistics show that after the top tax rate was cut to 40 % , the flow abroad of British capital slowed , to 50 billion pounds -LRB- $ 79 billion at the current rate -RRB- in 1988 from 93 billion pounds in 1986 . </s>
<s> This change in the British capital account required an offsetting change in the trade account , a change that could not be prevented by pegging the currency . </s>
<s> Nigel Lawson was a victim of the immense confusion in thought that has been characteristic of Western financial circles during the 1980s . </s>
<s> The most important governments have ignored the role of low tax rates in attracting real capital investment , instead emphasizing financial flows in response to high interest rates . </s>
<s> This has led them in a fruitless and destructive policy circle . </s>
<s> First comes monetary expansion to drive down the currency 's value that was pushed up by tax-rate reduction . </s>
<s> Then , when the currency falls , interest rates are raised to attract financial flows in order to stabilize the exchange rate . </s>
<s> This policy is totally mindless , and Sir Alan is correct to point out its deficiencies . </s>
<s> Britain and all of Europe need to reconsider the prospects for European integration in light of the possible reunification and neutralization of Germany . </s>
<s> A unified Germany that remained within the Western alliance would give Germany such an overshadowing position that all other members of a unified Europe would become vassals of the German state . </s>
<s> Unless the Soviet Union collapses , German reunification is likely to require Germany 's neutralization . </s>
<s> The implications for Britain , France and the rest of Europe of having their currencies tied to the economic policy of a neutral country need considering before we judge Mr. Lawson 's resignation to be unfortunate . </s>
<s> In the least , we must recognize the futility of trying to use exchange-rate intervention to offset the effects of tax-rate reduction on capital flows . </s>
<s> Mr. Roberts was assistant Treasury secretary under President Reagan . </s>
