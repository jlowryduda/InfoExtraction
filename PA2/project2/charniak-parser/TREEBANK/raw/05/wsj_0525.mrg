<s> While Wall Street is retreating from computer-driven program trading , big institutional investors are likely to continue these strategies at full blast , further roiling the stock market , trading executives say . </s>
<s> Bowing to a mounting public outcry , three more major securities firms -- Bear , Stearns & Co. Inc. , Morgan Stanley & Co. and Oppenheimer & Co. -- announced Friday they would suspend stock-index arbitrage trading for their own accounts . </s>
<s> PaineWebber Group Inc. announced a pullback on Thursday from stock-index arbitrage , a controversial program-trading strategy blamed by many investors for encouraging big stock-market swings . </s>
<s> Though the trading halts are offered as a sign of concern about recent stock market volatility , most Wall Street firms remain open to handle program trading for customers . </s>
<s> Trading executives privately say that huge stock-index funds , which dwarf Wall Street firms in terms of the size of their program trades , will continue to launch big programs through the stock market . </s>
<s> Wells Fargo Investment Advisers , Bankers Trust Co. and Mellon Capital Management are among the top stock-index arbitrage clients of Wall Street , trading executives say . </s>
<s> These huge stock-index funds build portfolios that match the S&P 500 stock index or other stock indexes , and frequently swap between stocks and futures to capture profits . </s>
<s> `` They will do it every chance they get , '' said one program-trading executive . </s>
<s> Consequently , abrupt swings in the stock market are not likely to disappear anytime soon , they say . </s>
<s> In fact , without Wall Street firms trading for their own accounts , the stock-index arbitrage trading opportunities for the big funds may be all the more abundant . </s>
<s> `` More customers may come to us now , '' said James Cayne , president of Bear Stearns Cos . </s>
<s> Executives who manage these funds see the current debate over program trading as a repeat of the concern expressed after the 1987 crash . </s>
<s> They noted that studies completed after the 1987 crash exonerated program trading as a source of volatility . </s>
<s> `` The issues that are -LRB- now -RRB- being raised , in classic anti-intellectual fashion , fly in the face of a number of post-crash studies , '' said Fred Grauer , chairman of Wells Fargo Investment Advisers . </s>
<s> A Bankers Trust spokesman said that the company 's investment arm uses stock-index arbitrage to enhance investors ' returns . </s>
<s> Officials at Mellon Capital were unavailable for comment . </s>
<s> Stock-index funds have grown in popularity over the past decade as pension funds and other institutional investors have sought a low-cost way to match the performance of the stock market as a whole . </s>
<s> Many money managers who trade stock actively have trouble consistently matching the S&P-500 's returns . </s>
<s> Some stock-index funds are huge . </s>
<s> Wells Fargo Investment Advisers , for example , managed $ 25 billion in stock investments tracking the S&P 500 at the end of June , according to Standard & Poor 's Corp . </s>
<s> Mr. Grauer said $ 2 billion of that is used in active index arbitrage . </s>
<s> Stock-index funds frequently use the futures markets as a hedging tool , but that is a far less aggressive strategy than stock-index arbitrage , in which traders buy and sell big blocks of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures to profit from price differences . </s>
<s> The 190-point plunge in the stock market Oct. 13 has heightened concerns about volatility . </s>
<s> And while signs of an economic slowdown , softer corporate earnings and troubles with takeover financing all have contributed to the stock market 's recent weakness , many investors rushed to blame program trading for aggravating market swings . </s>
<s> The Wall Street firms ' pullback followed their recent blacklisting by several institutional investors . </s>
<s> Last Tuesday , Kemper Corp. 's Kemper Financial Services Inc. unit said it would no longer trade with firms committed to stock-index arbitrage , including the three that later suspended stock-index arbitrage trading on Friday . </s>
<s> Phoenix Mutual Life Insurance Co. and Founders Asset Management Inc. also cut off brokerage firms that engage in program trading . </s>
<s> Though it is still doing stock-index arbitrage trades for customers , Morgan Stanley 's trading halt for its own account is likely to shake up firms such as Kidder , Peabody & Co. that still do such trades for their own account . </s>
<s> Morgan Stanley has consistently been one of the top stock-index arbitrage traders in recent months . </s>
<s> Indeed , Morgan Stanley 's president , Richard B. Fisher , said the firm is putting up money to form a group of regulators , investors and investment banks to find out if stock-index arbitrage artificially induces stock-market volatility . </s>
<s> `` We have to clear up these issues and find out what is present that is creating artificial volatility , '' Mr. Fisher said . </s>
<s> `` There is no question that investor confidence -LRB- in the stock market -RRB- is critical . '' </s>
<s> Joining the call for some kind of study or regulatory action , Merrill Lynch & Co. recommended program-trading reforms late Friday , including higher margins on stock-index futures and greater regulatory coordination . </s>
<s> Separately , Mr. Cayne of Bear Stearns said his firm is working with regulators to balance margin requirements to `` enhance stabilization . '' </s>
<s> Margin rules determine the minimum amount of cash an investor must put up when buying a security . </s>
<s> Current rules permit investors to put up less cash for futures than for stocks . </s>
<s> Some observers say that different rules governing stock and futures markets are partly responsible for volatility . </s>
<s> These rules , they say , permit faster and cheaper trading in futures than in stocks , which frequently knocks the two markets out of line . </s>
<s> Stock-index arbitrage , because it sells the more `` expensive '' market and buys the `` cheaper '' one , attempts to reestablish the link between the stock and futures markets , and the adjustments are often abrupt . </s>
<s> But unequal trading rules allow the futures market to trade differently from stocks , which invites frequent bouts of stock-index arbitrage in the first place . </s>
<s> `` There has to be better coordination on a regulatory basis , '' said Christopher Pedersen , director of trading at Twenty-First Securities Corp . </s>
<s> `` One agency should have the authority over all equity products . </s>
