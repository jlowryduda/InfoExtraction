<s> Switzerland 's most famous raider says he is n't one . </s>
<s> Werner K. Rey believes fortunes are made by being friendly . </s>
<s> And in little more than a decade of being friendly -- and at the same time rocking the staid Swiss business community with some U.S.-style wheeling and dealing -- the 46-year-old Mr. Rey has grown from a modest banker to a billionaire . </s>
<s> He achieved this in part with an uncanny talent for getting his foot peacefully in the door of established European companies . </s>
<s> His latest coup : September 's masterminding of the five billion Swiss-franc -LRB- $ 3.07 billion -RRB- merger between Adia S.A. , the world 's second-largest temporary employment agency , and Inspectorate International S.A. , a Rey-controlled product-inspection company . </s>
<s> Shareholders must approve the merger at general meetings of the two companies in late November . </s>
<s> But approval is almost certain since Mr. Rey and a friendly Adia management are in control . </s>
<s> After the transaction , Mr. Rey estimates the value of his 20 % stake in the new company , to be held by his Omni Holding AG , will be about 1 billion Swiss francs . </s>
<s> This will be his return on an original investment of between 50 million Swiss francs and 80 million Swiss francs . </s>
<s> Mr. Rey bought a controlling stake in Inspectorate for 18 million Swiss francs in 1982 , building up the little-known engineering company with European and U.S. acquisitions . </s>
<s> `` I like to succeed , '' says Mr. Rey during a recent morning of working at home , which he also likes . </s>
<s> Home is an estate with green meadows opening onto Lake Geneva and a low-slung house whose rooms overlook the water and offer a view of the French Alps . </s>
<s> In the corner of his reception room is a delicate antique desk piled high with dossiers . </s>
<s> There is a small Renoir on the wall . </s>
<s> Zurich-based magazine Bilanz lists Mr. Rey as having a fortune of about 1.5 billion Swiss francs . </s>
<s> Writes Bilanz : `` No one in Switzerland ever came so far so fast ... </s>
<s> He was simply the first in this country to realize that treasures were just lying around waiting to be picked up . </s>
<s> In short : Rey found companies with weak earnings but rich assets . '' </s>
<s> However , the Swiss financial press in general , as well as many analysts , have had a hard time making up their minds about Mr. Rey and his un-Swiss ways . </s>
<s> For Switzerland 's most prestigious newspaper , Neue Zuercher Zeitung , Mr. Rey seems destined to remain the `` former Bally raider , '' an image that has proved hard to overcome . </s>
<s> In 1976 , as an upstart in the eyes of Switzerland 's establishment , Mr. Rey laid the foundations of his present-day prominence with an unheard-of raid on Bally , the country 's traditional shoemaker . </s>
<s> Sitting beside a banker at a luncheon in London , where he was working as a financial consultant , he learned that a large packet of Bally 's shares was up for sale . </s>
<s> Looking into Bally , he could hardly believe what he saw : a company with enormous real-estate holdings in major European cities and a market capitalization of 28 million Swiss francs ; it had 7,000 employees . </s>
<s> Investing four million Swiss francs earned from his financial transactions and two million Swiss francs from his parents and his wife , Mr. Rey acquired 20 % of Bally 's shares . </s>
<s> But such tactics were alien to Switzerland in 1976 , and still are n't common because of share restrictions that companies are allowed to maintain . </s>
<s> Eventually , Mr. Rey was forced to sell his Bally shares to the weapons maker Oerlikon-Buehrle Holding AG as establishment pressure grew on this hostile move into the Swiss old boys ' network . </s>
<s> Mr. Rey made 50 million Swiss francs on the sale . </s>
<s> `` Bally was not an unfriendly takeover , '' he insists . </s>
<s> Buying from willing shareholders makes an unfriendly takeover impossible , Mr. Rey contends . </s>
<s> `` I bought from willing shareholders . '' </s>
<s> Nevertheless , Mr. Rey has been very careful since then to make sure his moves are welcome . </s>
<s> And he has worked to shed his raider image . </s>
<s> In 1979 , his career as an industrialist began with the acquisition of the Swiss metals works Selve , based in Thun . </s>
<s> With the nonferrous metals business undermined in Switzerland by tough foreign competition and high domestic costs , this looked like a dull undertaking . </s>
<s> But Mr. Rey brought about a merger in the next few years between the country 's major producers ; the increased efficiency has perked up the industry . </s>
<s> Three years later , machinery producer Ateliers de Constructions Mecaniques de Vevey S.A. was to become part of the Rey empire . </s>
<s> Once again the company 's future looked less than rosy . </s>
<s> But after restructuring under new management , the profits began rolling in . </s>
<s> A major boost to Mr. Rey 's respectability among the Swiss came in 1986 when he sold 60 % of his Phibro Bank to the conservative Swiss cantonal banks . </s>
<s> They renamed it Swiss Cantobank and are using it to expand abroad . </s>
<s> In 1987 , Mr. Rey bested leading publishing houses to take over Switzerland 's Jean Frey AG , a major producer of magazines and newspapers . </s>
<s> And with the recent acquisition of 30 % of Winterthur-based machinery manufacturer Gebrueder Sulzer AG , Mr. Rey has enjoyed the status of white knight . </s>
<s> Sulzer preferred him to financier Tito Tettamanti , whose secretive raid on the company 's stock had led to a bitter battle . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , as such strategic investments have mounted , the merchant-banking arm of Mr. Rey 's Omni Holding has been busily buying and selling dozens of companies , often after a financial or corporate restructuring . </s>
<s> Today , this branch of Mr. Rey 's empire runs under the name Omnicorp Offering Services and handles mergers and acquisitions , placement of securities and real estate . </s>
<s> In its portfolio are such diverse companies as United Kingdom-based Air Europe ; Checkrobot Inc. , a U.S. company that makes supermarket checkout machines ; Norment Industries , a U.S. manufacturer of securities systems ; Com Systems Inc. , a U.S. regional telephone company ; and major real-estate projects in the U.S. and Europe . </s>
<s> For financial analysts , reading Omni 's accounts is a tough challenge . </s>
<s> `` Companies move in and out , '' says Helga Kern of KK Swiss Investment . </s>
<s> Financial analysts note that Mr. Rey is attracted to companies that are undervalued on the basis of their real-estate interests . </s>
<s> In August , Omni unexpectedly bought Inspectorate 's 80 % stake in Harpener AG of West Germany , a land-rich company . </s>
<s> The internal transaction within the Rey empire puzzled Harpener 's small shareholders , but analysts say it makes sense for Inspectorate-Adia to focus on its main businesses of product inspection and temporary help . </s>
<s> Mr. Rey says the move is yet another example of his conservatism . </s>
<s> He explains that companies with real estate give `` security . '' </s>
<s> The real estate can be used , he points out , as guarantees for bank loans for corporate development . </s>
<s> He says he wants to `` influence '' but not `` manage '' companies . </s>
<s> `` I do n't want to be like -LCB- financier Alan -RCB- Bond and the other Australians . </s>
<s> I do n't want companies to be built around me as a person . </s>
<s> I want them to stand alone . </s>
