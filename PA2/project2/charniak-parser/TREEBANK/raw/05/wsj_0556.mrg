<s> Comparable store sales for the quarter were up 7.3 % . </s>
<s> The net loss for the quarter was $ 43.1 million against a year-earlier loss of $ 106 million . </s>
<s> The loss in the fourth quarter of 1988 reflected in part expenses for an unsuccessful bid for Federated Department Stores Inc. , as well as the restructuring of some of its department store operations . </s>
<s> For the year , sales were up 5.6 % to $ 6.97 billion compared with $ 6.61 billion in fiscal 1988 . </s>

<s> The $ 833.6 million figures includes the new acquisitions . </s>

<s> While our competitors are concerned with their financial viability and possible ownership changes , we will be concentrating on buying and selling merchandise our customers need and want . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Finkelstein is apparently referring to B. Altman and Bonwit Teller , two New York retailers that have recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , as well as the retail chains owned by financially troubled Campeau Corp . </s>

<s> `` The volume and profit impact on our fiscal first quarter will not be positive , but looking at the whole fiscal year , we do n't see the effect as material , '' wrote Mr. Finkelstein . </s>
