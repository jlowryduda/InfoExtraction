<s> Investors who bought stock with borrowed money -- that is , `` on margin '' -- may be more worried than most following Friday 's market drop . </s>
<s> That 's because their brokers can require them to sell some shares or put up more cash to enhance the collateral backing their loans . </s>
<s> In October 1987 , these margin calls were thought to have contributed to the downward spiral of the stock market . </s>
<s> Typically , a margin call occurs when the price of a stock falls below 75 % of its original value . </s>
<s> If the investor does n't put up the extra cash to satisfy the call , the brokerage firm may begin liquidating the securities . </s>

<s> Margin calls since Friday `` have been higher than usual , but reasonable , '' a spokesman for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said . </s>

<s> He said Schwab had increased margin requirements `` so customers have more of a cushion . '' </s>
