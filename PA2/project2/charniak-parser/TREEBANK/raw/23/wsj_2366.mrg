<s> Population Drain Ends For Midwestern States </s>
<s> IOWA IS MAKING a comeback . </s>
<s> So are Indiana , Ohio and Michigan . </s>
<s> The population of all four states is on the upswing , according to new Census Bureau estimates , following declines throughout the early 1980s . </s>
<s> The gains , to be sure , are rather small . </s>
<s> Iowa , for instance , saw its population grow by 11,000 people , or 0.4 % , between 1987 and 1988 , the Census Bureau says . </s>
<s> Still , even that modest increase is good news for a state that had n't grown at all since 1981 . </s>
<s> Between 1987 and 1988 , North Dakota was the only state in the Midwest to lose population , a loss of 4,000 people . </s>
<s> Six of the 12 midwestern states have been growing steadily since 1980 -- Illinois , Kansas , Minnesota , Missouri , South Dakota and Wisconsin . </s>
<s> The Northeast has been holding its own in the population race . </s>
<s> Seven of nine states have grown each year since 1980 , including New York , which lost 4 % of its population during the 1970s . </s>
<s> And although Pennsylvania and Massachusetts suffered slight declines earlier in the decade , they are growing again . </s>
<s> At the same time , several states in the South and West have had their own population turnaround . </s>
<s> Seven states that grew in the early 1980s are now losing population -- West Virginia , Mississippi , Louisiana , Oklahoma , Montana , Wyoming and Alaska . </s>
<s> Overall , though , the South and West still outpace the Northeast and Midwest , and fast-growing states like Florida and California ensure that the pattern will continue . </s>
<s> But the growth gap between the Sun Belt and other regions has clearly started narrowing . </s>
<s> More Elderly Maintain Their Independence </s>
<s> THANKS TO modern medicine , more couples are growing old together . </s>
<s> And even after losing a spouse , more of the elderly are staying independent . </s>
<s> A new Census Bureau study of the noninstitutionalized population shows that 64 % of people aged 65 to 74 were living with a spouse in 1988 , up from 59 % in 1970 . </s>
<s> This does n't mean they 're less likely to live alone , however . </s>
<s> That share has remained at about 24 % since 1970 . </s>
<s> What has changed is that more of the young elderly are living with spouses rather than with other relatives , such as children . </s>
<s> In 1988 , 10 % of those aged 65 to 74 lived with relatives other than spouses , down from 15 % in 1970 . </s>
<s> As people get even older , many become widowed . </s>
<s> But even among those aged 75 and older , the share living with a spouse rose slightly , to 40 % in 1988 from 38 % in 1970 . </s>
<s> Like their younger counterparts , the older elderly are less likely to live with other relatives . </s>
<s> Only 17 % of those aged 75 and older lived with relatives other than spouses in 1988 , down from 26 % in 1970 . </s>
<s> The likelihood of living alone beyond the age of 75 has increased to 40 % from 32 % . </s>
<s> More people are remaining independent longer presumably because they are better off physically and financially . </s>
<s> Careers Count Most For the Well-to-Do </s>
<s> MANY AFFLUENT people place personal success and money above family . </s>
<s> At least that 's what a survey by Ernst & Young and Yankelovich , Clancy , Shulman indicates . </s>
<s> Two-thirds of respondents said they strongly felt the need to be successful in their jobs , while fewer than half said they strongly felt the need to spend more time with their families . </s>
<s> Being successful in careers and spending the money they make are top priorities for this group . </s>
<s> Unlike most studies of the affluent market , this survey excluded the super-rich . </s>
<s> Average household income for the sample was $ 194,000 , and average net assets were reported as $ 775,000 . </s>
<s> The goal was to learn about one of today 's fastest-growing income groups , the upper-middle class . </s>
<s> Although they represent only 2 % of the population , they control nearly one-third of discretionary income . </s>
<s> Across the board , these consumers value quality , buy what they like rather than just what they need , and appreciate products that are distinctive . </s>
<s> Despite their considerable incomes and assets , 40 % of the respondents in the study do n't feel financially secure , and one-fourth do n't feel that they have made it . </s>
<s> Twenty percent do n't even feel they are financially well off . </s>
<s> Many of the affluent are n't comfortable with themselves , either . </s>
<s> About 40 % do n't feel they 're more able than others . </s>
<s> While twothirds feel some guilt about being affluent , only 25 % give $ 2,500 or more to charity each year . </s>
<s> Thirty-five percent attend religious services regularly ; at the same time , 60 % feel that in life one sometimes has to compromise one 's principles . </s>
<s> Odds and Ends </s>
<s> THE NUMBER of women and minorities who hold jobs in top management in the nation 's largest banks has more than doubled since 1978 . </s>
<s> The American Bankers Association says that women make up 47 % of officials and managers in the top 50 banks , up from 33 % in 1978 . </s>
<s> The share of minorities in those positions has risen to 16 % from 12 % ... . </s>
<s> Per-capita personal income in the U.S. grew faster than inflation last year , according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis . </s>
<s> The amount of income divvied up for each man , woman and child was $ 16,489 in 1988 , up 6.6 % from $ 15,472 in 1987 . </s>
<s> Per capita personal income ranged from $ 11,116 in Mississippi to $ 23,059 in Connecticut ... . </s>
<s> There are 13.1 million students in college this fall , up 2 % from 1988 , the National Center for Education Statistics estimates . </s>
<s> About 54 % are women , and 44 % are part-time students . </s>
