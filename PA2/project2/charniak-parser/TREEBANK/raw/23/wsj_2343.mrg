<s> The Bronx has a wonderful botanical garden , a great zoo , its own charming Little Italy -LRB- on Arthur Avenue -RRB- and , of course , the Yankees . </s>
<s> However , most people , having been subjected to news footage of the devastated South Bronx , look at the borough the way Tom Wolfe 's Sherman McCoy did in `` Bonfire of the Vanities '' -- as a wrong turn into hell . </s>
<s> But Laura Cunningham 's Bronx , her childhood Bronx of the '50s , is something else altogether . </s>
<s> In a lovely , novelistic memoir , `` Sleeping Arrangements '' -LRB- Knopf , 195 pages , $ 18.95 -RRB- , she remembers an exotic playground , peopled mainly by Jewish eccentrics and the occasional Catholic -LRB- real oddballs like her sexpot friend , the hell-kitten Diana , age five -RRB- . </s>
<s> Ms. Cunningham , a novelist and playwright , has a vivid and dramatically outsized sense of recall . </s>
<s> She transforms her `` Bronx of the emotions , a place where the flats of mediocrity are only relieved by steep descents into hysteria '' into the `` Babylonian Bronx , '' a world simmering with sex and death and intrigue . </s>
<s> In the Babylonian Bronx , Jewish working-class people lived in drab , Soviet-style buildings `` glamorized '' with names like AnaMor Towers -LRB- after owners Anna and Morris Snezak -RRB- , whose lobbies and hallways were decorated with murals of ancient Syrians and Greeks , friezes of Pompeii . </s>
<s> For Ms. Cunningham the architectural discombobulation matched the discrepancy she felt living in the AnaMor Towers as a little girl : `` ... outwardly ordinary , inwardly ornate , owing all inspiration to heathen cultures . '' </s>
<s> Sharp-witted and funny but never mean , she 's a memorialist a bit like Truman Capote , if he 'd been Jewish and female and less bitchy . </s>
<s> Little Lily , as Ms. Cunningham calls herself in the book , really was n't ordinary . </s>
<s> She was raised , for the first eight years , by her mother , Rosie , whom she remembers as a loving liar , who realigned history to explain why Lily 's father did n't live with them . </s>
<s> Rosie reinvented this man , who may or may not have known about his child , as a war hero for Lily 's benefit . </s>
<s> Rosie died young and Lily has remembered her as a romantic figure , who did n't interfere much with her child 's education on the streets . </s>
<s> The games Bronx children played -LRB- holding kids down and stripping them , for example -RRB- seem tame by today 's crack standards , but Ms. Cunningham makes it all sound like a great adventure . </s>
<s> `` Without official knowledge of sex or death , we flirted with both , '' she writes . </s>
<s> She analyzed families by their sleeping arrangements . </s>
<s> Her friend Susan , whose parents kept reminding her she was unwanted , slept on a narrow bed wedged into her parents ' bedroom , as though she were a temporary visitor . </s>
<s> Her friend Diana 's father was a professional thief ; they did n't seem to have any bedrooms at all . </s>
<s> Maybe Lily became so obsessed with where people slept and how because her own arrangements kept shifting . </s>
<s> When Rosie died , her uncles moved in -- and let her make the sleeping and other household arrangements . </s>
<s> They painted the apartment orange , pink and white , according to her instructions . </s>
<s> With loving detail she recalls her Uncle Gabe , an Orthodox Jew and song lyricist -LRB- who rhymed river with liver in a love song -RRB- ; and Uncle Len , a mysterious part-time investigator who looked like Lincoln and carried a change of clothing in a Manila envelope , like an `` undercover President on a good-will mission . '' </s>
<s> They came by their strangeness honestly . </s>
<s> Lily 's grandmother , no cookie baker , excised the heads of disliked relatives from the family album , and lugged around her perennial work-in-progress , `` Philosophy for Women . '' </s>
<s> The book loses some momentum toward the end , when Lily becomes more preoccupied with dating boys and less with her delightfully weird family . </s>
<s> For the most part , though , there 's much pleasure in her saucy , poignant probe into the mysteries of the Babylonian Bronx . </s>
<s> The Bronx also figures in Bruce Jay Friedman 's latest novel , which flashes back to the New York of the '50s . </s>
<s> But both the past and present worlds of `` The Current Climate '' -LRB- Atlantic Monthly Press , 200 pages , $ 18.95 -RRB- feel cramped and static . </s>
<s> For his sixth novel , Mr. Friedman tried to resuscitate the protagonist of his 1972 work , `` About Harry Towns . '' </s>
<s> Harry is now a 57-year-old writer , whose continuing flirtation with drugs and marginal types in Hollywood and New York seems quaintly out-of-synch . </s>
<s> Harry fondly remembers the `` old '' days of the early '70s , when people like his friend Travis would take a psychiatrist on a date to analyze what Travis was doing wrong . </s>
<s> `` An L.A. solution , '' explains Mr. Friedman . </s>
<s> Line by line Mr. Friedman 's weary cynicism can be amusing , especially when he 's riffing on the Hollywood social scheme -- the way people size each other up , immediately canceling the desperate ones who merely almost made it . </s>
<s> Harry has avoided all that by living in a Long Island suburb with his wife , who 's so addicted to soap operas and mystery novels she barely seems to notice when her husband disappears for drug-seeking forays into Manhattan . </s>
<s> But it does n't take too many lines to figure Harry out . </s>
<s> He 's a bore . </s>
