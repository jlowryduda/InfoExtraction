<s> The chemical industry is expected to report that profits eroded in the third quarter because of skidding prices in the commodity end of the business . </s>
<s> Producers of commodity chemicals , the basic chemicals produced in huge volumes for other manufacturers , have seen sharp inventory cutting by buyers . </s>
<s> Once the chief beneficiaries of the industry 's now fading boom , these producers also will be reporting against exceptionally strong performances in the 1988 third quarter . </s>
<s> `` For some of these companies , this will be the first quarter with year-to-year negative comparisons , '' says Leonard Bogner , a chemical industry analyst at Prudential Bache Research . </s>
<s> `` This could be the first of five or six down quarters . '' </s>
<s> Perhaps most prominent , Dow Chemical Co. , which as of midyear had racked up eight consecutive record quarters , is expected to report that profit decreased in the latest quarter from a year earlier , if only by a shade . </s>
<s> Though Dow has aggressively diversified into specialty chemicals and pharmaceuticals , the company still has a big stake in polyethylene , which is used in packaging and housewares . </s>
<s> Analysts ' third-quarter estimates for the Midland , Mich. , company are between $ 3.20 a share and $ 3.30 a share , compared with $ 3.36 a year ago , when profit was $ 632 million on sales of $ 4.15 billion . </s>
<s> A Dow spokeswoman declined to comment on the estimates . </s>
<s> At the investment firm of Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co. , the commodity-chemical segment is seen pulling down overall profit for 20 companies representative of the whole industry by 8 % to 10 % . </s>
<s> `` You will find the commodities off more than the others and the diversified companies about even or slightly better , '' says James Wilbur , a Smith Barney analyst . </s>
<s> First Boston Corp. projects that 10 of the 15 companies it follows will report lower profit . </s>
<s> Most of the 10 have big commodity-chemical operations . </s>
<s> Still , some industry giants are expected to report continuing gains , largely because so much of their business is outside commodity chemicals . </s>
<s> Du Pont Co. is thought to have had steady profit growth in white pigments , fibers and polymers . </s>
<s> Moreover , the Wilmington , Del. , company is helped when prices weaken on the commodity chemicals it buys for its own production needs , such as ethylene . </s>
<s> Analysts are divided over whether Du Pont will report much of a gain in the latest quarter from its Conoco Inc. oil company . </s>
<s> The estimates for Du Pont range from $ 2.25 to $ 2.45 a share . </s>
<s> In the 1988 third quarter , the company earned $ 461 million , or $ 1.91 a share , on sales of $ 7.99 billion . </s>
<s> Du Pont declined to comment . </s>
<s> Monsanto Co. , too , is expected to continue reporting higher profit , even though its sales of crop chemicals were hurt in the latest quarter by drought in northern Europe and the western U.S. . </s>
<s> The St. Louis-based company is expected to report again that losses in its G.D. Searle & Co. pharmaceutical business are narrowing . </s>
<s> Searle continued to operate in the red through the first half of the year , but Monsanto has said it expects Searle to post a profit for all of 1989 . </s>
<s> Most estimates for Monsanto run between $ 1.70 and $ 2 a share . </s>
<s> A year ago , the company posted third-quarter profit of $ 116 million , or $ 1.67 a share , on sales of $ 2.02 billion . </s>
<s> Monsanto declined to comment . </s>
<s> But the commodity-chemical producers are caught on the downside of a pricing cycle . </s>
<s> By some accounts on Wall Street and in the industry , the inventory reductions are near an end , which may presage firmer demand . </s>
<s> But doubters say growing production capacity could keep pressure on prices into the early 1990s . </s>
<s> In the latest quarter , at least , profit is expected to fall sharply . </s>
<s> For Himont Inc. , `` how far down it is , we do n't know , '' says Leslie Ravitz at Salomon Brothers . </s>
<s> The projections are in the neighborhood of 50 cents a share to 75 cents , compared with a restated $ 1.65 a share a year earlier , when profit was $ 107.8 million on sales of $ 435.5 million . </s>
<s> Himont faces lower prices for its mainstay product , polypropylene , while it goes forward with a heavy capital investment program to bolster its raw material supply and develop new uses for polypropylene , whose markets include the packaging and automobile industries . </s>
<s> The company , based in Wilmington , Del. , is 81%-owned by Montedison S.p . A. , Milan , which has an offer outstanding for the Himont shares it does n't already own . </s>
<s> At Quantum Chemical Corp. , New York , the trouble is lower prices for polyethylene , higher debt costs and the idling of an important plant due to an explosion . </s>
<s> Some analysts hedge their estimates for Quantum , because it is n't known when the company will book certain one-time charges . </s>
<s> But the estimates range from break-even to 35 cents a share . </s>
<s> In the 1988 third quarter , Quantum earned $ 99.8 million , or $ 3.92 a share , on sales of $ 724.4 million . </s>
<s> Another big polyethylene producer , Union Carbide Corp. , is expected to post profit of between $ 1 a share and $ 1.25 , compared with $ 1.56 a share a year earlier , when the company earned $ 213 million on sales of $ 2.11 billion . </s>
<s> Himont , Quantum and Union Carbide all declined to comment . </s>
