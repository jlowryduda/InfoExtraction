<s> Call it the `` we 're too broke to fight '' defense . </s>
<s> Lawyers for dozens of insolvent savings and loan associations are trying a new tack in their efforts to defuse suits filed by borrowers , developers and creditors . </s>
<s> The thrifts ' lawyers claim that the suits , numbering 700 to 1,000 in Texas alone , should be dismissed as moot because neither the S&Ls nor the extinct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. has the money to pay judgments . </s>
<s> Though the argument may have a common-sense ring to it , even the S&L lawyers concede there 's little precedent to back their position . </s>
<s> Still , one federal appeals court has signaled it 's willing to entertain the notion , and the lawyers have renewed their arguments in Texas and eight other states where the defense is permitted under state law . </s>
<s> The dismissal of the pending suits could go a long way toward clearing court dockets in Texas and reducing the FSLIC 's massive legal bills , which topped $ 73 million last year . </s>
<s> The S&L lawyers were encouraged last month by an appellate-court ruling in two cases brought against defunct Sunbelt Savings & Loan Association of Dallas by the developers of the Valley Ranch , best known as the training center for the Dallas Cowboys football team . </s>
<s> Sunbelt foreclosed on the ranch . </s>
<s> Sunbelt and the FSLIC argued to the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals `` that there will never be any assets with which to satisfy a judgment against Sunbelt Savings nor any means to collect from any other party , including FSLIC . '' </s>
<s> `` If true , '' the court wrote , `` this contention would justify dismissal of these actions on prudential grounds . '' </s>
<s> But the court said it lacked enough financial information about Sunbelt and the FSLIC and sent the cases back to federal district court in Dallas . </s>
<s> Charles Haworth , a lawyer for Sunbelt , says he plans to file a brief this week urging the district judge to dismiss the suits , because Sunbelt 's liabilities exceeded its assets by about $ 2 billion when federal regulators closed it in August 1988 . </s>
<s> `` This institution is just brain dead , '' says Mr. Haworth , a partner in the Dallas office of Andrews & Kurth , a Houston law firm . </s>
<s> But a lawyer for Triland Investment Group , the developer of Valley Ranch , dismisses such arguments as a `` defense du jour . '' </s>
<s> Attorney Richard Jackson of Dallas says a judgment for Triland could be satisfied in ways other than a monetary award , including the reversal of Sunbelt 's foreclosure on Valley Ranch . </s>
<s> `` We 're asking the court for a number of things he can grant in addition to the thrill of victory , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` We 'd take the Valley Ranch free and clear as a booby prize . </s>
