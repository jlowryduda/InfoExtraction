<s> Earnings for most of the nation 's major pharmaceutical makers are believed to have moved ahead briskly in the third quarter , as companies with newer , big-selling prescription drugs fared especially well . </s>
<s> For the third consecutive quarter , however , most of the companies ' revenues were battered by adverse foreign-currency translations as a result of the strong dollar abroad . </s>
<s> Analysts said that Merck & Co. , Eli Lilly & Co. , Warner-Lambert Co. and the Squibb Corp. unit of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. all benefited from strong sales of relatively new , higher-priced medicines that provide wide profit margins . </s>
<s> Less robust earnings at Pfizer Inc. and Upjohn Co. were attributed to those companies ' older products , many of which face stiffening competition from generic drugs and other medicines . </s>
<s> Joseph Riccardo , an analyst with Bear , Stearns & Co. , said that over the past few years most drug makers have shed their slow-growing businesses and instituted other cost savings , such as consolidating manufacturing plants and administrative staffs . </s>
<s> As a result , `` major new products are having significant impact , even on a company with very large revenues , '' Mr. Riccardo said . </s>
<s> Analysts said profit for the dozen or so big drug makers , as a group , is estimated to have climbed between 11 % and 14 % . </s>
<s> While that 's not spectacular , Neil Sweig , an analyst with Prudential Bache , said that the rate of growth will `` look especially good as compared to other companies if the economy turns downward . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Sweig estimated that Merck 's profit for the quarter rose by about 22 % , propelled by sales of its line-up of fast-growing prescription drugs , including its anti-cholesterol drug , Mevacor ; a high blood pressure medicine , Vasotec ; Primaxin , an antibiotic , and Pepcid , an anti-ulcer medication . </s>
<s> Profit climbed even though Merck 's sales were reduced by `` one to three percentage points '' as a result of the strong dollar , Mr. Sweig said . </s>
<s> In the third quarter of 1988 , Merck earned $ 311.8 million , or 79 cents a share . </s>
<s> In Rahway , N.J. , a Merck spokesman said the company does n't make earnings projections . </s>
<s> Mr. Sweig said he estimated that Lilly 's earnings for the quarter jumped about 20 % , largely because of the performance of its new anti-depressant Prozac . </s>
<s> The drug , introduced last year , is expected to generate sales of about $ 300 million this year . </s>
<s> `` It 's turning out to be a real blockbuster , '' Mr. Sweig said . </s>
<s> In last year 's third quarter , Lilly earned $ 171.4 million , or $ 1.20 a share . </s>
<s> In Indianapolis , Lilly declined comment . </s>
<s> Several analysts said they expected Warner-Lambert 's profit also to increase by more than 20 % from $ 87.7 million , or $ 1.25 a share , it reported in the like period last year . </s>
<s> The company is praised by analysts for sharply lowering its costs in recent years and shedding numerous companies with low profit margins . </s>
<s> The company 's lean operation , analysts said , allowed sharp-rising sales from its cholesterol drug , Lopid , to power earnings growth . </s>
<s> Lopid sales are expected to be about $ 300 million this year , up from $ 190 million in 1988 . </s>
<s> In Morris Plains , N.J. , a spokesman for the company said the analysts ' projections are `` in the ballpark . '' </s>
<s> Squibb 's profit , estimated by analysts to be about 18 % above the $ 123 million , or $ 1.25 a share , it earned in the third quarter of 1988 , was the result of especially strong sales of its Capoten drug for treating high blood pressure and other heart disease . </s>
<s> The company was officially merged with Bristol-Myers Co. earlier this month . </s>
<s> Bristol-Myers declined to comment . </s>
<s> Mr. Riccardo of Bear Stearns said that Schering-Plough Corp. 's expected profit rise of about 18 % to 20 % , and Bristol-Meyers 's expected profit increase of about 13 % are largely because `` those companies are really managed well . '' </s>
<s> ScheringPlough earned $ 94.4 million , or 84 cents a share , while Bristol-Myers earned $ 232.3 million , or 81 cents a share , in the like period a year earlier . </s>
<s> In Madison , N.J. , a spokesman for Schering-Plough said the company has `` no problems '' with the average estimate by a analysts that third-quarter earnings per share rose by about 19 % , to $ 1 . </s>
<s> The company expects to achieve the 20 % increase in full-year earnings per share , as it projected in the spring , the spokesman said . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , analysts said Pfizer 's recent string of lackluster quarterly performances continued , as earnings in the quarter were expected to decline by about 5 % . </s>
<s> Sales of Pfizer 's important drugs , Feldene for treating arthritis , and Procardia , a heart medicine , have shrunk because of increased competition . </s>
<s> `` The -LRB- strong -RRB- dollar hurt Pfizer a lot , too , '' Mr. Sweig said . </s>
<s> In the third quarter last year , Pfizer earned $ 216.8 million , or $ 1.29 a share . </s>
<s> In New York , the company declined comment . </s>
<s> Analysts said they expected Upjohn 's profit to be flat or rise by only about 2 % to 4 % as compared with $ 89.6 million , or 49 cents a share , it earned a year ago . </s>
<s> Upjohn 's biggest-selling drugs are Xanax , a tranquilizer , and Halcion , a sedative . </s>
<s> Sales of both drugs have been hurt by new state laws restricting the prescriptions of certain tranquilizing medicines and adverse publicity about the excessive use of the drugs . </s>
<s> Also , the company 's hair-growing drug , Rogaine , is selling well -- at about $ 125 million for the year , but the company 's profit from the drug has been reduced by Upjohn 's expensive print and television campaigns for advertising , analysts said . </s>
<s> In Kalamazoo , Mich. , Upjohn declined comment . </s>
