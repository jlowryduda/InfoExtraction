<s> On a recent Saturday night , in the midst of West Germany 's most popular prime-time show , a contestant bet the host that she could name any of 100 different cheeses after just one nibble , while blindfolded . </s>
<s> The woman won the bet . </s>
<s> But perhaps even more remarkable , the three-hour-show , `` Wetten Dass '' -LRB- Make a Bet -RRB- , regularly wins the top slot in the country 's TV ratings , sometimes drawing as many as 50 % of West German households . </s>
<s> As the 1992 economic integration approaches , Europe 's cultural curators have taken to the ramparts against American `` cultural imperialism , '' threatening to impose quotas against such pop invaders as `` Dallas , '' `` Miami Vice '' and `` L.A. Law . '' </s>
<s> But much of what the Europeans want to protect seems every bit as cheesy as what they are trying to keep out . </s>
<s> The most militant opposition to American TV imports has come from French television and movie producers , who have demanded quotas ensuring that a full 60 % of Europe 's TV shows be produced in Europe . </s>
<s> So far , the French have failed to win enough broad-based support to prevail . </s>
<s> A glance through the television listings and a few twists of the European television dial suggest one reason why . </s>
<s> While there are some popular action and drama series , few boast the high culture and classy production values one might expect . </s>
<s> More European air time is filled with low-budget game shows , variety hours , movies and talk shows , many of which are authorized knock-offs of their American counterparts . </s>
<s> One of France 's most popular Saturday night programs features semi-celebrities seeking out their grammar-school classmates for on-air reunions . </s>
<s> A Flemish game show has as its host a Belgian pretending to be Italian . </s>
<s> One of Italy 's favorite shows , `` Fantastico , '' a tepid variety show , is so popular that viewers clamored to buy a chocolate product , `` Cacao Fantastico , '' whose praises were sung each week by dancing showgirls -- even though the product did n't exist . </s>
<s> Topping the cheese stunt , on another typical evening of fun on `` Wetten Dass , '' a contestant won a bet with the show 's host , Thomas Gottschalk , that he could identify 300 German dialects over the telephone . </s>
<s> A celebrity guest , U.S. Ambassador to West Germany Richard Burt , also won a bet that someone could pile up $ 150 worth of quarters on a slanted coin . </s>
<s> Mr. Burt nonetheless paid the penalty as if he had lost , agreeing to spend a day with West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher frying and selling their combined weight in potato pancakes . </s>
<s> If this seems like pretty weak stuff around which to raise the protectionist barriers , it may be because these shows need all the protection they can get . </s>
<s> European programs usually target only their own local audience , and often only a small portion of that . </s>
<s> Mega-hits in Germany or Italy rarely make it even to France or Great Britain , and almost never show up on U.S. screens . </s>
<s> Attempts to produce `` pan-European '' programs have generally resulted in disappointment . </s>
<s> One annual co-production , the three-hour-long `` Eurovision Song Contest , '' featuring soft-rock songs from each of 20 European countries , has been described as the world 's most boring TV show . </s>
<s> Another , `` Jeux Sans Frontieres , '' where villagers from assorted European countries make fools of themselves performing pointless tasks , is a hit in France . </s>
<s> A U.S.-made imitation under the title `` Almost Anything Goes '' flopped fast . </s>
<s> For the most part , what 's made here stays here , and for good reason . </s>
<s> The cream of the British crop , the literary dramas that are shown on U.S. public television as `` Masterpiece Theater , '' make up a relatively small part of British air time . </s>
<s> Most British programming is more of an acquired taste . </s>
<s> There is , for instance , `` One Man and His Dog , '' a herding contest among sheep dogs . </s>
<s> Also riveting to the British are hours of dart-throwing championships , even more hours of lawn bowling contests and still more hours of snooker marathons . </s>
<s> European drama has had better , though still mixed , fortunes . </s>
<s> The most popular such shows focus on narrow national concerns . </s>
<s> A French knock-off of `` Dallas , '' called `` Chateauvallon '' and set in a French vineyard , had a good run in France , which ended after the female lead was injured in a real-life auto accident . </s>
<s> `` Schwarzwaldklinik , '' -LRB- Black Forest Clinic -RRB- , a kind of German `` St . Elsewhere '' set in a health spa , is popular in Germany , and has spread into France . </s>
<s> Italy 's most popular series is a drama called `` La Piovra , '' or `` The Octopus , '' which chronicles the fight of an idealistic young investigator in Palermo against the Mafia . </s>
<s> It was front-page news in Italy earlier this year when the fictional inspector was gunned down in the series . </s>
<s> Spain 's most popular mini-series this year was `` Juncal , '' the story of an aging bullfighter . </s>
<s> `` The trend is pretty well established now that local programs are the most popular , with American programs second , '' says Brian Wenham , a former director of programs for the British Broadcasting Corp . </s>
<s> `` Given a choice , everybody will watch a home-produced show . '' </s>
<s> But frequently there is n't much choice . </s>
<s> Thus , Europe has begun the recent crusade to produce more worthy shows of its own , programs with broader appeal . </s>
<s> `` We 've basically got to start from scratch , to train writers and producers to make shows that other people will want to see , '' concedes Colin Young , head of Britain 's National Film Theatre School . </s>
<s> While some in the U.S. contend that advertising is the bane of television , here many believe that its absence is to blame for the European TV industry 's sluggish development . </s>
<s> Until recently , national governments in Europe controlled most of the air time and allowed little or no advertising . </s>
<s> Since production costs were guaranteed , it did n't matter that a program could n't be sold abroad or put into syndication , as most American programs are . </s>
<s> But not much money was spent on the shows , either , a situation that encouraged cheap-to-make talk and game shows , while discouraging expensive-to-produce dramas . </s>
<s> Now , however , commercial channels are coming to most European countries , and at the same time , satellite and cable technology is spreading rapidly . </s>
<s> Just last week , Greece authorized two commercial channels for the first time ; Spain earlier began to allow commercial television alongside its state channels . </s>
<s> The result is a new and huge appetite for programming . </s>
<s> But perhaps to the consternation of those calling for quotas , most of this void is likely to be filled with the cheapest and most plentiful programming now available -- reruns -- usually of shows made in the U.S. . </s>
<s> Sky Channel , a British-based venture of Australian-American press tycoon Rupert Murdoch , offers what must be a baffling cultural mix to most of its audience . </s>
<s> The financially struggling station offers programs obviously made available cheaply from its boss 's other ventures . </s>
<s> In a Madrid hotel room recently , a viewer caught the end of a badly acted series about a fishing boat on Australia 's Great Barrier Reef , only to be urged by the British announcer to `` stay tuned for the further adventures of Skippy the Kangaroo . '' </s>
