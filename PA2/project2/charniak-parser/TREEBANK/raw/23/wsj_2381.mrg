<s> Pension funds , insurers and other behemoths of the investing world said they began scooping up stocks during Friday 's market rout . </s>
<s> And they plan to buy more today . </s>
<s> Rightly or wrongly , many giant institutional investors appear to be fighting the latest war by applying the lesson they learned in the October 1987 crash : Buying at the bottom pays off . </s>
<s> To be sure , big investors might put away their checkbooks in a hurry if stocks open sharply lower today . </s>
<s> They could still panic and bail out of the market . </s>
<s> But their 1987 performance indicates that they wo n't abandon stocks unless conditions get far worse . </s>
<s> `` Last time , we got rewarded for going out and buying stocks when the panic was the worst , '' said John W. Rogers , president of Chicago-based Ariel Capital Management Inc. , which manages $ 1.1 billion of stocks . </s>
<s> Mr. Rogers spent half his cash on hand Friday for `` our favorite stocks that have fallen apart . '' </s>
<s> He expects to invest the rest if the market weakens further . </s>
<s> Denver-based portfolio manager James Craig was n't daunted when Friday 's rout shaved $ 40 million from the value of the $ 752 million Janus Fund he oversees . </s>
<s> `` I waited to make sure all the program trades had kicked through , '' he said . </s>
<s> Then he jumped into the market : </s>
<s> `` I spent $ 30 million in the last half-hour . '' </s>
<s> Other money managers also opened their wallets . </s>
<s> `` I was buying at the close -LRB- Friday -RRB- and I 'll be buying again because I know we 're getting good value , '' said Frederick A. Moran , president of Moran Asset Management Inc. , Greenwich , Conn . </s>
<s> `` There is no justification on the fundamental level for this crash . '' </s>
<s> Unlike mutual funds , which can be forced to sell stockholdings when investors rush to withdraw money , big investors such as pension funds and insurance companies can decide to ride out market storms without jettisoning stock . </s>
<s> Most often , they do just that , because stocks have proved to be the best-performing long-term investment , attracting about $ 1 trillion from pension funds alone . </s>
<s> `` If you bought after the crash , you did very very well off the bottom , '' said Stephen B. Timbers , chief investment officer of Chicago-based Kemper Financial Services Inc . </s>
<s> The $ 56 billion California Public Employees Retirement System , for one , added $ 1 billion to its stock portfolio two years ago . </s>
<s> `` The last crash taught institutional investors that they have to be long-term holders , and that they ca n't react to short-term events , good or bad , '' said Stephen L. Nesbitt , senior vice president for the pension consultants Wilshire Associates in Santa Monica , Calif . </s>
<s> `` Those that pulled out -LRB- of stocks -RRB- regretted it , '' he said , `` so I doubt you 'll see any significant changes '' in institutional portfolios as a result of Friday 's decline . </s>
<s> Stocks , as measured by the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index , have been stellar performers this year , rising 27.97 % before Friday 's plunge , excluding dividends . </s>
<s> Even Friday 's slump leaves investors ahead more than 20 % , well above the annual average for stocks over several decades . </s>
<s> `` You could go down 400 points and still have a good year in the market , '' said James D. Awad , president of New York-based BMI Capital Corp . </s>
<s> Mr. Awad , however , worries that the market `` could go down 800 or 900 points in the next few days . </s>
<s> It can happen before you can turn around . '' </s>
<s> He said he discerns many parallels with 1987 , including the emphasis on takeover stocks and the re-emergence of computerized program trading . </s>
<s> `` The only thing you do n't have , '' he said , `` is the ` portfolio insurance ' phenomenon overlaid on the rest . '' </s>
<s> Most institutional investors have abandoned the portfolio insurance hedging technique , which is widely thought to have worsened the 1987 crash . </s>
<s> Not really insurance , this tactic was designed to soften the blow of declining stock prices and generate an offsetting profit by selling waves of S&P futures contracts . </s>
<s> In its severest test , the $ 60 billion of portfolio insurance in effect in the 1987 crash did n't work , as stock buyers disappeared and stock and futures prices became disconnected . </s>
<s> Even without portfolio insurance , market conditions were grim Friday , money managers said . </s>
<s> Neil Weisman , whose New York-based Chilmark Capital Partners had converted 85 % of its $ 220 million investment pool to cash in recent months , said he was besieged by Wall Street firms Friday asking him to take stock off their hands . </s>
<s> `` We got calls from big block houses asking us if we want to make bids on anything , '' said Mr. Weisman , who , happy with his returns on investments chalked up earlier , declined the offers . </s>
<s> Mr. Weisman predicts stocks will appear to stabilize in the next few days before declining again , trapping more investors . </s>
<s> `` I think it will be a rigor mortis rally , '' he said . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , Friday brought a reprieve for money managers whose investment styles had put them at odds with the market rally . </s>
<s> Especially gleeful were the short sellers , who have been pounded by this year 's market climb . </s>
<s> The shorts sell borrowed shares , hoping to profit by replacing them later at a lower price . </s>
<s> The nation 's largest short-selling operation is Feshbach Brothers , Palo Alto , Calif. , which said last May that its short positions had shown losses of 10 % for the year up to that point . </s>
<s> All that now has changed . </s>
<s> `` We 're ahead for the year because of Friday , '' said the firm 's Kurt Feshbach . </s>
<s> `` We 're not making a killing , but we had a good day . </s>
