<s> The oil industry 's middling profits could persist through the rest of the year . </s>
<s> Major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago , largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability . </s>
<s> The gasoline picture may improve this quarter , but chemicals are likely to remain weak , industry executives and analysts say , reducing chances that profits could equal their year-earlier performance . </s>
<s> The industry is `` seeing a softening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in petrochemicals , '' Glenn Cox , president of Phillips Petroleum Co. , said in an interview . </s>
<s> `` That change will obviously impact third and fourth quarter earnings '' for the industry in general , he added . </s>
<s> He did n't forecast Phillips 's results . </s>
<s> But securities analysts say Phillips will be among the companies hard-hit by weak chemical prices and will probably post a drop in third-quarter earnings . </s>
<s> So , too , many analysts predict , will Exxon Corp. , Chevron Corp. and Amoco Corp . </s>
<s> Typical is what happened to the price of ethylene , a major commodity chemical produced in vast amounts by many oil companies . </s>
<s> It has plunged 13 % since July to around 26 cents a pound . </s>
<s> A year ago ethylene sold for 33 cents , peaking at about 34 cents last December . </s>
<s> A big reason for the chemical price retreat is overexpansion . </s>
<s> Beginning in mid-1987 , prices began accelerating as a growing U.S. economy and the weak dollar spurred demand . </s>
<s> Companies added capacity furiously . </s>
<s> Now , greatly increased supplies are on the market , while the dollar is stronger , and domestic economic growth is slower . </s>
<s> Third-quarter profits from gasoline were weaker . </s>
<s> `` Refining margins were so good in the third quarter of last year and generally not very good this year , '' said William Randol , a securities analyst at First Boston Corp . </s>
<s> Oil company refineries ran flat out to prepare for a robust holiday driving season in July and August that did n't materialize . </s>
<s> The excess supply pushed gasoline prices down in that period . </s>
<s> In addition , crude oil prices were up some from a year earlier , further pressuring profitability . </s>
<s> Refiners say margins picked up in September , and many industry officials believe gasoline profits will rebound this quarter , though still not to the level of 1988 's fourth quarter . </s>
<s> During the 1988 second half , many companies posted record gasoline and chemical profits . </s>
<s> Crude oil production may turn out to be the most surprising element of companies ' earnings this year . </s>
<s> Prices -- averaging roughly $ 2 a barrel higher in the third quarter than a year earlier -- have stayed well above most companies ' expectations . </s>
<s> Demand has been much stronger than anticipated , and it typically accelerates in the fourth quarter . </s>
<s> `` We could see higher oil prices this year , '' said Bryan Jacoboski , an analyst at PaineWebber Inc . </s>
<s> That will translate into sharply higher production profits , particularly compared with last year when oil prices steadily fell to below $ 13 a barrel in the fourth quarter . </s>
<s> While oil prices have been better than expected , natural gas prices have been worse . </s>
<s> In the third quarter , they averaged about 5 % less than they were in 1988 . </s>
<s> The main reason remains weather . </s>
<s> Last summer was notable for a heat wave and drought that caused utilities to burn more natural gas to feed increased electrical demand from air conditioning use . </s>
<s> This summer , on the other hand , had milder weather than usual . </s>
<s> `` We 've been very disappointed in the performance of natural gas prices , '' said Mr. Cox , Phillips 's president . </s>
<s> `` The lagging gas price is not going to assist fourth quarter performance as many had expected . '' </s>
<s> Going into the fourth quarter , natural gas prices are anywhere from 8 % to 17 % lower than a year earlier . </s>
<s> For instance , natural gas currently produced along the Gulf Coast is selling on the spot market for around $ 1.47 a thousand cubic feet , down 13 % from $ 1.69 a thousand cubic feet a year ago . </s>
