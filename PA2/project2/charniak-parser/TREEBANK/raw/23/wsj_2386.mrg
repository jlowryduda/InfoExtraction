<s> Small investors matched their big institutional brethren in anxiety over the weekend , but most seemed to be taking a philosophical approach and said they were resigned to riding out the latest storm in the stock market . </s>
<s> `` I 'm not losing faith in the market , '' said Boston lawyer Christopher Sullivan as he watched the market plunge on a big screen in front of a brokerage firm . </s>
<s> But he 's not so sure about everyone else . </s>
<s> `` I think on Monday the small -LRB- investors -RRB- are going to panic and sell , '' predicted Mr. Sullivan , whose investments include AMR Corp. 's American Airlines unit and several mutual funds . </s>
<s> `` And I think institutions are going to come in and buy ... </s>
<s> I 'm going to hold on . </s>
<s> If I sell now , I 'll take a big loss . '' </s>
<s> Some evinced an optimism that had been rewarded when they did n't flee the market in 1987 . </s>
<s> `` Oh , I bet it 'll be up 50 points on Monday , '' said Lucy Crump , a 78-year-old retired housewife in Lexington , Ky . </s>
<s> Mrs. Crump said her Ashwood Investment Club 's portfolio lost about one-third of its value following the Black Monday crash , `` but no one got discouraged , and we gained that back -- and more . '' </s>
<s> At the annual congress of the National Association of Investors Corp. at the Hyatt Regency hotel in Minneapolis , the scene was calm . </s>
<s> Some 500 investors representing investor clubs from around the U.S. were attending when the market started to slide Friday . </s>
<s> But Robert Showalter , an official of the association , said no special bulletins or emergency meetings of the investors ' clubs are planned . </s>
<s> In fact , some of the association 's members -- long-term , buy-and-hold investors -- welcomed the drop in prices . </s>
<s> `` We hope to take advantage of it , '' said John Snyder , a member of a Los Angeles investors ' club . </s>
<s> He has four stocks in mind to buy if the prices drop to the level he wants . </s>
<s> Not everyone is reacting so calmly , however , and many wonder about the long-term implications of what is widely viewed as the cause of Friday 's slide , reluctance by banks to provide financing for a buy-out of UAL Corp. , parent of United Airlines . </s>
<s> Marc Perkins , a Tampa , Fla. , investment banker , said the market drop is one of `` a tremendous number of signs that the leveraged take-out era is ending . </s>
<s> There 's no question that there 's a general distaste for leverage among lenders . </s>
<s> '' Mr. Perkins believes , however , that the market could be stabilized if California investor Marvin Davis steps back in to the United bidding with an offer of $ 275 a share . </s>
<s> Sara Albert , a 34-year-old Dallas law student , says she 's generally skittish about the stock market and the takeover activity that seems to fuel it . </s>
<s> `` I have this feeling that it 's built on sand , '' she says , that the market rises `` but there 's no foundation to it . '' </s>
<s> She and her husband pulled most of their investments out of the market after the 1987 crash , although she still owns some Texaco stock . </s>
<s> Partly because of concern about the economy and partly because she recently quit her job as a legal assistant to go to school , `` I think at this point we want to be a lot more liquid . '' </s>
<s> Others wonder how many more of these shocks the small investor can stand . </s>
<s> `` We all assumed October '87 was a one-time shot , '' said San Francisco attorney David Greenberg . </s>
<s> `` We told the little guy it could only happen once in a lifetime , come on back . </s>
<s> Now it 's happening again . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Greenberg got out just before the 1987 crash and , to his regret , never went back even as the market soared . </s>
<s> This time he 's ready to buy in `` when the panic wears off . '' </s>
<s> Still , he adds : `` We ca n't have this kind of thing happen very often . </s>
<s> When the little guy gets frightened , the big guys hurt badly . </s>
<s> Merrill Lynch ca n't survive without the little guy . '' </s>
<s> Small investors have tiptoed back into the market following Black Monday , but mostly through mutual funds . </s>
<s> Discount brokerage customers `` have been in the market somewhat but not whole hog like they were two years ago , '' says Leslie Quick Jr. , chairman of the Quick & Reilly discount brokerage firm . </s>
<s> Hugo Quackenbush , senior vice president at Charles Scwhab Corp. , says Schwab customers `` have been neutral to cautious recently about stocks . '' </s>
<s> Individual investors are still angry about program trading , Mr. Quackenbush says . </s>
<s> Avner Arbel , a Cornell University finance professor , says government regulators will have to more closely control program trading to `` win back the confidence of the small investor . '' </s>
<s> But it 's not only the stock market that has some small investors worried . </s>
<s> Alan Helfman , general sales manager of a Chrysler dealership in Houston , said he and his mother have some joint stock investments , but the overall economy is his chief worry . </s>
<s> `` These high rollers took a big bath today , '' he said in his showroom , which is within a few miles of the multi-million dollar homes of some of Houston 's richest citizens . </s>
<s> `` And I can tell you that a high roller is n't going to come in tomorrow and buy a Chrysler TC by Maserati . '' </s>
<s> And , finally , there were the gloaters . </s>
<s> `` I got out in 1987 . </s>
<s> Everything , '' said Pascal Antori , an Akron , Ohio , plumbing contractor who was visiting Chicago and stopped by Fidelity Investments ' LaSalle Street office . </s>
<s> `` I just stopped by to see how much I would have lost . '' </s>
<s> Would Mr. Antori ever get back in ? </s>
<s> `` Are you kidding ! </s>
<s> When it comes to money : Once bitten , 2,000 times shy . </s>
