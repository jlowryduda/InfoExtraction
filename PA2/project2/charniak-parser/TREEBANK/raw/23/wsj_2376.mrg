<s> Just when it seemed safe to go back into stocks , Wall Street suffered another severe attack of nerves . </s>
<s> Does this signal another Black Monday is coming ? </s>
<s> Or is this an extraordinary buying opportunity , just like Oct. 19 , 1987 , eventually turned out to be ? </s>
<s> Here 's what several leading market experts and money managers say about Friday 's action , what happens next and what investors should do . </s>
<s> Joseph Granville . </s>
<s> `` I 'm the only one who said there would be an October massacre , all through late August and September , '' says Mr. Granville , once a widely followed market guru and still a well-known newsletter writer . </s>
<s> `` Everyone will tell you that this time is different from 1987 , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` Well , in some ways it is different , but technically it is just the same . </s>
<s> If you 're a technician , you obey the signals . </s>
<s> Right now they 're telling me to get the hell out and stay out . </s>
<s> I see no major support until 2200 . </s>
<s> I see a possibility of going to 2200 this month . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Granville says he would n't even think of buying until at least 600 to 700 stocks have hit 52-week lows ; about 100 stocks hit new lows Friday . </s>
<s> `` Most people , '' he says , `` have no idea what a massacre pattern looks like . '' </s>
<s> Elaine Garzarelli . </s>
<s> A quantitative analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. , Ms. Garzarelli had warned clients to take their money out of the market before the 1987 crash . </s>
<s> Friday 's big drop , she says , `` was not a crash . </s>
<s> This was an October massacre '' like those that occurred in 1978 and 1979 . </s>
<s> Now , as in those two years , her stock market indicators are positive . </s>
<s> So she thinks the damage will be short-lived and contained . </s>
<s> `` Those corrections lasted one to four weeks and took the market 10%-12 % down , '' she says . </s>
<s> `` This is exactly the same thing , as far as I 'm concerned . '' </s>
<s> Thus , she says , if the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped below 2450 , `` It would just be a fluke . </s>
<s> My advice is to buy . '' </s>
<s> As she calculates it , the average stock now sells for about 12.5 times companies ' earnings . </s>
<s> She says that ratio could climb to 14.5 , given current interest rates , and still be within the range of `` fair value . '' </s>
<s> Ned Davis . </s>
<s> Friday 's fall marks the start of a bear market , says Mr. Davis , president of Ned Davis Research Inc . </s>
<s> But Mr. Davis , whose views are widely respected by money managers , says he expects no 1987-style crash . </s>
<s> `` There was a unique combination in 1987 , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` Margin debt was at a record high . </s>
<s> There was tremendous public enthusiasm for stock mutual funds . </s>
<s> The main thing was portfolio insurance , '' a mechanical trading system intended to protect an investor against losses . `` </s>
<s> A hundred billion dollars in stock was subject '' to it . </s>
<s> In 1987 , such selling contributed to a snowball effect . </s>
<s> Today could even be an up day , Mr. Davis says , if major brokerage firms agree to refrain from program trading . </s>
<s> Over the next several months , though , he says things look bad . </s>
<s> `` I think the market will be heading down into November , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` We will probably have a year-end rally , and then go down again . </s>
<s> Sort of a two-step bear market . '' </s>
<s> He expects the downturn to carry the Dow Jones Industrial Average down to around 2000 sometime next year . </s>
<s> `` That would be a normal bear market , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` I guess that 's my forecast . '' </s>
<s> Leon G. Cooperman . </s>
<s> `` I do n't think the market is going through another October '87 . </s>
<s> I do n't think that 's the case at all , '' says Mr. Cooperman , a partner at Goldman , Sachs & Co. and chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management . </s>
<s> Mr. Cooperman sees this as a good time to pick up bargains , but he does n't think there 's any need to rush . </s>
<s> `` I expect the market to open weaker Monday , but then it should find some stability . '' </s>
<s> He ticks off several major differences between now and two years ago . </s>
<s> Unlike 1987 , interest rates have been falling this year . </s>
<s> Unlike 1987 , the dollar has been strong . </s>
<s> And unlike 1987 , the economy does n't appear to be in any danger of overheating . </s>
<s> But the economy 's slower growth this year also means the outlook for corporate profits `` is n't good , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` So it 's a very mixed bag . '' </s>
<s> Thus , he concludes , `` This is not a good environment to be fully invested '' in stocks . </s>
<s> `` If I had come into Friday on margin or with very little cash in the portfolios , I would not do any buying . </s>
<s> But we came into Friday with a conservative portfolio , so I would look to do some modest buying '' on behalf of clients . `` </s>
<s> We 're going to look for some of the better-known companies that got clocked '' Friday . </s>
<s> John Kenneth Galbraith . </s>
<s> `` This is the latest manifestation of the capacity of the financial community for recurrent insanity , '' says Mr. Galbraith , an economist . </s>
<s> `` I see this as a reaction to the whole junk bond explosion , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` The explosion of junk bonds and takeovers has lodged a lot of insecure securities in the hands of investors and loaded the corporations that are the objects of takeovers or feared takeovers with huge amounts of debt rather than equity . </s>
<s> This has both made investors uneasy and the corporations more vulnerable . '' </s>
<s> Nevertheless , he says a depression does n't appear likely . </s>
<s> `` There is more resiliency in the economy at large than we commonly suppose , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` It takes more error now to have a major depression than back in the Thirties -- much as the financial community and the government may try . '' </s>
<s> Mario Gabelli . </s>
<s> New York money manager Mario Gabelli , an expert at spotting takeover candidates , says that takeovers are n't totally gone . </s>
<s> `` Companies are still going to buy companies around the world , '' he says . </s>
<s> Examples are `` Ford looking at Jaguar , BellSouth looking at LIN Broadcasting . '' </s>
<s> These sorts of takeovers do n't require junk bonds or big bank loans to finance them , so Mr. Gabelli figures they will continue . </s>
<s> `` The market was up 35 % since -LCB- President -RCB- Bush took office , '' Mr. Gabelli says , so a correction was to be expected . </s>
<s> He thinks another crash is `` unlikely , '' and says he was `` nibbling at '' selected stocks during Friday 's plunge . </s>
<s> `` Stocks that were thrown out just on an emotional basis are a great opportunity -LCB- this -RCB- week for guys like me , '' he says . </s>
<s> Jim Rogers . </s>
<s> `` It seems to me that this is the pin that has finally pricked the balloon , '' says Mr. Rogers , a professor of finance at Columbia University and former co-manager of one of the most successful hedge funds in history , Quantum Fund . </s>
<s> He sees `` economic problems , financial problems '' ahead for the U.S. , with a fairly strong possibility of a recession . </s>
<s> `` Friday you could n't sell dollars , '' he says . </s>
<s> Dealers `` would give you a quote , but then refuse to make the trade . '' </s>
<s> If the dollar stays weak , he says , that will add to inflationary pressures in the U.S. and make it hard for the Federal Reserve Board to ease interest rates very much . </s>
<s> Mr. Rogers wo n't decide what to do today until he sees how the London and Tokyo markets go . </s>
<s> He recommends that investors sell takeover-related stocks , but hang on to some other stocks -- especially utilities , which often do well during periods of economic weakness . </s>
<s> Frank Curzio . </s>
<s> Many people now claim to have predicted the 1987 crash . </s>
<s> Queens newsletter writer Francis X. Curzio actually did it : He stated in writing in September 1987 that the Dow Jones Industrial Average was likely to decline about 500 points the following month . </s>
<s> Mr. Curzio says what happens now will depend a good deal on the Federal Reserve Board . </s>
<s> If it promptly cuts the discount rate it charges on loans to banks , he says , `` That could quiet things down . '' </s>
<s> If not , `` We could go to 2200 very soon . '' </s>
<s> Frank W. Terrizzi . </s>
<s> Stock prices `` would still have to go down some additional amount before we become positive on stocks , '' says Mr. Terrizzi , president and managing director of Renaissance Investment Management Inc. in Cincinnati . </s>
<s> Renaissance , which manages about $ 1.8 billion , drew stiff criticism from many clients earlier this year because it pulled entirely out of stocks at the beginning of the year and thus missed a strong rally . </s>
<s> Renaissance is keeping its money entirely in cash equivalents , primarily U.S. Treasury bills . </s>
<s> `` T-bills probably are the right place to be , '' he says . </s>
