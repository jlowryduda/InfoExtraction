<s> When the price of plastics took off in 1987 , Quantum Chemical Corp. went along for the ride . </s>
<s> The timing of Quantum 's chief executive officer , John Hoyt Stookey , appeared to be nothing less than inspired , because he had just increased Quantum 's reliance on plastics . </s>
<s> The company outpaced much of the chemical industry as annual profit grew fivefold in two years . </s>
<s> Mr. Stookey said of the boom , `` It 's going to last a whole lot longer than anybody thinks . '' </s>
<s> But now prices have nose-dived and Quantum 's profit is plummeting . </s>
<s> Some securities analysts are looking for no better than break-even results from the company for the third quarter , compared with year-earlier profit of $ 99.8 million , or $ 3.92 a share , on sales of $ 724.4 million . </s>
<s> The stock , having lost nearly a quarter of its value since Sept. 1 , closed at $ 34.375 share , down $ 1.125 , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday . </s>
<s> To a degree , Quantum represents the new times that have arrived for producers of the so-called commodity plastics that pervade modern life . </s>
<s> Having just passed through one of the most profitable periods in their history , these producers now see their prices eroding . </s>
<s> Pricing cycles , to be sure , are nothing new for plastics producers . </s>
<s> And the financial decline of some looks steep only in comparison with the heady period that is just behind them . </s>
<s> `` We were all wonderful heroes last year , '' says an executive at one of Quantum 's competitors . </s>
<s> `` Now we 're at the bottom of the heap . '' </s>
<s> At Quantum , which is based in New York , the trouble is magnified by the company 's heavy dependence on plastics . </s>
<s> Once known as National Distillers & Chemical Corp. , the company exited the wine and spirits business and plowed more of its resources into plastics after Mr. Stookey took the chief executive 's job in 1986 . </s>
<s> Mr. Stookey , 59 years old , declined to be interviewed for this article , but he has consistently argued that over the long haul -- across both the peaks and the troughs of the plastics market -- Quantum will prosper through its new direction . </s>
<s> Quantum 's lot is mostly tied to polyethylene resin , used to make garbage bags , milk jugs , housewares , toys and meat packaging , among other items . </s>
<s> In the U.S. polyethylene market , Quantum has claimed the largest share , about 20 % . </s>
<s> But its competitors -- including Dow Chemical Co. , Union Carbide Corp. and several oil giants -- have much broader business interests and so are better cushioned against price swings . </s>
<s> When the price of polyethylene moves a mere penny a pound , Quantum 's annual profit fluctuates by about 85 cents a share , provided no other variables are changing . </s>
<s> In recent months the price of polyethylene , even more than that of other commodity plastics , has taken a dive . </s>
<s> Benchmark grades , which still sold for as much as 50 cents a pound last spring , have skidded to between 35 cents and 40 cents . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , the price of ethylene , the chemical building block of polyethylene , has n't dropped nearly so fast . </s>
<s> That discrepancy hurts Quantum badly , because its own plants cover only about half of its ethylene needs . </s>
<s> By many accounts , an early hint of a price rout in the making came at the start of this year . </s>
<s> China , which had been putting in huge orders for polyethylene , abruptly halted them . </s>
<s> Calculating that excess polyethylene would soon be sloshing around the world , other buyers then bet that prices had peaked and so began to draw down inventories rather than order new product . </s>
<s> Kenneth Mitchell , director of Dow 's polyethylene business , says producers were surprised to learn how much inventories had swelled throughout the distribution chain as prices spiraled up . </s>
<s> `` People were even hoarding bags , '' he says . </s>
<s> Now producers hope prices have hit bottom . </s>
<s> They recently announced increases of a few cents a pound to take effect in the next several weeks . </s>
<s> No one knows , however , whether the new posted prices will stick once producers and customers start to haggle . </s>
<s> One doubter is George Krug , a chemical-industry analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. and a bear on plastics stocks . </s>
<s> Noting others ' estimates of when price increases can be sustained , he remarks , `` Some say October . </s>
<s> Some say November . </s>
<s> I say 1992 . '' </s>
<s> He argues that efforts to firm up prices will be undermined by producers ' plans to expand production capacity . </s>
<s> A quick turnaround is crucial to Quantum because its cash requirements remain heavy . </s>
<s> The company is trying to carry out a three-year , $ 1.3 billion plant-expansion program started this year . </s>
<s> At the same time , its annual payments on long-term debt will more than double from a year ago to about $ 240 million , largely because of debt taken on to pay a $ 50-a-share special dividend earlier this year . </s>
<s> Quantum described the payout at the time as a way for it to share the bonanza with its holders , because its stock price was n't reflecting the huge profit increases . </s>
<s> Some analysts saw the payment as an effort also to dispel takeover speculation . </s>
<s> Whether a cash crunch might eventually force the company to cut its quarterly dividend , raised 36 % to 75 cents a share only a year ago , has become a topic of intense speculation on Wall Street since Mr. Stookey deflected dividend questions in a Sept. 29 meeting with analysts . </s>
<s> Some viewed his response -- that company directors review the dividend regularly -- as nothing more than the standard line from executives . </s>
<s> But others came away thinking he had given something less than his usual straight-from-the-shoulder performance . </s>
<s> In any case , on the day of the meeting , Quantum 's shares slid $ 2.625 to $ 36.625 in Big Board trading . </s>
<s> On top of everything else , Quantum confronts a disaster at its plant in Morris , Ill . </s>
<s> After an explosion idled the plant in June , the company progressed in September to within 12 hours of completing the drawn-out process of restarting it . </s>
<s> Then a second explosion occurred . </s>
<s> Two workers died and six remain in the hospital . </s>
<s> This human toll adds the most painful dimension yet to the sudden change in Quantum 's fortunes . </s>
<s> Until this year , the company had been steadily lowering its accident rate and picking up trade-group safety awards . </s>
<s> A prolonged production halt at the plant could introduce another imponderable into Quantum 's financial future . </s>
<s> When a plant has just been running flat out to meet demand , calculating lost profit and thus claims under business-interruption insurance is straightforward . </s>
<s> But the numbers become trickier -- and subject to dickering between insured and insurer -- when demand is shifting . </s>
<s> `` You say you could have sold X percent of this product and Y percent of that , '' recalls Theodore Semegran , an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton who went through this exercise during his former career as a chemical engineer . </s>
<s> `` And then you still have to negotiate . '' </s>
<s> Quantum hopes the Morris plant , where limited production got under way last week , will resume full operation by year 's end . </s>
<s> The plant usually accounts for 20 % to 25 % of Quantum 's polyethylene production and 50 % of its ethylene production . </s>
<s> Not everything looks grim for Quantum . </s>
<s> The plant expansion should strengthen the company 's sway in the polyethylene business , where market share is often taken through sheer capacity . </s>
<s> By lifting ethylene production , the expansion will also lower the company 's raw material costs . </s>
<s> Quantum is also tightening its grip on its one large business outside chemicals , propane marketing . </s>
<s> Through a venture with its investment banker , First Boston Corp. , Quantum completed in August an acquisition of Petrolane Inc. in a transaction valued at $ 1.18 billion . </s>
<s> Petrolane is the second-largest propane distributor in the U.S. . </s>
<s> The largest , Suburban Propane , was already owned by Quantum . </s>
<s> Still , Quantum has a crisis to get past right now . </s>
<s> Some analysts speculate the weakening stock may yet attract a suitor . </s>
<s> The name surfacing in rumors is British Petroleum Co. , which is looking to expand its polyethylene business in the U.S. . </s>
<s> Asked about a bid for Quantum , a BP spokesman says , `` We pretty much have a policy of not commenting on rumors , and I think that falls in that category . </s>
