<s> Avis Inc. , following rival Hertz Corp. 's lead , said it is backing out of frequent-flier programs with three airlines . </s>
<s> The Garden City , N.Y. , car-rental company said it wo n't renew contracts with NWA Inc. 's Northwest Airlines unit , Pan Am Corp. 's Pan American World Airways unit and Midway Airlines at the end of this year . </s>
<s> But it remains involved in programs with AMR Corp. 's American Airlines unit and Delta Air Lines . </s>
<s> Industry estimates put Avis 's annual cost of all five programs at between $ 8 million and $ 14 million . </s>
<s> A spokesman for Avis would n't specify the costs but said the three airlines being dropped account for `` far less than half '' of the total . </s>
<s> Budget Rent a Car Corp. , of Chicago , and National Car Rental Systems Inc. , of Minneapolis , both said they had no plans to follow suit . </s>
<s> In fact , Budget indicated it saw some benefit to staying involved in these programs , in which renters earn frequent-flier miles and fliers can get car-rental discounts . </s>
<s> `` I can not see how this news by Hertz and Avis can not benefit Budget 's programs , '' said Bob Wilson , Budget 's vice president , marketing planning . </s>
<s> Northwest and Midway are two of the five airlines with which Budget has agreements . </s>
<s> National also participates in the Northwest frequent-flier program along with four other airlines , including Delta and USAir Group Inc. 's USAir unit . </s>
<s> A month ago , Hertz , of Park Ridge , N.J. , said that it would drop its marketing agreements at year end with Delta , America West and Texas Air Corp. 's Continental Airlines and Eastern Airlines , and that pacts with American Airlines , UAL Inc 's United Airlines and USAir also would be ended ... sometime after Dec. 31 . </s>
<s> At the time , Hertz said its annual fees to those airlines amounted to $ 20 million and that the value of redeemed awards topped $ 15 million . </s>
<s> Analysts and competitors , however , doubt the numbers were that high . </s>
<s> Budget said its frequent-flier costs are `` substantially below '' Avis 's level . </s>
<s> Robert D. Cardillo , Avis vice president of marketing , said , `` The proliferation and costs attached to -LCB- frequent-flier programs -RCB- have significantly diminished their value . '' </s>
<s> This year has been difficult for both Hertz and Avis , said Charles Finnie , car-rental industry analyst at Alex . Brown & Sons . </s>
<s> `` They 've been looking to get their costs down , and this is a fairly sensible way to do it , '' he said . </s>
