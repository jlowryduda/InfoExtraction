<s> CBS Inc. is cutting `` The Pat Sajak Show '' down to one hour from its current 90 minutes . </s>
<s> CBS insisted the move was n't a setback for the program , which is the network 's first entry into the late-night talk show format since 1972 . </s>
<s> `` I have every intention of making this the best possible show and having it run one hour is the best way to it , '' said Rod Perth , who was named vice president of late night entertainment in August . </s>
<s> `` This will raise the energy level of the show . '' </s>
<s> CBS will continue to program action-adventure shows to follow the Sajak hour . </s>
<s> But CBS News will extend its four-hour `` Nightwatch '' by 30 minutes and begin at 1:30 a.m . </s>
<s> The show , despite a promising start , has slipped badly in the weekly ratings as compiled by A.C. Nielsen Co. , finishing far below `` Tonight '' on NBC , a unit of General Electric Co. , and `` Nightline '' on ABC-TV , a unit of Capital Cities\/ABC Inc . </s>
<s> Further fractioning the late-night audience is the addition of the `` Arsenio Hall Show , '' syndicated by Paramount Communications Inc . </s>
