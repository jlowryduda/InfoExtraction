<s> The crowded field for notebook-sized computers is about to become a lot more crowded . </s>
<s> Compaq Computer Corp. 's long-awaited entry today into the notebook field is expected to put immediate heat on others in the market , especially Zenith Electronics Corp. , the current market leader , and on a swarm of promising start-ups . </s>
<s> Compaq 's series of notebooks extends a trend toward downsizing in the personal computer market . </s>
<s> One manufacturer already has produced a clipboard-sized computer called a notepad , and two others have introduced even smaller `` palmtops . '' </s>
<s> But those machines are still considered novelties , with keyboards only a munchkin could love and screens to match . </s>
<s> Compaq 's notebooks , by contrast , may be the first in their weight class not to skimp on features found in much bigger machines . </s>
<s> Analysts say they 're faster and carry more memory than anything else of their size on the market -- and they 're priced aggressively at $ 2,400 to $ 5,000 . </s>
<s> All of this comes in a machine that weighs only six pounds and fits comfortably into most briefcases . </s>
<s> In recent months , Compaq 's competition , including Zenith , Toshiba Corp. , Tandy Corp. and NEC Corp. all have introduced portables that weigh approximately the same and that are called notebooks -- perhaps misleadingly . </s>
<s> One analyst , noting that most such machines are about two inches thick , takes exception to the name . </s>
<s> `` This is n't quite a notebook -- I call it a phonebook , '' he says . </s>
<s> That ca n't be said of the $ 2,400 notepad computer introduced a few weeks ago by GRiD Systems Corp. , a unit of Tandy . </s>
<s> Instead of a keyboard , it features a writing surface , an electronic pen and the ability to `` read '' block printing . </s>
<s> At 4 1\/2 pounds , it may be too ambitiously named , but it nevertheless opens up the kind of marketing possibilities that make analysts froth . </s>
<s> Palmtops are n't far behind . </s>
<s> Atari Corp. 's Portfolio , introduced in Europe two months ago and in the U.S. in early September , weighs less than a pound , costs a mere $ 400 and runs on three AA batteries , yet has the power to run some spreadsheets and word processing programs . </s>
<s> Some critics , however , say its ability to run commonplace programs is restricted by a limited memory . </s>
<s> Poquet Computer Corp. , meanwhile , has introduced a much more sophisticated palmtop that can run Lotus 1-2-3 and other sophisticated software programs , but costs five times as much . </s>
<s> At stake is what Mike Swavely , Compaq 's president of North America operations , calls `` the Holy Grail of the computer industry '' -- the search for `` a real computer in a package so small you can take it everywhere . '' </s>
<s> The market is so new , nobody knows yet how big it can be . </s>
<s> `` I 've had a lot of people trying to sell me services to find out how big it is , '' says Tom Humphries , director of marketing for GRiD . </s>
<s> `` Whether it 's $ 5 billion or $ 3.5 billion , it does n't matter . </s>
<s> It 's huge . '' </s>
<s> Consider the growth of portables , which now comprise 12 % of all personal computer sales . </s>
<s> Laptops -- generally anything under 15 pounds -- have become the fastest-growing personal computer segment , with sales doubling this year . </s>
<s> Responding to that demand , however , has led to a variety of compromises . </s>
<s> Making computers smaller often means sacrificing memory . </s>
<s> It also has precluded use of the faster , more powerful microprocessors found in increasing numbers of desktop machines . </s>
<s> Size and weight considerations also have limited screen displays . </s>
<s> The competitive sniping can get pretty petty at times . </s>
<s> A Poquet spokesman , for example , criticizes the Atari Portfolio because it requires three batteries while the Poquet needs only two . </s>
<s> Both palmtops are dismissed by notebook makers , who argue that they 're too small -- a problem Poquet also encountered in focus groups , admits Gerry Purdy , director of marketing . </s>
<s> Poquet , trying to avoid the `` gadget '' label , responded with the tag line , `` The Poquet PC -- a Very Big Computer . '' </s>
<s> Despite the sniping , few question the inevitability of the move to small machines that do n't make compromises . </s>
<s> Toward that end , experts say the real battle will take place between center-stage players like Toshiba , Zenith and now Compaq . </s>
<s> Compaq 's new machines are considered a direct threat to start-up firms like Dynabook Inc. , which introduced in June a computer that , like Compaq 's , uses an Intel 286 microprocessor and has a hard disk drive . </s>
<s> But the Dynabook product is twice as heavy and costs more than Compaq 's . </s>
<s> Compaq 's announcement also spells trouble for Zenith , which last year had 28 % of the U.S. laptop market but recently agreed to sell its computer business to Cie. des Machines Bull , the French government-owned computer maker . </s>
<s> Zenith holders will vote in December on the proposed $ 635 million sale , a price that could slip because it is pegged to Zenith 's share and sales . </s>
<s> Compaq is already taking aim at Zenith 's market share . </s>
<s> Rod Canion , Compaq 's president and chief executive officer , notes pointedly that Zenith 's $ 2,000 MinisPort uses an `` unconventional '' two-inch floppy disk , whereas Compaq 's new machines use the more common 3 1\/2-inch disk . </s>
<s> John P. Frank , president of Zenith Data Systems , simply shrugs off such criticism , noting that 3 1\/2-inch floppies were also `` unconventional '' when they first replaced five-inch disks . </s>
<s> `` We do n't look at it as not being a standard , we look at it as a new standard , '' he argues . </s>
<s> Analysts do n't see it that way . </s>
<s> `` I ca n't imagine that you 'll talk to anyone who wo n't tell you this is dynamite for Compaq and a stopper for everyone else , '' says Gene Talsky , president of Professional Marketing Management Inc . </s>
<s> Adds Bill Lempesis , senior industry analyst for DataQuest , a high-technology market research firm : `` We basically think that these are very hot products . </s>
<s> The problem Compaq is going to have is that they wo n't be able to make enough of them . '' </s>
<s> Compaq 's machines include the 3 1\/2-inch floppy disk drive , a backlit screen that is only 1\/4-inch thick and an internal expansion slot for a modem -- in other words , almost all the capabilities of a typical office machine . </s>
<s> Others undoubtedly will follow , but most analysts believe Compaq has at least a six-month lead on the competition . </s>
<s> Toshiba 's line of portables , for example , features the T-1000 , which is in the same weight class but is much slower and has less memory , and the T-1600 , which also uses a 286 microprocessor , but which weighs almost twice as much and is three times the size . </s>
<s> A third model , marketed in Japan , may hit the U.S. by the end of the first quarter of 1990 , but by then , analysts say , Compaq will have established itself as one of three major players . </s>
<s> What about Big Blue ? </s>
<s> International Business Machines Corp. , analysts say , has been burned twice in trying to enter the laptop market and shows no signs of trying to get into notebooks anytime soon . </s>
