<s> Salomon Brothers International Ltd. , a British subsidiary of Salomon Inc. , announced it will issue warrants on shares of Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd . </s>
<s> The move closely follows a similar offer by Salomon of warrants for shares of Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp . </s>
<s> Under the latest offer , HK$ 62.5 million -LRB- US$ 8 million -RRB- of three-year warrants will be issued in London , each giving buyers the right to buy one Hong Kong Telecommunications share at a price to be determined Friday . </s>
<s> The 50 million warrants will be priced at HK$ 1.25 each and are expected to carry a premium to the share price of about 26 % . </s>
<s> In trading on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong , the shares closed Wednesday at HK$ 4.80 each . </s>
<s> At this price , the shares would have to rise above HK$ 6.05 for subscribers to Salomon 's issue to profitably convert their warrants . </s>
<s> While Hong Kong companies have in the past issued warrants on their own shares , Salomon 's warrants are the first here to be issued by a third party . </s>
<s> Salomon will `` cover '' the warrants by buying sufficient shares , or options to purchase shares , to cover its entire position . </s>
<s> Bankers said warrants for Hong Kong stocks are attractive because they give foreign investors , wary of volatility in the colony 's stock market , an opportunity to buy shares without taking too great a risk . </s>
<s> The Hong Kong Telecommunications warrants should be attractive to buyers in Europe , the bankers added , because the group is one of a handful of blue-chip stocks on the Hong Kong market that has international appeal . </s>
