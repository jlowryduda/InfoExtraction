<s> With economic tension between the U.S. and Japan worsening , many Japanese had feared last week 's visit from U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills . </s>
<s> They expected a new barrage of demands that Japan do something quickly to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S. . </s>
<s> Instead , they got a discussion of the need for the U.S. and Japan to work together and of the importance of the long-term view . </s>
<s> Mrs. Hills ' first trip to Japan as America 's chief trade negotiator had a completely different tone from last month 's visit by Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher . </s>
<s> Mr. Mosbacher called for concrete results by next spring in negotiations over fundamental Japanese business practices that supposedly inhibit free trade . </s>
<s> He said such results should be `` measurable in dollars and cents '' in reducing the U.S. trade deficit with Japan . </s>
<s> But Mrs. Hills , speaking at a breakfast meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan on Saturday , stressed that the objective `` is not to get definitive action by spring or summer , it is rather to have a blueprint for action . '' </s>
<s> She added that she expected `` perhaps to have a down payment ... some small step to convince the American people and the Japanese people that we 're moving in earnest . '' </s>
<s> How such remarks translate into policy wo n't become clear for months . </s>
<s> American and Japanese officials offered several theories for the difference in approach betwen Mr. Mosbacher and Mrs. Hills . </s>
<s> Many called it simply a contrast in styles . </s>
<s> But some saw it as a classic negotiating tactic . </s>
<s> Others said the Bush administration may feel the rhetoric on both sides is getting out of hand . </s>
<s> And some said it reflected the growing debate in Washington over pursuing free trade with Japan versus some kind of managed trade . </s>
<s> Asked to compare her visit to Mr. Mosbacher 's , Mrs. Hills replied : `` I did n't hear every word he spoke , but as a general proposition , I think we have a very consistent trade strategy in the Bush administration . '' </s>
<s> Yet more than one American official who sat in with her during three days of talks with Japanese officials said her tone often was surprisingly `` conciliatory . '' </s>
<s> `` I think my line has been very consistent , '' Mrs. Hills said at a news conference Saturday afternoon . </s>
<s> `` I am painted sometimes as ferocious , perhaps because I have a ferocious list of statutes to implement . </s>
<s> I do n't feel very ferocious . </s>
<s> I do n't feel either hard or soft . </s>
<s> I feel committed to the program of opening markets and expanding trade . '' </s>
<s> When she met the local press for the first time on Friday , Mrs. Hills firmly reiterated the need for progress in removing barriers to trade in forest products , satellites and supercomputers , three areas targeted under the Super 301 provision of the 1988 trade bill . </s>
<s> She highlighted exclusionary business practices that the U.S. government has identified . </s>
<s> But her main thrust was to promote the importance of world-wide free trade and open competition . </s>
<s> She said the trade imbalance was mainly due to macroeconomic factors and should n't be tackled by setting quantitative targets . </s>
<s> At her news conference for Japanese reporters , one economics journalist summed up the Japanese sense of relief . </s>
<s> `` My impression was that you would be a scary old lady , '' he said , drawing a few nervous chuckles from his colleagues . </s>
<s> `` But I am relieved to see that you are beautiful and gentle and intelligent and a person of integrity . '' </s>
<s> Mrs. Hills ' remarks did raise questions , at least among some U.S. officials , about what exactly her stance is on U.S. access to the Japanese semiconductor market . </s>
<s> The U.S. share of the Japanese market has been stuck around 10 % for years . </s>
<s> Many Americans have interpreted a 1986 agreement as assuring U.S. companies a 20 % share by 1991 , but the Japanese have denied making any such promise . </s>
<s> At one of her news conferences , Mrs. Hills said , `` I believe we can do much better than 20 % . '' </s>
<s> But she stressed , `` I am against managed trade . </s>
<s> I will not enter into an agreement that stipulates to a percentage of the market . </s>
