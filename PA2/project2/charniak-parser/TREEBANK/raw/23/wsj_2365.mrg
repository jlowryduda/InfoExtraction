<s> Predicting the financial results of computer firms has been a tough job lately . </s>
<s> Take Microsoft Corp. , the largest maker of personal computer software and generally considered an industry bellwether . </s>
<s> In July , the company stunned Wall Street with the prediction that growth in the personal computer business overall would be only 10 % in 1990 , a modest increase when compared with the sizzling expansion of years past . </s>
<s> Investors -- taking this as a sign that a broad industry slump was in the offing -- reacted by selling the company 's stock , which lost $ 3.25 that day to close at $ 52 in national over-the-counter trading . </s>
<s> But that was all of three months ago . </s>
<s> Last week , Microsoft said it expects revenue for its first quarter ended Sept. 30 to increase 34 % . </s>
<s> The announcement caused the company 's stock to surge $ 6.50 to close at $ 75.50 a share . </s>
<s> Microsoft 's surprising strength is one example of the difficulty facing investors looking for reassurances about the financial health of the computer firms . </s>
<s> `` It 's hard to know what to expect at this point , '' said Peter Rogers , an analyst at Robertson Stephens & Co . </s>
<s> `` The industry defies characterization . '' </s>
<s> To illustrate , Mr. Rogers said that of the 14 computer-related firms he follows , half will report for their most recent quarter earnings below last year 's results , and half above those results . </s>
<s> Among those companies expected to have a down quarter are Hewlett-Packard Co. , Amdahl Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. , generally solid performers in the past . </s>
<s> International Business Machines Corp. also is expected to report disappointing results . </s>
<s> Apple Computer Inc. , meanwhile , is expected to show improved earnings for the period ended Sept . </s>
<s> Another contradictory message comes from Businessland Inc. , a computer retailer . </s>
<s> In July , the company reported that booming sales of new personal computers from Apple and IBM had resulted in net income more than doubling for its fourth quarter ended June 30 to $ 7.4 million , or 23 cents a share . </s>
<s> This month , however , Businessland warned investors that results for its first quarter ended Sept. 30 had n't met expectations . </s>
<s> The company said it expects earnings of 14 to 17 cents a share , down from 25 cents a share in the year-earlier period . </s>
<s> While the earnings picture confuses , observers say the major forces expected to shape the industry in the coming year are clearer . </s>
<s> Companies will continue to war over standards . </s>
<s> In computer publishing , a battle over typefaces is hurting Adobe Systems Inc. , which sells software that controls the image produced by printers and displays . </s>
<s> Until recently , Adobe had a lock on the market for image software , but last month Apple , Adobe 's biggest customer , and Microsoft rebelled . </s>
<s> Now the two firms are collaborating on an alternative to Adobe 's approach , and analysts say they are likely to carry IBM , the biggest seller of personal computers , along with them . </s>
<s> The short-term outlook for Adobe 's business , however , appears strong . </s>
<s> The company is beginning to ship a new software program that 's being heralded as a boon for owners of low-end printers sold by Apple . </s>
<s> The program is aimed at improving the quality of printed material . </s>
<s> John Warnock , Adobe 's chief executive officer , said the Mountain View , Calif. , company has been receiving 1,000 calls a day about the product since it was demonstrated at a computer publishing conference several weeks ago . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , competition between various operating systems , which control the basic functions of a computer , spells trouble for software firms generally . </s>
<s> `` It creates uncertainty and usually slows down sales , '' said Russ Crabs , an analyst at Soundview Financial Group . </s>
<s> Mr. Crabs said this probably is behind the expected weak performance of Aldus Corp. , maker of a widely used computer publishing program . </s>
<s> He expects Aldus to report earnings of 21 cents a share on revenues of $ 19.5 million for its third quarter , compared with earnings of 30 cents a share on revenue of 20.4 million in the year-earlier period . </s>
<s> Aldus officials could n't be reached for comment . </s>
<s> On the other hand , the battle of the bus is expected to grow increasingly irrelevant . </s>
<s> A bus is the data highway within a computer . </s>
<s> IBM is backing one type of bus called microchannel , while the nine other leading computer makers , including H-P and Compaq Computer Corp. , have chosen another method . </s>
<s> `` Users do n't care about the bus , '' said Daniel Benton , an analyst at Goldman , Sachs & Co . </s>
<s> He said Apple 's family of Macintosh computers , for instance , uses four different buses `` and no one seems to mind . '' </s>
<s> The gap between winners and laggards will grow . </s>
<s> In personal computers , Apple , Compaq and IBM are expected to tighten their hold on their business . </s>
<s> At the same time , second-tier firms will continue to lose ground . </s>
<s> Some lagging competitors even may leave the personal computer business altogether . </s>
<s> Wyse Technology , for instance , is considered a candidate to sell its troubled operation . </s>
<s> `` Wyse has done well establishing a distribution business , but they have n't delivered products that sell , '' said Kimball Brown , an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities . </s>
<s> Mr. Brown estimates Wyse , whose terminals business is strong , will report a loss of 12 cents a share for its quarter ended Sept . </s>
<s> Personal-computer makers will continue to eat away at the business of more traditional computer firms . </s>
<s> Ever-more powerful desk-top computers , designed with one or more microprocessors as their `` brains , '' are expected to increasingly take on functions carried out by more expensive minicomputers and mainframes . </s>
<s> `` The guys that make traditional hardware are really being obsoleted by microprocessor-based machines , '' said Mr. Benton . </s>
<s> As a result of this trend , longtime powerhouses H-P , IBM and Digital Equipment Corp. are scrambling to counterattack with microprocessor-based systems of their own . </s>
<s> But they will have to act quickly . </s>
<s> Mr. Benton expects Compaq to unveil a family of high-end personal computers later this year that are powerful enough to serve as the hub for communications within large networks of desk-top machines . </s>
<s> A raft of new computer companies also has targeted this `` server '' market . </s>
