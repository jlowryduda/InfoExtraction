<s> Manville Corp. said it offered to buy $ 500 million of its convertible preferred stock from the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust in a move that would improve the trust 's liquidity and reduce the potential number of Manville shares outstanding . </s>
<s> Manville said it made the offer within the past several weeks as part of an effort to improve shareholder value . </s>
<s> It said it would purchase the stock at market price . </s>
<s> Manville and a spokeswoman for the trust said that the two are discussing the proposal but a decision has n't been made . </s>
<s> `` We are considering that offer along with all other alternatives , '' the trust spokeswoman said . </s>
<s> `` We need to look at how to maximize our cash flow to pay our beneficiaries . '' </s>
<s> The trust , created as part of Manville 's bankruptcy-law reorganization to compensate victims of asbestos-related diseases , owns 7.2 million of the Series A convertible preferred shares , which are each convertible into 10 Manville common shares . </s>
<s> The trust also owns half of Manville 's 48 million common shares outstanding . </s>
<s> Based on Manville 's closing price yesterday of $ 9.25 a share , Manville 's offer would purchase about 5.4 million of its preferred shares , or about 75 % of the trust 's preferred stock holding . </s>
<s> In addition to the stock and 20 % of Manville 's profits beginning in 1992 , the trust is supposed to receive $ 2.5 billion over its 27-year life . </s>
<s> But it initially was funded with about $ 765 million and may soon face a cash crunch . </s>
<s> As of June 30 , it had settled about 15,000 of 81,000 claims filed and its unpaid claims totaled $ 136 million , a large portion of its $ 268 million in cash and marketable securities . </s>
<s> Since most of its assets are tied to Manville , a forest and building products concern , the trust might also want to diversify its holdings . </s>
<s> As part of its offer , Manville said it requested changes in some covenants between it and the trust to allow Manville to `` reflect a more typical corporate ownership and financial structure . '' </s>
<s> A Manville spokesman would n't elaborate on the proposed changes . </s>
<s> But he said they are `` to a large degree , housekeeping , '' although some may generate some disagreement . </s>
<s> Manville said the shares issued to the trust were intended to be sold , as needed , and that Manville has the right of first refusal to buy those shares . </s>
