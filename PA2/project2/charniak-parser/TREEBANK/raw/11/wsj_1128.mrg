<s> Soichiro Honda 's picture now hangs with Henry Ford 's in the U.S. Automotive Hall of Fame , and the game-show `` Jeopardy '' is soon to be Sony-owned . </s>
<s> But no matter how much Japan gets under our skin , we 'll still have mom and apple pie . </s>
<s> On second thought , make that just mom . </s>
<s> A Japanese apple called the Fuji is cropping up in orchards the way Hondas did on U.S. roads . </s>
<s> By 1995 it will be planted more often than any other apple tree , according to a recent survey of six apple-industry sages by Washington State University horticulturist Robert Norton . </s>
<s> Some fruit visionaries say the Fuji could someday tumble the Red Delicious from the top of America 's apple heap . </s>
<s> It certainly wo n't get there on looks . </s>
<s> Compared to the Red Delicious , the exemplar of apple pulchritude , the Fuji is decidedly more dowdy -- generally smaller , less-perfectly shaped , greenish , with tinges of red . </s>
<s> To hear most U.S. growers tell it , we 'd still be in Paradise if the serpent had proffered one to Eve . </s>
<s> But how sweet it is . </s>
<s> It has more sugar `` than any apple we 've ever tested , '' says Duane Greene , a University of Massachusetts pomologist , or apple scholar . </s>
<s> It has a long shelf life and `` does n't fool the public , '' says Grady Auvil , an Orondo , Wash. , grower who is planting Fujis and spreading the good word about them . </s>
<s> `` It does n't look nice on the outside while getting mealy inside . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Auvil , razor sharp at 83 , has picked and packed a zillion pecks of apples over the past 65 years . </s>
<s> He is known as the father of the U.S.-grown Granny Smith , a radically different apple that the conventional wisdom once said would never catch on . </s>
<s> It did , shaking the apple establishment to its roots . </s>
<s> Now , even more radical changes seem afoot as the grand old maverick of American apples plays the role of Hiroshi Appleseed . </s>
<s> `` The Fuji is going to be No. 1 to replace the Red Delicious , '' he says . </s>
<s> The Delicious hegemony wo n't end anytime soon . </s>
<s> New apple trees grow slowly , and the Red Delicious is almost as entrenched as mom . </s>
<s> Its roots are patriotic -- with the first trees appearing in 1872 in an orchard near Peru , Iowa , to be exact . </s>
<s> For more than 50 years , it has been the apple of our eye . </s>
<s> A good Delicious can indeed be delicious . </s>
<s> More than twice as many Red Delicious apples are grown as the Golden variety , America 's No. 2 apple . </s>
<s> But the apple industry is ripe for change . </s>
<s> `` Red Delicious has been overplanted , and its prices have dropped below the cost of production , '' says Washington State 's Mr. Norton . </s>
<s> The scare over Alar , a growth regulator that makes apples redder and crunchier but may be carcinogenic , made consumers shy away from the Delicious , though they were less affected than the McIntosh . </s>
<s> The glut and consequent lower prices , combined with cancer fears , was a very serious blow to growers . </s>
<s> `` A lot of growers wo n't be around in a few years , '' says Mr. Norton , although they have stopped using Alar . </s>
<s> One may be William Broderick , a Sterling , Mass. , grower . </s>
<s> `` This is beautiful stuff , '' he says , looking ruefully at big boxes of just-picked Red Delicious next to his barn . </s>
<s> `` But I 'm going to lose $ 50,000 to $ 60,000 on it . </s>
<s> I 'm going to have to get another job this year just to eat . '' </s>
<s> Besides rotten prices , he has been hit recently by hail , a bark-nibbling horde of mice , fungi and bugs . </s>
<s> Some 500 insects and 150 diseases wiggle , chew and romp through growers ' nightmares , including maggots , mites , mildew , thrips , black rot and the flat-headed borer . </s>
<s> Even if a grower beats them back , his $ 2,000 rented bees might buzz off to the neighbors ' orchards instead of pollinating his , Mr. Broderick says . </s>
<s> Though growers ca n't always keep the worm from the apple , they can protect themselves against the price vagaries of any one variety by diversifying -- into the recently imported Gala , a sweet New Zealand native ; the Esopus Spitzenburg , reportedly Thomas Jefferson 's favorite apple ; disease-resistant kinds like the Liberty . </s>
<s> `` I 've ripped out a lot of Delicious '' and grafted the trees with many different shoots , says Steve Wood , a West Lebanon , N.H. , grower , tramping through his 100-acre Poverty Lane Orchard on a crisp autumn day recently . </s>
<s> `` I 've got 70 kinds of apples . </s>
<s> Here 's a Waltana , '' he exclaims , picking one off a tree . </s>
<s> He bites it , scowls and throws it down . `` </s>
<s> It 's a real dog . '' </s>
<s> Supermarkets are getting into the variety act , too . </s>
<s> They still buy apples mainly for big , red good looks -- that 's why so many taste like woodchucks ' punching bags . </s>
<s> But freshness counts more than it once did , and stores are expanding shelf space for unconventional , but tastier , and often pricier , apples . </s>
<s> `` Rather than sell 39-cents-a-pound Delicious , maybe we can sell 79-cents-a-pound Fujis , '' says Chuck Tryon , perishables director for Super Valu Inc. , a Minneapolis supermarket chain and food distributor . </s>
<s> The Fuji is a product of meticulous Japanese pomological engineering , which fostered it 50 years ago at a government research orchard . </s>
<s> Japanese researchers have bred dozens of strains of Fujis to hone its color , taste and shelf life . </s>
<s> Now the best of them age as gracefully as Grannies , the industry 's gold standard for storability . </s>
<s> In the cornucopia of go-go apples , the Fuji 's track record stands out : During the past 15 years , it has gone from almost zilch to some 50 % of Japan 's market . </s>
<s> `` The Japanese apple market is very keyed to high quality , '' says David Lane , a scientist at a Canadian horticulture research center in Summerland , British Columbia , and so apples are more of a delicacy there than a big food commodity . </s>
<s> The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that this year Americans will eat about 40 % more fresh apples per capita than the Japanese . </s>
<s> The Fuji is still small potatoes in the U.S. , sold mainly in fruit boutiques . </s>
<s> But in California , says Craig Ito , a Fuji-apple grower , `` There 's a Fuji apple cult . </s>
<s> Once somebody eats one , they get hooked . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Auvil , the Washington grower , says that he could sell Fujis to Taiwan buyers at $ 40 a box if he had them . </s>
<s> -LRB- Taiwan already is a big importer of Fujis from other places , he adds . -RRB- </s>
<s> But his first crop wo n't be picked till next year . </s>
<s> `` I expect to see the demand exceed supply for Fujis for the next 10 to 15 years , '' he adds . </s>
<s> Washington Red Delicious , by the way , are wholesaling for less than $ 10 a box these days . </s>
<s> Mr. Auvil sees Fujis , in part , as striking a blow against the perversion of U.S. apples by supermarkets . </s>
<s> `` When the chain stores took over , there was no longer a connection between grower and consumer . </s>
<s> A guy is sitting up in an office deciding what you 're going to eat . '' </s>
<s> After all , until the 1950s even the Red Delicious was a firm , delectable morsel . </s>
<s> Then , as growers bred them more for looks , and to satisfy supermarket chains ' demands of long-term storage , the Red went into decline . </s>
<s> Now , those red applelike things stores sell in summer are fruitbowl lovely , but usually not good eating . </s>
<s> They do deserve respect , however -- they are almost a year old , probably equal to about 106 in human years . </s>
<s> The Fuji , to be sure , has blemishes too . </s>
<s> It ripens later than most apples , and growing it in U.S. areas with chilly autumns may be tricky . </s>
<s> Moreover , the frumpy Fuji must compete with an increasingly dolledup Delicious . </s>
<s> Mr. Broderick , the Massachusetts grower , says the `` big boss '' at a supermarket chain even rejected his Red Delicious recently because they were n't waxed and brushed for extra shine . </s>
<s> And he had n't used hormones , which many growers employ to elongate their Delicious apples for greater eye appeal . </s>
<s> Still , Mr. Auvil points out , Grannies became popular without big , red looks , so why not Fujis ? </s>
<s> He sees a shift in American values -- at least regarding apples -- toward more emphasis on substance and less on glitz . </s>
<s> `` Taste has finally come to the fore , '' he says . </s>
<s> Or , for that matter , the core . </s>
