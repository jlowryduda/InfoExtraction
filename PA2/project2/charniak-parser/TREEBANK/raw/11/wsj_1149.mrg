<s> The Justice Department is in the process of trying to gain control over a law that federal Judge David Sentelle recently called a `` monster . '' </s>
<s> Needless to say , he was talking about RICO . </s>
<s> With its recently revised guidelines for RICO , Justice makes it clear that the law currently holds too many incentives for abuse by prosecutors . </s>
<s> The text of the `` new policy '' guidelines from the Criminal Division are reprinted nearby . </s>
<s> They strongly suggest that Justice 's prosecutions of Drexel Burnham Lambert , Michael Milken and Princeton\/Newport violated notions of fundamental fairness . </s>
<s> Justice is attempting to avoid a replay of these tactics . </s>
<s> This amounts to an extraordinary repudiation of the tenure of New York mayoral candidate and former U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani , who was more inclined to gathering scalps than understanding markets . </s>
<s> The new guidelines limit the pretrial forfeitures of assets of RICOed defendants and their investors , clients , bankers and others . </s>
<s> This follows earlier new guidelines from the Tax Division prohibiting Princeton\/Newport-like tax cases from masquerading as RICO cases . </s>
<s> The forfeiture memo cited `` considerable criticism in the press , because of a perception that pre-trial freezing of assets is tantamount to a seizure of property without due process . '' </s>
<s> It told prosecutors not to seek forfeitures if there are `` less intrusive '' alternatives , such as bonds , and in any case not to seek forfeitures `` disproportionate to the defendant 's crime . '' </s>
<s> These changes come a tad late for Princeton\/Newport , the first RICOed securities firm . </s>
<s> It was forced into liquidation before trial when investors yanked their funds after the government demanded a huge pre-trial asset forfeiture . </s>
<s> Princeton\/Newport investors , including McKinsey & Co. and the Harvard endowment , made the rational decision to withdraw their money ; for the firm , the liquidation was sentence first , verdict later . </s>
<s> Prosecutors wanted $ 23.8 million in forfeiture for alleged tax fraud of some $ 400,000 . </s>
<s> The experience of Princeton\/Newport and initiation of other RICO-forfeiture cases against legitimate businesses taught Drexel that a RICOed investment bank would be an ex-investment bank . </s>
<s> Drexel therefore agreed instead to an arrangement allowing it to plea to charges `` which the company is not in a position to dispute '' because of RICO . </s>
<s> Part of Drexel 's plea was to cut Mr. Milken loose . </s>
<s> So after all the prosecutorial hoopla no one has established what , if anything , Drexel did wrong . </s>
<s> So two cheers for the new rules . </s>
<s> Justice has finally recognized its employees ' abuses , thanks largely to the demands for reform by former U.S. attorney in Washington Joseph diGenova , who wants to salvage RICO for real criminals . </s>
<s> But prosecutorial guidelines are effective only if someone at Justice is willing and able to supervise hyperactive prosecutors . </s>
<s> Judge Sentelle , of the appeals court in Washington , made this point at a Cato Institute conference last week in a remarkable speech titled , `` RICO : The Monster That Ate Jurisprudence . '' </s>
<s> He said ours is supposed to be `` a government of laws not of men , '' and yet RICO defenders `` tell us that we should rely on prosecutorial discretion to protect against overbreadth of RICO . '' </s>
<s> No prosecutorial guidelines , observed or unobserved , limit civil RICO cases by plaintiffs for damages . </s>
<s> What now for Princeton\/Newport officials , Drexel and Mr. Milken ? </s>
<s> Justice should review these cases to see what other prosecutorial abuses may have occurred . </s>
<s> We suspect that Justice will some day agree that only the complete repeal of RICO can guarantee an end to injustices in its name . </s>
