<s> Japan has climbed up from the ashes of World War II and a gross national product of about $ 800 per capita to reach the heavyweight class among industrialized nations . </s>
<s> Now this remarkable economic growth seems to be coming to an end because the government has not converted itself into a modern , democratic , `` developed nation '' mode of operation . </s>
<s> Until 1980 , when Japan joined the $ 10,000 per capita GNP club of the advanced countries , it was a model developing nation . </s>
<s> The government built ports , bridges , highways , schools , hospitals and railways . </s>
<s> When industries were weak , it protected them . </s>
<s> It gave the Japanese people a value system , based on the rationalization that given the country 's lack of natural resources , they must work hard to create value through exports and buy food with the surplus . </s>
<s> Individual prosperity inevitably would result . </s>
<s> That system has worked . </s>
<s> The standard of living has increased steadily over the past 40 years ; more than 90 % of the people consider themselves middle class . </s>
<s> The people have given their leading and only credible political party , the Liberal Democratic Party , clear and uninterrupted power for those 40 years . </s>
<s> The LDP won by a landslide in the last election , in July 1986 . </s>
<s> But less than two years later , the LDP started to crumble , and dissent rose to unprecedented heights . </s>
<s> The symptoms all point to one thing : Japan does not have a modern government . </s>
<s> Its government still wants to sit in the driver 's seat , set the speed , step on the gas , apply the brakes and steer , with 120 million people in the back seat . </s>
<s> In a modern system , the government 's role is to give the people as much choice as possible and to keep them well informed so they are capable of making a choice . </s>
<s> It also allows people to buy the best and the cheapest goods from anywhere in the world . </s>
<s> The Japanese government does n't allow this . </s>
<s> The Ministry of Agriculture and Fishery actually is a ministry for farmers and fishermen instead of a ministry of provisions . </s>
<s> The Ministry of Health and Welfare is a ministry of doctors and pharmaceutical companies rather than an organization dedicated to protecting the health of the people . </s>
<s> The Ministry of Education is nothing but a cartel for licensed teachers , and certainly does not act on behalf of students . </s>
<s> The Ministry of Construction spreads concrete throughout the country and boasts in international conferences that Japan 's paved roadway per capita is the longest in the world , but they seldom think of the poor commuters who spend so much time sitting in traffic . </s>
<s> The Ministry of Transportation serves the industry , certainly not the passengers who must pay extraordinarily high prices . </s>
<s> And the Ministry of Foreign Affairs works for itself , supporting Japanese diplomats who sprinkle abundant aid money around the world to ensure that their seat at the dinner table is next to the host 's . </s>
<s> This ministry has done nothing to correct the misunderstandings and misperceptions that are at the root of Japan 's deteriorating image . </s>
<s> Instead , it seems to be using foreign pressure and even the trade conflict to expand its sphere of influence vis a vis other ministries . </s>
<s> All this illustrates that Japanese ministries still have a `` provider '' mentality ; they do not serve the people , and particularly not consumers . </s>
<s> They serve the industries and the special-interest groups . </s>
<s> The rest of the world accepted such methods when Japan was developing . </s>
<s> Japanese put up with it because the government provided job stability and growing paychecks . </s>
<s> Japan is not a political country . </s>
<s> It is a bureaucratic country . </s>
<s> The Diet plays a minor role compared with the powerful bureaucratic system . </s>
<s> Most bills are drafted by bureaucrats , not politicians . </s>
<s> The Diet does n't normally even debate bills because the opposition parties are so often opposed to whatever LDP does that it would be a waste of time . </s>
<s> So most bills are passed without full discussion ; particularly difficult bills are passed in the absence of the opposition parties . </s>
<s> A recent example is the 3 % consumption tax on all commercial activities . </s>
<s> This makes enormous sense in Japan , where direct tax accounts for more than 70 % of revenues and the capture rate of direct tax is so unfair . </s>
<s> If you are a salaried man , Amen ! 100 % captured . </s>
<s> If you are a retailer , 50 % , and a farmer , 30 % . </s>
<s> To correct this inequality , most people would have favored an indirect tax , like the consumption tax . </s>
<s> But the bill was passed without debate in the Diet , in the absence of the opposition . </s>
<s> As a result , the Japanese people did n't know what to expect when the new law was introduced on April 1 . </s>
<s> They were frustrated by the longer queues at the cashier and the small coins given as change . </s>
<s> All of a sudden , prices were no longer in denominations of 100 or 200 . </s>
<s> They were 103 or 206 . </s>
<s> Pockets exploded with one-yen coins . </s>
<s> While people were jingling their change , the LDP politicians were caught in scandals . </s>
<s> Money , such as in Recruit 's political donations , and women , as in the cases of Prime Minister Sosuke Uno and Secretary General Tokuo Yamashita , seldom have caused political scandals in Japan . </s>
<s> Whereas most men were a bit ambivalent about the sex scandals -LRB- though they were furious about Recruit -RRB- , women were upset about both and surged to the polls . </s>
<s> In the recent Upper House and Tokyo metropolitan congressional elections , in which the Socialist Party won a runaway victory , 60 % of all women voted , as opposed to the usual 40 % . </s>
<s> It is difficult to analyze how much of their anger was due to Recruit , the sex scandals , or the one-yen coins in their purses , but they obviously were voting to punish the LDP . </s>
<s> Taken by surprise , the Socialist Party is busy changing its doctrines . </s>
<s> It 's now OK to deal with the U.S. , but not the Soviet Union . </s>
<s> Nuclear power plants are acceptable . </s>
<s> The U.S.-Japan Security Treaty can continue , sort of . </s>
<s> And so on . </s>
<s> Against the rapid cosmetic overhaul of the Socialist Party the LDP has been paralyzed . </s>
<s> Now is the time to reform the government from a provider , developing-country vanguard role to that of a modern , industrialized nation in which consumers have the ultimate choice . </s>
<s> If the LDP , as currently composed , ca n't make the transformation , then it should split into two parties . </s>
<s> One party could stand for consumer interests , small government , free trade and globalism to put Japan clearly among the most developed and open countries . </s>
<s> The other party could continue on the traditional track of the LDP , representing the manufacturers ' preference for larger government , control , regulation and protectionism . </s>
<s> The LDP must make a decision immediately ; Lower House elections must take place before June . </s>
<s> In the current mood of the Japanese people , journalists and even some industrialists , giving power to the Socialists might be good for the LDP , cleansing it of past sins . </s>
<s> We must not forget , however , that such a humble political experiment could cause a global tidal wave of shocks in real-estate and financial markets . </s>
<s> At the most there is only nine months before the LDP fuse burns out . </s>
