<s> Medieval philosophers used to hold the sensible belief that it was more perfect to exist than not to exist , and that to exist as a matter of necessity was most perfect of all . </s>
<s> Now , only God exists as a matter of absolute necessity ; it is built into His nature . </s>
<s> But since the time of Darwin , we humans could at least claim a sort of natural necessity for the existence of our species . </s>
<s> Are n't we , after all , the inevitable culmination of that stately pageant called evolution ? </s>
<s> If mutation and natural selection slowly but surely give rise to more and more advanced forms of life , then it was only a matter of eons before splendid beings endowed with reason , self-awareness and taste shimmered onto the scene . </s>
<s> Now along comes Stephen Jay Gould to dash this flattering illusion . </s>
<s> His credentials are excellent for the task . </s>
<s> Star lecturer at Harvard , author of numerous popular books on science , and scourge of the creationist lobby , Mr. Gould is perhaps the world 's most eminent evolutionary theorist . </s>
<s> Yet he puts quite a twist on the old story handed down from Darwin . </s>
<s> For him , natural history is anything but a gradual , predictable march from primordial slime to human consciousness ; it is a careening , chaotic affair in which the emergence of a featherless biped was a one-in-a-million shot . </s>
<s> In `` Wonderful Life : The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History '' -LRB- Norton , 326 pages , $ 19.95 -RRB- , Mr. Gould makes his case for `` the awesome improbability of human evolution . '' </s>
<s> The argument turns on the discovery in 1909 of an amazing fossil quarry high in the Canadian Rockies called the Burgess Shale . </s>
<s> Here , in an area smaller than a city block , lay buried traces of countless weird creatures that had frolicked more than 500 million years ago -- creatures whose anatomical variety far exceeded what can be found in all the world 's oceans today . </s>
<s> Such an embarrassment of riches was inconceivable to the man who discovered the Burgess Shale , one Charles Doolittle Walcott . </s>
<s> The received Darwinian wisdom of the day said that animals living so long ago must be simple in design , limited in scope and ancestral to contemporary species . </s>
<s> Accordingly , the hidebound traditionalist reconstructed hypothetical organisms from the Burgess fossils in such a way that they could be shoehorned into familiar categories . </s>
<s> It was not until the early 1970s that Cambridge Prof. Harry Whittington and two sharp graduate students began to publish a reinterpretation of the Burgess Shale . </s>
<s> By making clever inferences about how the squashed and distorted fossil remains corresponded to three-dimensional structures , this trio was able to piece together a series of wondrous beasties quite unlike anything currently on the planet . </s>
<s> One was so fantastic in appearance , it was dubbed Hallucigenia . </s>
<s> Would that Mr. Gould 's minute descriptions of these creatures was always so colorful . </s>
<s> A good deal of the book is boring , particularly the endless allusions to high and pop culture and the frequent jokes festooning the text . </s>
<s> These turns do not provide sufficient relief from sentences like , `` Most modern chelicerates have six uniramous appendages on the prosoma . '' </s>
<s> Interest picks up , though , when Mr. Gould gets around to discussing the meaning of the Burgess oddities for the theory of evolution . </s>
<s> Not long after the appearance of life , evidently , there was an explosive proliferation in the number of animal designs seen on the earth . </s>
<s> The vast majority of them , however , were wiped out by a succession of environmental upheavals that were too sudden and catastrophic for the normal rules of natural selection to operate . </s>
<s> Consequently , the winnowing process was like a lottery `` in which each group -LCB- held -RCB- a ticket unrelated to its anatomical virtues . </s>
<s> '' So much for survival of the fittest . </s>
<s> So much , too , for the notion that we humans triumphed in the Darwinian struggle by evolving big brains . </s>
<s> Our mammalian forerunners lucked out through the extraterrestrial impact that did in the dinosaurs because they were small , not smart . </s>
<s> If anyone has difficulty imagining a world in which history went merrily on without us , Mr. Gould sketches several . </s>
<s> In one , birds are the dominant carnivores ; in another the seas abound with `` little penises . '' </s>
<s> Back when the Burgess fauna were flourishing , it seems , human evolutionary hopes hung on the survival of a little worm with a backbone called Pikaia . </s>
<s> Mr. Gould finds this oddly exhilarating ; like an existentialist of old , he views our contingency as `` a source of both freedom and consequent moral responsibility . '' </s>
<s> I , by contrast , can not help feeling that if some other curiosity from the Burgess Shale had survived instead , beings at once wiser and less boorish than Homo sapiens might have eventually gained earthly dominion . </s>
<s> But even if no conscious life had evolved here at all , the universe is a big place , and given the right conditions , sympathetic to creating some form of life . </s>
<s> Surely at some other cosmic address a Gouldoid creature would have risen out of the ooze to explain why , paleontologically speaking , `` it is , indeed , a wonderful life . '' </s>
