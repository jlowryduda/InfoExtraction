<s> The Nasdaq over-the-counter market did n't fully recover from a selling stampede , and closed down 1.2 % . </s>
<s> The effects on the market of the mostly computer-driven sell-off among exchange-listed stocks irked many market makers , who watched the Nasdaq Composite Index tumble in sympathy with the Dow Jones Industrial Average , and then saw it get left behind in the subsequent rally . </s>
<s> After plummeting 1.8 % at one point during the day , the composite rebounded a little , but finished down 5.52 , at 461.70 . </s>
<s> In contrast , the industrial average recovered almost completely from its skid and closed down 0.1 % . </s>
<s> The New York Stock Exchange Composite was 0.4 % lower for the day . </s>
<s> As usual , the over-the-counter market 's biggest technology stocks were hardest hit . </s>
<s> Microsoft , battered by profit taking in recent sessions , sank as much as 4 ; but it finished at 80 7\/8 , down 2 1\/4 on volume of one million shares . </s>

<s> `` The market started with several strikes against it , '' said Peter DaPuzzo , head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton , referring to news that the labor-management buy-out of UAL Corp. continued to unravel , and reports that the junk-bond market is disintegrating . </s>
<s> But the computer-guided selling in response to those developments dealt a serious blow to the over-the-counter market , Mr. DaPuzzo said . </s>
<s> Even though the over-the-counter market usually does n't fall by as much as listed stocks during program-selling blitzes , he said , `` when the market does recover , the damage is done and it leaves Nasdaq down more than the Big Board . '' </s>
<s> Mr. DaPuzzo also complained that the sharp swings in stock prices lately is scaring away retail and foreign investors . </s>
<s> While Shearson does n't do computer-guided program trading for its own account , the firm does execute orders for clients involved in the buying and selling of shares tied to movements in certain stock indexes , Mr. DaPuzzo acknowledged . </s>
<s> The volatility inherent in program trading troubled other traders , too . </s>
<s> They do n't like the risks they are forced to assume when prices swing so drastically . </s>
<s> Market makers are supposed to keep supplies of stocks on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur . </s>
<s> That means that on days when prices are tumbling and sellers abound they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will . </s>
<s> In such an environment , a market maker can absorb huge losses . </s>
<s> But the recent volatility in stock prices caused by the program trading has made some market makers less willing to soak up the stocks that are for sale . </s>
<s> The market makers say they are n't comfortable carrying big positions in stocks because they realize prices can tumble quickly . </s>
<s> The situation makes it harder to buy and sell shares quickly , exacerbating the rise and fall in stock prices during program-dominated trading . </s>
<s> Groused Robert Antolini , head of over-the-counter trading at Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette : `` It 's making it tough for traders to make money . '' </s>
<s> He said that when sell programs kick in , many traders believe that `` there 's no sense in sticking your nose out because you 're an instant loser . '' </s>
