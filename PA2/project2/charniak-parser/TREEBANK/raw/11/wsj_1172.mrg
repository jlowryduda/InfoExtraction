<s> Britain 's current account deficit dropped to # 1.6 billion -LRB- $ 2.56 billion -RRB- in September from an adjusted # 2 billion -LRB- $ 3.21 billion -RRB- the previous month , but the improvement comes amid increasing concern that a recession could strike the U.K. economy next year . </s>
<s> The Confederation of British Industry 's latest survey shows that business executives expect a pronounced slowdown , largely because of a 16-month series of interest-rate increases that has raised banks ' base lending rates to 15 % . </s>
<s> `` The outlook has deteriorated since the summer , with orders and employment falling and output at a standstill , '' said David Wigglesworth , chairman of the industry group 's economic committee . </s>
<s> He also said investment by businesses is falling off . </s>
<s> Of 1,224 companies surveyed , 31 % expect to cut spending on plant equipment and machinery , while only 28 % plan to spend more . </s>
<s> But despite mounting recession fears , government data do n't yet show the economy grinding to a halt . </s>
<s> Unemployment , for example , has continued to decline , and the September trade figures showed increases in both imports and exports . </s>
<s> As a result , Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 's government is n't currently expected to ease interest rates before next spring , if then . </s>
<s> Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson views the high rates as his chief weapon against inflation , which was ignited by tax cuts and loose credit policies in 1986 and 1987 . </s>
<s> Officials fear that any loosening this year could rekindle inflation or further weaken the pound against other major currencies . </s>
<s> Fending off attacks on his economic policies in a House of Commons debate yesterday , Mr. Lawson said inflation `` remains the greatest threat to our economic well-being '' and promised to take `` whatever steps are needed '' to choke it off . </s>
<s> The latest government figures said retail prices in September were up 7.6 % from a year earlier . </s>
<s> Many economists have started predicting a mild recession next year . </s>
<s> David Owen , U.K. economist with Kleinwort Benson Group , reduced his growth forecast for 1990 to 0.7 % from 1.2 % and termed the risk of recession next year `` quite high . '' </s>
<s> But he said the downturn probably wo n't become a `` major contraction '' similar to those of 1974 and 1982 . </s>
<s> Still , Britain 's current slump is a cause for concern here as the nation joins in the European Community 's plan to create a unified market by 1992 . </s>
<s> Compared with the major economies on the Continent , the U.K. faces both higher inflation and lower growth in the next several months . </s>
<s> As a result , Mr. Owen warned , investment will be more likely to flow toward the other European economies and `` the U.K. will be less prepared for the single market . '' </s>
<s> Britain 's latest trade figures contained some positive news for the economy , such as a surge in the volume of exports , which were 8.5 % higher than a year earlier . </s>
<s> But while September exports rose to # 8.43 billion , imports shot up to # 10.37 billion . </s>
<s> The resulting # 1.9 billion merchandise trade deficit was partly offset by an assumed surplus of # 300 million in so-called invisible items , which include income from investments , services and official transfers . </s>
<s> Despite the narrowing of the monthly trade gap , economists expect the current account deficit for all of 1989 to swell to about # 20 billion from # 14.6 billion in 1988 . </s>
<s> Increasingly , economists say the big deficit reflects the slipping competitive position of British industry . </s>
<s> `` When the country gets wealthier , we tend to buy high-quality imports , '' Mr. Owen said . </s>
