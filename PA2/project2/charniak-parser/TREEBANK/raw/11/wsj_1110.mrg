<s> New orders for durable goods fell back slightly in September after shooting up the month before , reflecting weakening auto demand after a spurt of orders for new 1990 models , the Commerce Department reported . </s>
<s> Orders for military equipment , household appliances , machinery and other goods expected to last at least three years dipped 0.1 % last month , to $ 126.68 billion , after leaping 3.9 % in August , the department said . </s>
<s> Most analysts had expected a sharper decline after the steep rise in August . </s>
<s> Moreover , a recent government report showing widespread layoffs in manufacturing had contributed to perceptions that the manufacturing sector of the economy had slowed to a crawl . </s>
<s> But many economists pointed to a 1.8 % September rise in orders outside the volatile transportation category . </s>
<s> That `` suggests the manufacturing sector is not falling apart , '' said Sally Kleinman , an economist at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. in New York . </s>
<s> She added , however : `` It is not robust by any means . '' </s>
<s> While a decline in orders for cars and civilian airplanes pulled down the orders total , an enormous jump in orders for heavy military equipment propped it up . </s>
<s> Orders for capital defense goods skyrocketed 56 % , and a government analyst said nearly all areas saw increases , including airplanes , missiles , ships , tanks and communications equipment . </s>
<s> Orders for military goods usually catapult in September , government officials say , as the Pentagon scrambles to spend its money before the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1 . </s>
<s> While all the numbers in the durable goods report were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations , a Commerce Department analyst said that the adjustment probably did n't factor out all of the wide-ranging surge in defense orders . </s>
<s> Without the increase in defense bookings , September orders would have plummeted 3.9 % . </s>
<s> Analysts were most unsettled by evidence the backlog of orders at factories is slipping . </s>
<s> Unfilled orders for durable goods rose 0.4 % in September , to $ 476.14 billion , after declining for the first time in 2 1\/2 years in August . </s>
<s> In July unfilled orders grew 1 % . </s>
<s> But analysts noted that excluding transportation - where what they believe was a temporary surge in auto demand pushed up the figures - order backlogs have declined for three months in a row . </s>
<s> `` It means we 're eating into the bread that keeps us going . </s>
<s> That is a little disturbing , '' Ms. Kleinman said . </s>
<s> `` It also means if you have a real drop-off in orders , production will likely fall off very quickly because there is less to keep things going . '' </s>
<s> Capital goods orders outside of the defense sector tumbled for the second month in a row , posting a 5.6 % drop after a 10.3 % decline . </s>
<s> Such steep drops in a category seen as a barometer of business investment would customarily be grave news for the economy . </s>
<s> But a Commerce Department analyst said that in both months orders would have risen had it not been for a drop in civilian aircraft bookings , a category that is showing declines only after a huge surge earlier this year . </s>
<s> Still , Milton Hudson , senior economic adviser at Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. in New York , said : `` If you look back a half-year or so the evidence was pretty good of affirmative strength in the capital-goods sector . </s>
<s> Now at least there are question marks about that , and without any question the pace of growth has slowed . </s>
