<s> In Houston , we have seen how bad the housing problem can become . </s>
<s> Unused houses deteriorate rapidly , affecting the value of nearby homes ; in a domino effect , the entire neighborhood can fall victim . </s>
<s> At this stage some people just `` walk away '' from homes where the mortgage exceeds current market value . </s>
<s> But most of them could have afforded to keep up their payments -- they chose not to do so . </s>
<s> The problem is so vast that we need to try innovative solutions -- in small-scale experiments . </s>
<s> Here are some ideas : </s>
<s> 1 -RRB- Foreclosed homes could be sold by the FHA for no down payment -LRB- the biggest obstacle to young buyers -RRB- , but with personal liability for the mortgage -LRB- no walking away by choice -RRB- . </s>
<s> 2 -RRB- Encourage long-term occupancy by forgiving one month 's payment -LRB- off the tail end of the mortgage -RRB- for every six months paid ; or perhaps have the down payment deferred to the end of the mortgage -LRB- balloon -RRB- , but `` forgiven '' on a monthly pro-rata basis as long as the owner remains the occupant . </s>
<s> 3 -RRB- Develop rental agreements with exclusive purchase options for the renter . </s>
<s> An occupant will , in most every case , be better for the home and neighborhood than a vacant house . </s>
<s> In this way , the house is not dumped on to a glutted market . </s>

<s> The Federal Housing Administration , Veterans Administration and the Department of Housing and Urban Development further aggravate the problem of affordable housing stock by `` buying in '' to their foreclosed properties -LRB- of which there are , alas , many -RRB- at an inflated `` balance due '' -- say $ 80,000 on a house worth $ 55,000 -- instead of allowing a free market to price the house for what it 's really worth . </s>
<s> Worse , the properties then sit around deteriorating for maybe a year or so , but are resold eventually -LRB- because of the attractiveness of the low down payment , etc . -RRB- to a marginal buyer who ca n't afford both the mortgage and needed repairs ; and having little vested interest that buyer will walk away and the vicious cycle repeats itself all over again . </s>
