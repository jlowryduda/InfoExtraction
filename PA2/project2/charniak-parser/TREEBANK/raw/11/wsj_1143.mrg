<s> Probably the most clear-cut Soviet violation , for example , is the Krasnoyarsk radar . </s>
<s> -- `` Arms Control Reality , '' Nov. 20 , 1984 , the first of some 20 Journal editorials saying that Krasnoyarsk violated the ABM treaty . </s>
<s> -- `` Whether the installation is for early warning or space track , it clearly is not deployed , '' the lawmakers said . </s>
<s> `` Thus we judge it to be not a violation of the ABM treaty at this time . '' </s>
<s> The delegation included a reporter from the New York Times , aides to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and Rep. Les AuCoin , and Natural Resources Defense Council staff members . </s>
<s> -- The Washington Post , Sept. 9 , 1987 . </s>
<s> -- The U.S.S.R. has taken unprecedented unilateral measures of openness , by giving American representatives a possibility to inspect the building site of the Krasnoyarsk radar as well as radar vans in the areas of Gomel and Moscow , so as to see for themselves that there are no violations of the ABM treaty of 1972 on the part of the Soviet Union . </s>
<s> -- Letter from Eduard Shevardnadze to U.N. Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar , reported in Tass , June 10 , 1988 . </s>
<s> -- The construction of this station equal in size to the Egyptian pyramids constituted , I say it directly , a clear violation of ABM . </s>
<s> -- Eduard Shevardnadze , Oct. 23 , 1989 . </s>
<s> We 're happy , we guess , to receive confirmation of the Krasnoyarsk violation from the Soviets , five years after we started writing about it . </s>
<s> Perhaps even the American apologists will now accede . </s>
<s> Without question , something intriguing is going on in the policy chambers of the Politburo . </s>
<s> As it bids for new agreements , new loans and indeed admission to the civilized world , the Soviet government has recognized it has a credibility problem . </s>
<s> So after 70 years , it is confessing the obvious , hoping to be believed about other things . </s>
<s> It 's not enough . </s>
<s> If the Soviets want to be believed , they need to start telling the truth about more than the totally obvious . </s>
<s> Our own test of `` glasnost 's '' authenticity would be a Soviet decision to open itself to a complete international examination of one of the most troubling mysteries in U.S.-Soviet relations -- the reported 1979 anthrax outbreak at a Soviet military facility in Sverdlovsk . </s>
<s> The U.S. government has never waivered in its assessment of this incident as an accident at a biological weapons facility there , and hence a violation of the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention . </s>
<s> The Pentagon 's recently issued `` Soviet Military Power , '' though in general adopting a softer line , repeated the Sverdlovsk assessment . </s>
<s> It also was detailed in Congressional testimony this past February : An explosion at the Microbiology and Virology Institute in Sverdlovsk released anthrax germs that caused a significant number of deaths . </s>
<s> Since Mr. Shevardnadze did not address this topic before the Supreme Soviet , the Soviet Union 's official position remains that the anthrax deaths were caused by tainted meat . </s>
<s> We doubt this claim just as we doubted Mr. Shevardnadze 's assurance last year that Krasnoyarsk did n't violate the ABM treaty . </s>
<s> And just as we did not believe the tendentious claims of the Congressmen and arms-control advocates who visited Krasnoyarsk , we are in no way persuaded by the assent to the tainted-meat theory by a U.S. team of scientists who met with Soviet counterparts in Washington last year . </s>
<s> The Soviets ' explanation is that the anthrax came from one lot of animal feed made from the bones of cattle that grazed on soil that was naturally infected with anthrax spores . </s>
<s> Harvard 's Matthew Meselson -- who we read has sold something called the `` scientific community '' on the notion that `` yellow rain '' attacks on the Laotian Hmong were in fact the result of fecal showers by giant bees -- found the Soviet anthrax scenario `` completely plausible . '' </s>
<s> We do n't believe it . </s>
<s> And we certainly do not believe that Mr. Gorbachev or any of his emissaries yet deserve to have the West take their word for it . </s>
<s> Sverdlovsk is a large gray cloud over glasnost and indeed over the legitimacy of the arms-control process itself . </s>
<s> The U.S. government 's Sverdlovsk complaint , as with Krasnoyarsk , is no mere political posturing . </s>
<s> Biological weapons violations have figured little in political debate , and indeed have not been pressed vigorously enough by the U.S. government . </s>
<s> But the stated U.S. position is detailed and specific , and the prospect of biological warfare is profoundly chilling . </s>
<s> The Soviets should be willing to set in motion a process that would allow them to acknowledge that Sverdlovsk violated the 1972 agreement or , alternatively , that would give U.S. specialists reasonable confidence that this was a wholly civilian accident . </s>
<s> Until that happens , glasnost can not begin to deserve the kind of credibility Mr. Shevardnadze was bidding for with his confessions on Monday . </s>
