<s> People start their own businesses for many reasons . </s>
<s> But a chance to fill out sales-tax records is rarely one of them . </s>
<s> Red tape is the bugaboo of small business . </s>
<s> Ironically , the person who wants to run his or her own business is probably the active , results-oriented sort most likely to hate meeting the rules and record-keeping demands of federal , state and local regulators . </s>
<s> Yet every business owner has to face the mound of forms and regulations -- and often is the only one available to tackle it . </s>
<s> There is hope of change . </s>
<s> Last week , Sen. Malcolm Wallop -LRB- R. , Wyo . -RRB- held hearings on a bill to strengthen an existing law designed to reduce regulatory hassles for small businesses . </s>
<s> `` A great many federal regulations are meant for larger entities and do n't really apply to small businesses , '' says Marian Jacob , a legislative aide to Sen. Wallop . </s>
<s> Other lawmakers are busy trying to revive the recently lapsed Paperwork Reduction Act , which many feel benefited small enterprises . </s>
<s> Thus , optimistic entrepreneurs await a promised land of less red tape -- just as soon as Uncle Sam gets around to arranging it . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , they tackle the mounds of paper -- and fantasize about a dream world where bulk-mail postal regulations and government inspectors are banished . </s>
<s> To find out what red tape riles entrepreneurs most , the Journal asked a completely unscientific , random sample of business owners to fantasize about the forms and regulations they would most like to get lost in the mail . </s>
<s> Some entrepreneurs say the red tape they most love to hate is red tape they would also hate to lose . </s>
<s> They concede that much of the government meddling that torments them is essential to the public good , and even to their own businesses . </s>
<s> Rules that set standards for products or govern business behavior , generally the best regarded form of red tape , `` create a level playing field and keep unscrupulous competitors away , '' says Sidney West , president of TechDesign International Inc. , a Springfield , Va. , business that designs telecommunication and other products . </s>
<s> Mr. West cites the Federal Communications Commission and its standards for telecommunications equipment : `` They monitor product quality and prevent junk from flooding the market . '' </s>
<s> Some gripes about red tape are predictable : Architects complain about a host of building regulations , auto leasing companies about car insurance rules . </s>
<s> Determining when handicapped access is required can be a nightmare for architects , says Mark Dooling , president of Dooling & Co. , a Newton , Mass. , architectural firm . </s>
<s> There is such a maze of federal , state and local codes that `` building inspectors are backing away from interpreting them , '' Mr. Dooling says . </s>
<s> Taxi , leasing and other companies that maintain fleets of vehicles devote substantial resources to complying with state insurance laws and a host of agencies . </s>
<s> `` It 's very costly and time-consuming , '' says Phil Rosen , a partner in Fleet & Leasing Management Inc. , a Boston car-leasing company . </s>
<s> One senior executive at his firm spends nearly 20 % of his time on insurance , he says . </s>
<s> Other forms of red tape are more pervasive . </s>
<s> The most onerous , many entrepreneurs say , is the record-keeping and filing required by tax authorities . </s>
<s> Complying with environmental and workplace regulations runs a close second . </s>
<s> But gripes run the gamut . </s>
<s> Here is the red tape that irks surveyed business owners the most : </s>
<s> ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS : </s>
<s> Next to medical insurance , `` costs of compliance '' are the fastest-growing expense at Impco Inc. , a Providence , R.I. , chemical company . </s>
<s> Peter Gebhard , the company 's owner , says spending on regulatory paper work and the people to do it -- mostly to comply with federal , state and local environmental laws -- will rise almost 30 % this year to $ 100,000 . </s>
<s> Mr. Gebhard adds that spending on environmental red tape amounts to between 6.5 % and 7.5 % of Impco 's total operating expenses . </s>
<s> Eastern Reproduction Corp. , a Waltham , Mass. , maker of thin metal precision parts , must report to five federal and state agencies as well as to local fire , police , hospital and plumbing authorities , says Robert Maguire , president . </s>
<s> One state environmental regulator returned a report because `` it was n't heavy enough , it could n't have been correct , '' Mr. Maguire says . </s>
<s> WITHHOLDING RULES : </s>
<s> Employers must deposit withholding taxes exceeding $ 3,000 within three days after payroll -- or pay stiff penalties -- and that 's a big problem for small businesses . </s>
<s> It 's especially nettlesome `` if you 're on the road and you 're the one responsible , '' says Eddie Brown , president of Brown Capital Management Inc. , a Baltimore money-management firm . </s>
<s> EMPLOYEE MANUALS : </s>
<s> Revising employee manuals on pensions , health care and other subjects costs over $ 25,000 a year for Bert Giguiere , president of Professional Agricultural Management Inc. , a Fresno , Calif. , provider of business services to farmers . </s>
<s> An employer leaves itself open to a great deal of liability if its employee manuals do n't reflect the most recent laws , he says . </s>
<s> But the ever-changing laws are usually so complicated and confusing that `` you need professionals to help you ; you ca n't do it yourself , '' he adds . </s>
<s> PENSION AND PROFIT-SHARING RULES : </s>
<s> Complying with these is enough to make business owners look forward to their own pension days . </s>
<s> Yearly changes in federal benefit laws force small businesses to repeatedly re-evaluate and redesign existing plans . </s>
<s> Alice Fixx , who runs her own public-relations concern in New York , says she has had to overhaul her pension and profit-sharing plans three times in the past three years . </s>
<s> `` It does n't increase benefits , but it 's costly and time-consuming , '' Ms. Fixx says . </s>
<s> Compliance added 15 % to 20 % to her accounting bill last year , she says . </s>
<s> SALES TAX RECORDS : </s>
<s> Advertising agencies and other service companies are exempt from city and state sales tax in most locales -- but the exemption comes at a price of exhaustive records and rigorous reviews . </s>
<s> To justify their exempt status and avoid penalties , these businesses must show once a year that each and every transaction on which they did n't pay sales tax was a legitimate business expense . </s>
<s> `` You need one person to just take care of sales tax , '' says Jennie Tong , executive vice president of Lee Liu & Tong Advertising Inc. , New York . </s>
