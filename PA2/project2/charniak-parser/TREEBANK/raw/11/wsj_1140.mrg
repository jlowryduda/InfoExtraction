<s> Short interest in Nasdaq over-the-counter stocks rose 6 % as of mid-October , its biggest jump since 6.3 % last April . </s>
<s> The most recent OTC short interest statistics were compiled Oct. 13 , the day the Nasdaq composite index slid 3 % and the New York Stock Exchange tumbled 7 % . </s>
<s> The coincidence might lead to the conclusion that short-sellers bet heavily on that day that OTC stocks would decline further . </s>
<s> As it happens , the Nasdaq composite did continue to fall for two days after the initial plunge . </s>
<s> However , the short interest figures reported by brokerage and securities clearing firms to the National Association of Securities Dealers include only those trades completed , or settled , by Oct. 13 , rather than trades that occurred on that day , according to Gene Finn , chief economist for the NASD . </s>
<s> Generally , it takes five business days to transfer stock and to take the other steps necessary to settle a trade . </s>
<s> The total short interest in Nasdaq stocks as of mid-October was 237.1 million shares , up from 223.7 million in September but well below the record level of 279 million shares established in July 1987 . </s>
<s> The sharp rise in OTC short interest compares with the 4.2 % decline in short interest on the New York Stock Exchange and the 3 % rise on the American Stock Exchange during the September-October period . </s>
<s> Generally , a short seller expects a fall in a stock 's price and aims to profit by selling borrowed shares that are to be replaced later ; the short seller hopes the replacement shares bought later will cost less than those that were sold . </s>
<s> Short interest , which represents the number of shares borrowed and sold , but not yet replaced , can be a bad-expectations barometer for many stocks . </s>
<s> Among 2,412 of the largest OTC issues , short interest rose to 196.8 million shares , from 185.7 million in 2,379 stocks in September . </s>
<s> Big stocks with large short interest gains as of Oct. 13 included First Executive , Intel , Campeau and LIN Broadcasting . </s>
<s> Short interest in First Executive , an insurance issue , rose 55 % to 3.8 million . </s>
<s> Intel 's short interest jumped 42 % , while Campeau 's increased 62 % . </s>
<s> Intel makes semiconductors and Campeau operates department-store chains and is strained for cash . </s>
<s> Meritor Savings again had the dubious honor of being the OTC stock with the biggest short interest position on Nasdaq . </s>
<s> Meritor has headed the list since May . </s>
<s> First Executive and troubled Valley National Corp. of Arizona were next in line . </s>
<s> Short selling is n't necessarily bad for the overall market . </s>
<s> Shorted shares must eventually be replaced through buying . </s>
<s> In addition , changes in short interest in some stocks may be caused by arbitrage . </s>
<s> For example , an investor may seek to profit during some takeover situations by buying stock in one company involved and shorting the stock of the other . </s>
<s> Two big stocks involved in takeover activity saw their short interest surge . </s>
<s> Short interest in the American depositary receipts of Jaguar , the target of both Ford Motor and General Motors , more than doubled . </s>
<s> Nasdaq stocks that showed a drop in short interest included Adobe Systems , Class A shares of Tele-Communications and takeover targets Lyphomed and Jerrico . </s>
<s> The NASD , which operates the Nasdaq computer system on which 5,200 OTC issues trade , compiles short interest data in two categories : the approximately two-thirds , and generally biggest , Nasdaq stocks that trade on the National Market System ; and the one-third , and generally smaller , Nasdaq stocks that are n't a part of the system . </s>
<s> Short interest in 1,327 non-NMS securities totaled 40.3 million shares , compared with almost 38 million shares in 1,310 issues in September . </s>
<s> The October short interest represents 1.04 days of average daily trading volume in the smaller stocks in the system for the reporting period , compared with 0.94 day a month ago . </s>
<s> Among bigger OTC stocks , the figures represent 2.05 days of average daily volume , compared with 2.14 days in September . </s>
<s> The adjacent tables show the issues in which a short interest position of at least 50,000 shares existed as of Oct. 13 or in which there was a short position change of at least 25,000 shares since Sept. 15 -LRB- see accompanying tables -- WSJ Oct. 25 , 1989 -RRB- . </s>
