<s> Norfolk Southern Corp. directors authorized the railroad company to buy back as many as 45 million of its shares , which would have a current value of more than $ 1.7 billion . </s>
<s> The buy-back , coupled with a nearly completed earlier purchase of 20 million shares , would reduce shares outstanding by more than 26 % . </s>
<s> The Norfolk , Va. , company has 172.2 million shares outstanding . </s>
<s> In a statement , Arnold B. McKinnon , chairman and chief executive officer , noted that the new repurchase program `` should serve to enhance shareholder value . '' </s>
<s> A spokeswoman said the company will finance the buy-back with cash on hand , borrowing and `` cash Norfolk expects to generate . '' </s>
<s> Analysts said they expected the action , and investors applauded the move . </s>
<s> In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Norfolk Southern shares closed at $ 37.875 , up $ 1.125 . </s>
<s> Still , analysts do n't expect the buy-back to significantly affect per-share earnings in the short term . </s>
<s> `` The impact wo n't be that great , '' said Graeme Lidgerwood of First Boston Corp . </s>
<s> That is in part because of the effect of having to average the number of shares outstanding , she said . </s>
<s> In addition , Mrs. Lidgerwood said , Norfolk is likely to draw down its cash initially to finance the purchases and thus forfeit some interest income . </s>
<s> Longer term , however , the buy-back is expected to increase earnings , especially after 1990 , Mrs. Lidgerwood said . </s>
<s> Moreover , the extensive program in effect establishes a floor for the stock price , said Joel Price , analyst for Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette . </s>
<s> The buy-back `` is really a comfort to those who want to buy the stock that there is a -LCB- price -RCB- floor , '' he said . </s>
<s> `` At a certain price , if the management thinks -LCB- the stock -RCB- is cheap , they can go in and buy it . '' </s>
<s> Under the program , Norfolk plans to acquire shares in the open market . </s>
<s> Under the earlier plan , Norfolk was authorized in 1987 to buy up to 20 million shares . </s>
<s> It has purchased about 19 million of them . </s>
