<s> Few people are aware that the federal government lends almost as much money as it borrows . </s>
<s> From 1980 to 1988 , while federal budget deficits totaled $ 1.41 trillion , the government issued $ 394 billion of new direct loans and an additional $ 756 billion of new primary loan guarantees . </s>
<s> These figures omit secondary guarantees , deposit insurance , and the activities of Government-Sponsored Enterprises -LRB- a huge concern in its own right , as detailed on this page May 3 -RRB- . </s>
<s> Federal credit programs date back to the New Deal , and were meant to break even financially . </s>
<s> Since the 1950s , federal lending has experienced extraordinary growth in credit volume , subsidy rates , and policy applications , spurred on by the growth of government in general and budget gimmicks and deceptive management in particular . </s>
<s> As we will see , many of these obligations do n't show up as part of the federal deficit . </s>
<s> But recent events indicate that federal credit is out of control . </s>
<s> Student loan defaults remain high at about 12 % , and the program has been rocked by allegations of fraud and mismanagement . </s>
<s> Farmers Home Administration -LRB- FmHA -RRB- loans have turned into de facto giveaway programs ; losses over the next three years are expected to exceed $ 20 billion . </s>
<s> Defaults on Veterans Affairs loan guarantees have quadrupled in the past eight years . </s>
<s> Last month , the General Accounting Office reported that defaults in Federal Housing Administration guarantees were five times as high as previously estimated , and that FHA 's equity fell to minus $ 2.9 billion . </s>
<s> GAO 's findings are particularly troubling because the FHA has about $ 300 billion in obligations outstanding and had previously been considered one of the most financially secure credit programs . </s>
<s> Scores of other credit programs , subsidizing agriculture , small business , exporters , defense , energy , transportation and others , are less visible but in no better shape . </s>
<s> If the programs continue their present path , the potential government losses are staggering : The federal government holds $ 222 billion in direct loans outstanding and backs an additional $ 550 billion in primary guarantees . </s>
<s> -LRB- Secondary guarantees of pools of FHA - and VA-backed loans by the agency known as Ginnie Mae currently exceed $ 330 billion . -RRB- </s>
<s> Although external events have contributed to the morass , the principal causes of the current crisis are internal and generic to all programs . </s>
<s> To reduce the risks while still retaining the legitimate benefits these programs can provide , credit policy must : 1 . Use credit to improve the operation of capital markets , not to provide subsidies . </s>
<s> There is a fundamental conflict between providing a subsidy and maintaining the integrity of a credit program . </s>
<s> If the program is meant to provide a subsidy , collecting the debt defeats the original goal . </s>
<s> Thus , subsidized loans tend to turn into giveaway programs , with increasing subsidy and default rates over time . </s>
<s> To avoid this problem , government should issue credit only if it intends to use every legal method to collect . </s>
<s> In contrast , credit programs can be appropriate tools to improve the operation of capital markets . </s>
<s> For example , legal restrictions on interstate banking once inhibited the supply of credit to the agricultural sector . </s>
<s> Farm lending was enacted to correct this problem by providing a reliable flow of lendable funds . </s>
<s> However , this in no way justifies the huge government subsidies and losses on such loans . </s>
<s> Credit policy should separate these two competing objectives and eliminate aspects that provide the subsidy . </s>
<s> For example , student loans currently attempt to subsidize college attendance and mitigate problems created by the fact that students ' future earnings are not accepted as collateral . </s>
<s> The program provides highly subsidized loans to any student whose family earns less than a particular amount . </s>
<s> High default rates , a low interest rate , and government coverage of all interest costs while the student is in school make program costs extremely high . </s>
<s> Families that do not need the loan can make money simply by putting the loan in the bank and paying it back when the student graduates . </s>
<s> In contrast , a student loan program that was meant solely to correct capital-market imperfections would allow loans for any student , regardless of family income , at market or near-market rates . </s>
<s> While the student was in school , interest costs would either be paid by the student or added to the loan balance . </s>
<s> This program , combined with cash grants to needy students , would reduce program costs and much more effectively target the intended beneficiaries . </s>
<s> 2 . Provide better incentives . </s>
<s> Given the structure of most credit programs , it is surprising that default rates are not even higher . </s>
<s> Guarantee rates are typically 100 % , giving lenders little reason to screen customers carefully . </s>
<s> Reducing those rates moderately -LRB- say , to 75 % -RRB- would still provide substantial assistance to borrowers . </s>
<s> But it would also encourage lenders to choose more creditworthy customers , and go a long way toward reducing defaults . </s>
<s> For example , the Small Business Administration has had reasonable success in reducing both guarantee rates and default rates in its Preferred Lenders ' Program . </s>
<s> Borrowers ' incentives are equally skewed . </s>
<s> Since the government has a dismal record of collecting bad debts , the costs to the borrower of defaulting are usually low . </s>
<s> In addition , it is often possible to obtain a new government loan even if existing debts are not paid off . </s>
<s> Simple policy prescriptions in this case would be to improve debt collection -LRB- taking the gloves off contracted collection agencies -RRB- and to deny new credit to defaulters . </s>
<s> These provisions would be difficult to enforce for a program intended to provide a subsidy , but would be reasonable and effective devices for programs that attempt to offset market imperfections . </s>
<s> 3 . Record the true costs of credit programs in the federal budget . </s>
<s> Since the budget measures cash flow , a new $ 1 direct loan is treated as a $ 1 expenditure , even though at least part of the loan will be paid back . </s>
<s> Loan guarantees do n't appear at all until the borrower defaults , so new guarantees do not raise the deficit , even though they create future liabilities for the government . </s>
<s> By converting an expenditure or loan to a guarantee , the government can ensure the same flow of resources and reduce the current deficit . </s>
<s> Predictably , guarantees outstanding have risen by $ 130 billion since 1985 , while direct loans outstanding have fallen by $ 30 billion . </s>
<s> The true budgetary cost of a credit subsidy is the discounted value of the net costs to government . </s>
<s> This figure could be estimated using techniques employed by private lenders to forecast losses , or determined by selling loans to private owners -LRB- without federal guarantees -RRB- . </s>
<s> Neither technique is perfect , but both are better than the current system , which misstates the costs of new credit programs by amounts that vary substantially and average about $ 20 billion annually , according to the Congressional Budget Office . </s>
<s> A budget that reflected the real costs of lending would eliminate incentives to convert spending or lending programs to guarantees and would let taxpayers know what Congress is committing them to . </s>
<s> 4 . Impose standard accounting and administrative practices . </s>
<s> Creative accounting is a hallmark of federal credit . </s>
<s> Many agencies roll over their debt , paying off delinquent loans by issuing new loans , or converting defaulted loan guarantees into direct loans . </s>
<s> In any case , they avoid having to write off the loans . </s>
<s> Some agencies simply keep bad loans on the books ; as late as 1987 , the Export-Import Bank held in its portfolio at face value loans made to Cuba in the 1950s . </s>
<s> More seriously , FmHA has carried several billion dollars of defaulted loans at face value . </s>
<s> Until GAO 's recent audit , FHA books had not been subject to a complete external audit in 15 years . </s>
<s> The administration of federal credit should closely parallel private lending practices , including the development of a loan loss reserve and regular outside audits . </s>
<s> Establishing these practices would permit earlier identification of emerging financial crises , provide better information for loan sales and budgeting decisions , and reduce fraud . </s>
<s> Government lending was not intended to be a way to obfuscate spending figures , hide fraudulent activity , or provide large subsidies . </s>
<s> The reforms described above would provide a more limited , but clearer , safer and ultimately more useful role for government as a lender . </s>
<s> Without such reforms , credit programs will continue to be a large-scale , high-risk proposition for taxpayers . </s>
