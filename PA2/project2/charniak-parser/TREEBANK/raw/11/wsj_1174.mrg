<s> If bluebloods wo n't pay high prices for racehorses anymore , who will ? </s>
<s> Breeders are betting on the common folk . </s>
<s> The Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association , a Lexington , Ky.-based trade group , has launched `` seminars '' for `` potential investors '' at race tracks around the country . </s>
<s> The group , which has held half a dozen seminars so far , also is considering promotional videos and perhaps a pitch to Wall Street investment bankers . </s>
<s> `` People in this business have been insulated , '' says Josh Pons , a horse breeder from Bel Air , Md . </s>
<s> `` But the real future of this game is in a number of people owning a few horses . '' </s>
<s> At the Laurel race track , the breeders are romancing people like Tim Hulings , a beer packaging plant worker . </s>
<s> Right now , Mr. Hulings is waving his racing program , cheering for Karnak on the Nile , a sleek thoroughbred galloping down the home stretch . </s>
<s> Mr. Hulings gloats that he sold all his stocks a week before the market plummeted 190 points on Oct. 13 , and he is using the money to help buy a 45-acre horse farm . </s>
<s> `` Just imagine how exciting that would be if that 's your horse , '' he says . </s>
<s> But experts caution that this is n't a game for anyone with a weak stomach or wallet . </s>
<s> `` It 's a big-risk business , '' warns Charles C. Mihalek , a Lexington attorney and former Kentucky state securities commissioner . </s>
<s> `` You have to go into it firmly believing that it 's the kind of investment where you can lose everything . '' </s>
<s> And many have done just that . </s>
<s> Consider Spendthrift Farm , a prominent Lexington horse farm that went public in 1983 but hit hard times and filed for bankruptcy-court protection last year . </s>
<s> A group of investors recently bought the remaining assets of Spendthrift , hoping to rebuild it . </s>
<s> Other investors have lost millions in partnerships that bought thoroughbred racehorses or stallion breeding rights . </s>
<s> One big problem has been the thoroughbred racehorse market . </s>
<s> From 1974 to 1984 , prices for the best yearlings at the summer sales rose 918 % to an average of $ 544,681 . </s>
<s> Since then , prices have slumped , to an average of $ 395,374 this summer . </s>
<s> But that 's for the best horses , with most selling for much less -- as little as $ 100 for some pedestrian thoroughbreds . </s>
<s> Even while they move outside their traditional tony circle , racehorse owners still try to capitalize on the elan of the sport . </s>
<s> Glossy brochures circulated at racetracks gush about the limelight of the winner 's circle and high-society schmoozing . </s>
<s> One handout promises : `` Pedigrees , parties , post times , parimutuels and pageantry . '' </s>
<s> `` It 's just a matter of marketing and promoting ourselves , '' says Headley Bell , a fifth-generation horse breeder from Lexington . </s>
<s> Maybe it 's not that simple . </s>
<s> For starters , racehorse buyers have to remember the basic problem of such ventures : These beasts do n't come with warranties . </s>
<s> And for every champion , there are plenty of nags . </s>
<s> Katherine Voss , a veteran trainer at the Laurel , Md. , track , offers neophytes a sobering tour of a horse barn , noting that only three of about a dozen horses have won sizable purses . </s>
<s> One brown two-year-old filly was wheezing from a cold , while another had splints on its legs , keeping both animals from the racetrack . </s>
<s> `` You can see the highs and lows of the business all under one roof , '' she tells the group . </s>
<s> `` There are n't too many winners . '' </s>
<s> Perhaps the biggest hurdle owners face is convincing newcomers that this is a reputable business . </s>
<s> Some badly managed partnerships have burned investors , sometimes after they received advice from industry `` consultants . '' </s>
<s> So owners have developed a `` code of ethics , '' outlining rules for consultants and agents , and disclosure of fees and any conflicts of interest . </s>
<s> But some are skeptical of the code 's effectiveness . </s>
<s> `` The industry is based on individual honesty , '' says Cap Hershey , a Lexington horse farmer and one of the investors who bought Spendthrift . </s>
<s> Despite the drop in prices for thoroughbreds , owning one still is n't cheap . </s>
<s> At the low end , investors can spend $ 15,000 or more to own a racehorse in partnership with others . </s>
<s> At a yearling sale , a buyer can go solo and get a horse for a few thousand dollars . </s>
<s> But that means paying the horse 's maintenance ; on average , it costs $ 25,000 a year to raise a horse . </s>
<s> For those looking for something between a minority stake and total ownership , the owners ' group is considering a special sale where established horse breeders would sell a 50 % stake in horses to newcomers . </s>
