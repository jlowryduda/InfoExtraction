<s> And you thought the only reason to save your canceled checks was to prepare for an IRS audit . </s>
<s> Reggie Jackson , the retired baseball star , has found another use for them . </s>
<s> Mr. Jackson , who won the nickname `` Mr. October '' for his World Series exploits , is selling some of his canceled checks to autograph collectors through a dealer for as much as $ 500 each . </s>
<s> Dealers say the budding trade in Mr. Jackson 's canceled checks is unusual . </s>
<s> `` I do n't know of any living ballplayer that 's ever done it , '' says Jack Smalling , a dealer in Ames , Iowa , and a recognized expert in the field of baseball autographs . </s>
<s> An initial batch of Mr. Jackson 's checks was on sale at a baseball-card show held in San Francisco over Labor Day weekend . </s>
<s> Mr. Jackson showed up at the affair to sign autographs for a fee as well . </s>
<s> `` For someone who has everything else -- Reggie 's jersey , cap and cards -- his checks might be a nice addition , '' says William Vizas , owner of Bill 's Sports Collectibles in Denver , who examined the checks at the San Francisco card show . </s>
<s> For years , the canceled checks of a small number of well-known baseball players have been bought and sold . </s>
<s> But these players were dead . </s>
<s> `` Maybe three years ago , there were a lot of -LCB- Ty -RCB- Cobbs in the hobby , and awhile back there were Babe Ruth checks , '' says Mr. Smalling . </s>
<s> However , the thought of a living player selling his checks rubs some people the wrong way . </s>
<s> `` Maybe I 'm a little stuffy , but I would n't sell them , '' sniffs Bob Machon , owner of Papa 's Sports Cards in Menlo Park , Calif . </s>
<s> `` Who knows how much they 'll be worth 100 years from now ? '' </s>
<s> And Mr. Smalling does n't believe they 're worth all that much now . </s>
<s> `` I do n't think the checks are worth $ 15 apiece , '' he says . </s>
<s> Why Mr. Jackson , who could n't be reached for comment , has made some of his checks available for sale is n't clear . </s>
<s> He probably has n't done it for the cash . </s>
<s> `` I would say he 's definitely not in need of money , '' says Matt Merola , an agent of Mr. Jackson 's based in New York . </s>
<s> `` He has good investments . '' </s>
<s> And Mr. Jackson probably has opened new checking accounts , too . </s>
<s> Or at least he should . </s>
<s> `` I assume those accounts are closed , '' says Mr. Smalling , referring to the accounts of the canceled checks . </s>
<s> `` I do n't think he 'd want to give out his current account numbers . </s>
