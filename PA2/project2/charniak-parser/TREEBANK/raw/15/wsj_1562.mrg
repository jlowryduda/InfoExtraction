<s> ONCE YOU MAKE UP your mind about an investment , the rest is easy , right ? </s>
<s> You just call your broker and say `` buy '' or `` sell . '' </s>
<s> Dream on . </s>
<s> There are all sorts of ways to give buy and sell instructions to a broker -- and just as many ways to get burned if you do n't know what you 're doing . </s>
<s> So here 's a rundown of the most common types of market orders permitted by the stock and commodity exchanges . </s>
<s> Two things to keep in mind : Not all exchanges accept every type of order . </s>
<s> And even when a specific order is acceptable to an exchange , a brokerage firm can refuse to enter it for a customer . </s>
<s> Market Order : This is probably the most widely used order -- and the one most open to abuse by unscrupulous floor brokers , since it imposes no price restrictions . </s>
<s> With a market order , an investor tells a broker to buy or sell `` at the market . '' </s>
<s> It 's like saying , `` get me in now '' or `` get me out now . '' </s>
<s> For example , if wheat is being offered at $ 4.065 and bid at $ 4.060 , a market order to buy would be filled at the higher price and a market order to sell at the lower price . </s>
<s> A recent indictment alleges that some floor brokers at the two largest Chicago commodity exchanges used market orders to fill customers ' orders at unfavorable prices by arranging trades with fellow brokers . </s>
<s> Profits realized from these trades would then be shared by the conspiring brokers . </s>
<s> Limit Order : Limit orders are used when investors want to restrict the amount they will receive or pay for an investment . </s>
<s> Investors do this by specifying a minimum price at which the investment may be sold or the maximum price that may be paid for it . </s>
<s> Suppose an investor wants to sell a stock , but not for less than $ 55 . </s>
<s> A limit order to sell could be entered at that price . </s>
<s> One risk : Investors may regret the restriction if the stock reaches 54 and then falls . </s>
<s> Unless the market goes at least one tick -LRB- the smallest price increment permitted -RRB- beyond the limit price , investors are n't assured of having their orders filled because there may not be sufficient trading volume to permit filling it at the specified price . </s>
<s> Stop Order : Stop orders tell a floor broker to buy or sell an investment once the price reaches a certain level . </s>
<s> Once the price reaches that level , a stop order turns into a market order , and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get . </s>
<s> Stop orders are sometimes called `` stop-loss '' orders because they are frequently used to protect profits or limit losses . </s>
<s> While stop orders sound similar to limit orders , there is a difference : Sell stops must be entered at a price below the current market price and buy stops above . </s>
<s> In contrast , sell limit orders must be placed above the market price and buy limit orders are placed below . </s>
<s> The crash in October 1987 and last Friday 's sell-off painfully taught some investors exactly what stop orders will and wo n't do . </s>
<s> An investor who may have placed a stop-loss order at $ 90 under a stock that was trading at $ 100 a share on the Friday before the crash was stunned to discover that the order was filled at $ 75 when the stock opened at that price on Monday . </s>
<s> Stop-Limit Order : Stop-limit orders turn into limit orders when an investment trades at the price specified in the order . </s>
<s> Unlike stop orders -- which are filled at the market price when the stop price is hit -- stop-limit orders demand that the trades be made only at the specified price . </s>
<s> If it ca n't be made at that price , it does n't get filled . </s>
<s> Investors who wish to be out of a position , without the risk of receiving a worse-than-expected price from a market order , may use this type of order to specify the price at which the order must be filled . </s>
<s> But if the market moves quickly enough , it may be impossible for the broker to carry out the order because the investment has passed the specified price . </s>
<s> Market-If-Touched Order : Market-if-touched orders are like stop orders in that they become market orders if a specified price is reached . </s>
<s> However , unlike a buy-stop order , a buy market-if-touched order is entered at a price below the current price , while a sell market-if-touched order is entered at a price above it . </s>
<s> As soon as the market trades at the specified price the floor broker will fill it at the best possible price . </s>
<s> Fill-Or-Kill Order : The fill-or-kill order is one of several associated with the timing of trades . </s>
<s> It instructs a broker to buy or sell an investment at the specified price or better . </s>
<s> But if the investment ca n't be bought or sold immediately , the order is automatically canceled . </s>
<s> Gregory Bessemer , who came in second in the stock division of the recently completed U.S. Trading Championship , says he uses fill-or-kill orders almost exclusively when trading options . </s>
<s> `` I like to use them to feel out the market , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` If they do n't fill it immediately , then I can start over at a new price or try again with the same price . '' </s>
<s> Not-Held Order : This is another timing order . </s>
<s> It is a market order that allows floor brokers to take more time to buy or sell an investment , if they think they can get a better price by waiting . </s>
<s> Not-held orders , which are also known as `` disregard the tape '' orders , are always done at the customer 's risk . </s>
<s> One-Cancels-The-Other Order : This is really two orders in one , generally for the same security or commodity , instructing floor brokers to fill whichever order they can first and then cancel the other order . </s>
<s> In a fast-moving market , it prevents an investor from getting stuck with having made two trades on the same security . </s>
<s> Specific-Time Order : This type of order couples many of the orders described above with instructions that the order must be carried out at or by a certain time . </s>
<s> `` On the close '' can be added to many types of orders . </s>
<s> For example , `` market-on-close orders '' must be filled during the last few minutes of trading for the day at a price that is within the official closing range of prices as determined by the exchange . </s>
<s> `` Stop-close-only orders '' are stop orders that only become active during the closing minutes of trading . </s>
<s> `` Day orders '' expire at the end of the day on which they are entered , `` good-till-canceled orders '' have no expiration date . </s>
<s> Most brokers assume that all orders are day orders unless specified otherwise . </s>
<s> On Oct. 19 , 1987 , some investors learned the consequences of entering `` good-til-canceled limit orders '' and then forgetting about them . </s>
<s> They found they had bought stock from limit orders that they might have entered weeks or months earlier and had forgotten to cancel . </s>
<s> It is always the responsibility of investors to keep track of the orders they have placed . </s>
<s> Investors who change their mind about buying or selling after an order has been filled are , usually , stuck with the consequences . </s>
