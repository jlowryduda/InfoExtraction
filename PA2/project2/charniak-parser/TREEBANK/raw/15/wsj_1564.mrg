<s> READY TO REVIEW the riskiness of your investment portfolio ? </s>
<s> First , a pop quiz . </s>
<s> When you think of the words `` risk '' and `` investment , '' what 's the specific peril that comes to mind ? </s>
<s> Pencils down . </s>
<s> If you 're like most people , you said it 's a holding that goes completely sour -- maybe a bond that defaults or a stock whose value disappears in a bankruptcy proceeding . </s>
<s> `` People tend to see risk primarily on that one dimension , '' says Timothy Kochis , national director of personal financial planning for accountants Deloitte , Haskins & Sells . </s>
<s> But therein lies another aspect of investment risk : the hazard of shaping your portfolio to avoid one or more types of risk and being blind-sided by others . </s>
<s> This is clearly not good news to all you people who sleep like babies every night , lulled by visions of your money sitting risk-free in six-month CDs . </s>
<s> Risk wears many disguises , and investments that are low in one type of obvious risk can be distressingly high in other , less obvious kinds . </s>
<s> U.S. Treasury bonds , for example , are supersafe when it comes to returning money at maturity . </s>
<s> But their value as investments can be decimated by inflation , which erodes the purchasing power of bonds ' fixed-dollar interest payments . </s>
<s> Risk is also a function of time . </s>
<s> When financial professionals measure risk mathematically , they usually focus on the volatility of short-term returns . </s>
<s> Stocks are much riskier than Treasury bills , for example , because the range in performance from the best years to the worst is much wider . </s>
<s> That is usually measured by the standard deviation , or divergence , of annual results from the average return over time . </s>
<s> But investors who are preoccupied with short-term fluctuations may be paying too little attention to another big risk -- not generating enough money to meet long-term financial and life-style goals . </s>
<s> For instance , some investors have sworn off stocks since the 1987 market crash ; last Friday 's debacle only reinforced those feelings . </s>
<s> But the stock market , despite some stomach-churning declines , has far outperformed other securities over extended periods . </s>
<s> By retreating to the apparent security of , say , money-market funds , investors may not be earning enough investment return to pay for a comfortable retirement . </s>
<s> `` That 's the biggest risk of all -- the risk of not meeting your objectives , '' says Steven B. Enright , a New York financial planner with Seidman Financial Services . </s>
<s> As a result , financial advisers say they take several steps when evaluating the riskiness of clients ' portfolios . </s>
<s> They estimate the return a person 's current portfolio is likely to generate over time , along with a standard deviation that suggests how much the return will vary year by year . </s>
<s> They try to figure out the long-term results the person needs to meet major goals . </s>
<s> And they eyeball types of risk that are not easily quantified . </s>
<s> The portfolios of two hypothetical families , one a couple at retirement age and another a two-income couple at age 45 , illustrate several types of risk that investors need to consider . </s>
<s> For instance , the insured municipal bonds that dominate the older couple 's portfolio were probably selected in large part for their low repayment risk . </s>
<s> But they expose the holders to a lot of inflation risk and interest-rate risk . </s>
<s> The younger couple 's stockholdings involve more risk than a diversified stock portfolio because the bulk of the money is in a single issue . </s>
<s> Note that the younger couple 's portfolio has a higher expected annual return , 10.1 % vs. 8.8 % , as calculated by Seidman Financial Services , which is the financial-planning affiliate of BDO Seidman . </s>
<s> That largely reflects the heavy stockholdings . </s>
<s> But one price paid for the higher expected return is greater short-term volatility , as reflected in the higher standard deviation that Seidman estimates for the younger couple 's portfolio . </s>
<s> -LRB- Here 's how to interpret a standard deviation figure : Take the expected return and add one standard deviation to it . </s>
<s> Then take the expected return and subtract one standard deviation . </s>
<s> In two of three years , the actual result should fall within that range if all the assumptions were accurate . </s>
<s> Then add and subtract two standard deviations to get a wider range . </s>
<s> There 's a 95 % probability any year 's result will fall in the range . -RRB- </s>
<s> Of course , the greater volatility of the younger couple 's portfolio does n't necessarily mean those investments are riskier in terms of meeting the holders ' long-term goals . </s>
<s> Indeed , the older couple 's portfolio could actually be riskier in that sense if the expected return wo n't generate enough dollars to meet their spending plans . </s>
<s> `` They may feel emotionally secure now because they are not heavily in the stock market , '' says John H. Cammack , a financial planner with Alexandra Armstrong Advisors Inc. in Washington . </s>
<s> `` But they may pay a price 10 or 20 years in the future . '' </s>
<s> Ms. Slater reports on personal finance from The Wall Street Journal 's New York bureau . </s>
<s> When it comes to investing , trying to weigh risk and reward can seem like throwing darts blindfolded : Investors do n't know the actual returns that securities will deliver , or the ups and downs that will occur along the way . </s>
<s> Looking to the past can provide some clues . </s>
<s> Over several decades , for instance , investors who put up with the stock market 's gyrations earned returns far in excess of those on bonds and `` cash '' investments like Treasury bills . </s>
<s> But while history can suggest what is reasonable to expect there 's no guarantee that the past will repeat itself . </s>
<s> For instance , some analysts believe bond returns and volatility have moved permanently closer to those of the stock market . </s>
<s> And returns on cash investments may continue to exceed inflation by a wider margin than they did over the long-term past . </s>
<s> Portfolio A : Retired couple , age 65 ; $ 400,000 portfolio . </s>
<s> Portfolio B : Two-income couple , age 45 ; $ 150,000 portfolio . </s>
