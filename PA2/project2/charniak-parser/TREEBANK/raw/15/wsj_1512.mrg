<s> The government issues its first reading on third-quarter real gross national product this week in a report that is expected to disclose much tamer inflation . </s>
<s> The consensus view on real GNP , the total value of the nation 's output of goods and services adjusted for inflation , calls for a 2.3 % gain , down from the second quarter 's 2.5 % , according to MMS International , a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc. , New York . </s>
<s> But inflation , as measured by the GNP deflator in Thursday 's report , is expected to rise only 3.5 % , down from 4.6 % in the second quarter . </s>
<s> `` Inflation could be a real surprise , '' said Samuel D. Kahan , chief financial economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc. , in Chicago . </s>
<s> `` If that gets people excited , it could serve as an impetus to the fixed-income markets to lower their rates , '' he added . </s>
<s> The week 's other notable indicators include mid-October auto sales , September durable goods orders as well as September personal income , personal consumption and the saving rate . </s>
<s> Most are expected to fall below previous-month levels . </s>
<s> Many economists see even slower GNP growth for the remainder of the year , with some leaning more strongly toward a possible recession . </s>
<s> In addition to softer production data , weaker housing starts and lower corporate profits currently in evidence , some analysts believe the two recent natural disasters -- Hurricane Hugo and the San Francisco earthquake -- will carry economic ramifications in the fourth quarter . </s>
<s> The recent one-day , 190-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average seems to be significant to economists mainly for its tacit comment on the poor quality of third-quarter profits now being reported . </s>
<s> `` The stock market is sick because profits are crumbling , '' says Michael K. Evans , president of Evans Economics Inc. , Washington . </s>
<s> The economy , he noted , moves the market , not vice versa . </s>
<s> On the other hand , Mr. Evans expects the hurricane and the earthquake `` to take a hunk out of fourth-quarter GNP . '' </s>
<s> His estimate of 3.3 % for third-quarter GNP is higher than the consensus largely because he believes current inventories are n't as low as official figures indicate . </s>
<s> Demand , he believes , is being met from overhang rather than new production . </s>
<s> By and large , economists believe the two natural catastrophes will limit economic damage to their regions . </s>
<s> Edward J. Campbell , economist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. , New York , noted that large increases in construction activity along with government and private relief efforts could offset loss of production in those areas . </s>
<s> Gary Ciminero , economist at Fleet\/Norstar Financial Group , Providence , R.I. , expects the deflator to rise 3.7 % , well below the second quarter 's 4.6 % , partly because of what he believes will be temporarily better price behavior . </s>
<s> He expects real GNP growth of only 2.1 % for the quarter , noting a wider trade deficit , slower capital and government spending and the lower inventory figures . </s>
<s> Sung Won Sohn , chief economist at Norwest Corp. , Minneapolis , holds that the recent stock-market volatility `` increases the possibility of economic recession and reinforces the bad news '' from recent trade deficit , employment and housing reports . </s>
<s> The consensus calls for a 0.5 % increase in September personal income and a 0.3 % gain in consumption . </s>
<s> In August , personal income rose 0.4 % and personal consumption increased 0.9 % . </s>
<s> Charles Lieberman , managing director of financial markets reasearch at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. , New York , said Hurrican Hugo shaved 0.1 % to 0.2 % from personal-income growth , because of greatly diminished rental income from tourism . </s>
<s> Durable goods orders for September , due out tomorrow , are expected to show a slip of 1 % , compared with August 's 3.9 % increase . </s>
<s> As usual , estimates on the fickle report are wide , running from a drop of 3.5 % to a gain of 1.6 % . </s>
