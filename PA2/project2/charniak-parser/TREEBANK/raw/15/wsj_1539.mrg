<s> SciMed Life Systems Inc. , Minneapolis , said a federal appeals court vacated an earlier summary judgment in its favor . </s>
<s> A lower court in St. Paul had ruled in September 1988 that a heart catheter SciMed manufactures does n't infringe on a patent owned by Advanced Cardiovascular Systems , a unit of Eli Lilly & Co . </s>
<s> SciMed said the appeals court remanded the case back to the district court for further proceedings . </s>
<s> In national over-the-counter trading Friday , SciMed shares tumbled $ 2.75 to $ 43 . </s>
<s> SciMed said it `` remains committed '' both to the `` vigorous defense '' of its position that the catheter does n't infringe the Lilly unit 's patent , and to the pursuit of its own counterclaims , which allege Lilly engaged in antitrust violations and other wrongful acts . </s>
