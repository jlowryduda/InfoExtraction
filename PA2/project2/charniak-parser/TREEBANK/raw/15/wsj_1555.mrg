<s> Hewlett-Packard Co. will announce today a software program that allows computers in a network to speed up computing tasks by sending the tasks to each other . </s>
<s> Called Task Broker , the program acts something like an auctioneer among a group of computers wired together . </s>
<s> If a machine has a big computing task , Task Broker asks other computers in the network for `` bids '' on the job . </s>
<s> It then determines which machine is free to do the task most quickly and sends the task to that machine . </s>
<s> Hewlett-Packard claims that the software allows a network to run three times as many tasks as conventional networks and will run each task twice as fast . </s>
<s> The new Hewlett-Packard program , said analyst John McCarthy at Forrester Research Inc. , a computer-market research company , `` is a key building block as people move to this new model of distributed processing . '' </s>
<s> In today 's computer networks , some machines often sit idle while others are overtaxed . </s>
<s> With the Hewlett-Packard program , he said , `` You get more bang for the buck you 've spent on computers . '' </s>
<s> The program , which will be shipped in January 1990 , runs on the Unix operating system . </s>
<s> Hewlett-Packard will charge $ 5,000 for a license covering 10 users . </s>
<s> The program now works on all Hewlett-Packard and Apollo workstations and on computers made by Multiflow Computer Inc. of Branford , Conn . </s>
<s> Hewlett-Packard said it will sell versions later next year that run on Sun Microsystems Inc. and Digital Equipment Corp. machines . </s>
<s> The Task Broker differs from other programs that spread computing tasks around a network . </s>
<s> A previously available program called Network Computing System , developed by Hewlett-Packard 's Apollo division , for instance , takes a task and splits it up into parts , divvying up those parts to several computers in a network for simultaneous processing . </s>
<s> But programs in individual computers must be revised in order to work with that system . </s>
<s> Applications wo n't have to be rewritten to work with Task Broker , Hewlett-Packard said , and the user of a computer wo n't be able to tell that another machine is doing the work . </s>
<s> The Task Broker `` turns that network into -- as far as the user is concerned -- one giant computer , '' said Bill Kay , general manager of Hewlett-Packard 's workstation group . </s>
