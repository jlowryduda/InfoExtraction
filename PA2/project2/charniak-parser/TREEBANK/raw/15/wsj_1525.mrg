<s> `` Please submit your offers , '' says Felipe Bince Jr . </s>
<s> He surveys the prospective investors gathered in the board room of the Philippine government 's Asset Privatization Trust for the sale of a 36 % interest in the country 's largest paper mill . </s>
<s> The agency expects the bids to be equivalent of more than $ 80 million . </s>
<s> Not a peso is offered . </s>
<s> Mr. Bince , the trust 's associate executive trustee , declares the bidding a failure . </s>
<s> `` It 's getting harder to sell , '' he mutters as he leaves the room . </s>
<s> Indeed . Recently , the trust failed to auction off the paper mill , a bank , an office building and a small cotton-ginning plant . </s>
<s> Of the four , only the bank and the plant drew bids -- one apiece . </s>
<s> In October 1987 , President Corazon Aquino vowed that her government would `` get out of business '' by selling all or part of the state 's holdings in the many companies taken over by the government during the 20-year rule of Ferdinand Marcos . </s>
<s> Two years later , Mrs. Aquino 's promise remains largely unfulfilled . </s>
<s> October is a critical month for the privatization program . </s>
<s> Manila is offering several major assets for the first time and is trying to conclude sales already arranged . </s>
<s> In addition , the government is scheduled to unveil plans for privatizing Philippine Airlines , the national carrier , an effort that lawyer and business columnist Rodolfo Romero calls `` the bellwether of privatization . '' </s>
<s> All told , there are assets on the line valued at up to $ 1.03 billion . </s>
<s> The privatization program is designed to rid the government of hundreds of assets and to raise critically needed funds . </s>
<s> Much of the money from the sales is earmarked for a multibillion-dollar agrarian-reform program . </s>
<s> But efforts have been thwarted by official indifference , bureaucratic resistance , a legal system that operates at a snail 's pace , political opposition and government misjudgments . </s>
<s> Most recently , a lack of buyers has been added to the list . </s>
<s> Rather than gathering momentum , the program is in danger of slowing even more as the government tackles several big assets . </s>
<s> The axiom appears to be that the more valuable the asset , the harder the privatization process . </s>
<s> `` You just do n't see a whole lot happening , '' says an international economist . </s>
<s> To be sure , the program has n't completely stalled . </s>
<s> The Asset Privatization Trust , the agency chiefly responsible for selling government-held properties , has recorded sales of more than $ 500 million since it began functioning in December 1986 . </s>
<s> But its success has been largely in the sale of small , nonperforming companies , which are valued for their assets . </s>
<s> Dealing with the sales this month could be particularly challenging because almost every problem that has hobbled the program in the past is popping up again . </s>
<s> Ramon Garcia , the Asset Trust 's executive trustee , admits to what he calls `` temporary setbacks . '' </s>
<s> In light of the poor results recently , he says , the agency is adopting an `` attitude of flexibility . '' </s>
<s> October 's troubles began when the trust failed to sell a state-owned commercial bank , Associated Bank , for the minimum price of 671 million pesos -LRB- $ 31 million -RRB- . </s>
<s> At the end of the month , the agency again will offer the bank . </s>
<s> But instead of a minimum price , only a target price will be established . </s>
<s> Bankers say , however , that the government may have difficulty selling the institution even without a floor price . </s>
<s> The bank has a negative net worth , they say . </s>
<s> In addition , special bidding rules give the bank 's former owner , Leonardo Ty , the right to match the highest bid . </s>
<s> Mr. Ty lost control to the government in 1980 when a government bank made emergency loans to the cash-strapped institution . </s>
<s> In 1983 , the loans were converted into equity , giving Manila 98 % of the bank , but with the understanding that Mr. Ty had repurchase rights . </s>
<s> His ability to match any bid has scared off many potential buyers . </s>
<s> Separately , the government will try again within a month to sell the 36 % stake in Paper Industries Corp. of the Philippines , or Picop , as the paper mill is known . </s>
<s> The price will depend on how much Picop shares fetch on the local stock market . </s>
<s> But according to bankers and stock analysts who have studied the paper mill , price is n't the only consideration . </s>
<s> As it stands now , the government would continue to hold 45 % of Picop after the 36 % stake is sold . </s>
<s> -LRB- About 7.5 % of Picop is publicly traded and other shareholders own the rest of the equity . -RRB- </s>
<s> Potential buyers , mostly foreign companies , are reluctant to take a non-controlling stake in a company that , by the government 's own reckoning , needs some $ 100 million in new capital for rehabilitation . </s>
<s> The prospect of buying into a cash-hungry company without getting management control persuaded at least three foreign buyers , including a member of the Elders group of Australia , to pull out of the bidding , the bankers and analysts say . </s>
<s> Mr. Garcia acknowledges the problem and says the Asset Trust will study why the bidding failed and what changes the agency may be able to offer . </s>
<s> Under government regulations , however , foreign ownership of Picop 's equity is limited to 40 % . </s>
<s> Even though the government would retain the 45 % stake in Picop , critics have accused the trust of selling out to foreigners . </s>
<s> A series of newspaper articles accused the trust of short-changing the government over the Picop sale . </s>
<s> Mr. Garcia says he has been notified of congressional hearings on the Picop bidding and possible legislation covering the paper mill 's sale , both prompted by the criticism of the agency . </s>
<s> The question of control could further hinder long-delayed plans for the government to divest itself of Philippine Airlines , in which it has a 99 % stake . </s>
<s> The carrier has valuable trans-Pacific and Asian routes but it remains debt-laden and poorly managed . </s>
