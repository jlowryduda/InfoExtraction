<s> At the ritzy Fashion Island Shopping Center , the tanned and elegant ladies of this wealthy Southern California beach community disembark from their Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs for another day of exercising their credit cards . </s>
<s> They root among the designer offerings at Neiman-Marcus and Bullocks Wilshire . </s>
<s> They stroll through the marble-encased corridors of the Atrium Court . </s>
<s> They graze at the Farmers Market , a combination gourmet food court and grocery store , while a pianist accompanies the noon fashion show with a selection of dreamy melodies . </s>
<s> `` The beautiful look of wool , '' croons the show 's narrator , `` slightly Victorian in its influence ... . '' </s>
<s> Meanwhile , in the squat office buildings that ring Fashion Island , the odds are good that someone is getting fleeced . </s>
<s> Law-enforcement authorities say that at any given time , a host of fraudulent telemarketing operations mingle with the many legitimate businesses here . </s>
<s> `` They seem to like these industrial parks , '' says Kacy McClelland , a postal inspector who specializes in mail fraud . </s>
<s> `` We call them fraud farms . '' </s>
<s> Welcome to that welter of contradictions known as Newport Beach . </s>
<s> This city of more than 70,000 is known for sunshine , yachts and rich residents . </s>
<s> It is also known as the fraud capital of the U.S. , dubbed by investigators and the media as the `` Cote de Fraud '' . </s>
<s> How does a community famous for its high living end up as a haven for low-lifes ? </s>
<s> Clearly , the existence of the former lures the latter . </s>
<s> The places renowned for breeding bunco , like the Miami neighborhood known as the `` Maggot Mile '' and Las Vegas 's flashy strip of casinos , invariably offer fast cars , high rollers , glamorous women and lots of sunshine . </s>
<s> You do n't hear much about unusual concentrations of fraud in Green Bay or Buffalo . </s>
<s> Con men hate snow . </s>
<s> Newport Beach fits the scam artists ' specifications perfectly . </s>
<s> What more could a con man in search of the easy life ask for ? </s>
<s> Nothing seems hard here . </s>
<s> The breezes are soft , the waves lap gently and the palm trees sway lazily . </s>
<s> Nightlife is plentiful . </s>
<s> Moreover , ostentation is appreciated . </s>
<s> The median price of homes is $ 547,000 ; more than 9,000 vessels fill what the chamber of commerce calls the nation 's largest pleasure-boat harbor . </s>
<s> `` Blondes , cocaine and Corvettes , '' mutters Mr. McClelland . </s>
<s> `` That 's what they 're after . '' </s>
<s> The rich image of Newport Beach also helps lend the con artists ' operation an air of respectability . </s>
<s> `` One reason they use Newport Beach is that it sounds swankier than most addresses , '' says David Katz , a U.S. attorney who , until recently , headed a multi-agency Southern California fraud task force . </s>
<s> `` Newport Beach is known in Rhode Island for having a lot of rich people . '' </s>
<s> No wonder all kinds of big-time scams have flourished here , from phony tax-sheltered Bible sales to crooked car dealers to bogus penny-stock traders . </s>
<s> But above all , this is the national headquarters for boiler-room operators , those slick-talking snake-oil salesmen who use the telephone to extract money from the gullible and the greedy and then vanish . </s>
<s> Because only a fraction of them are ever prosecuted , nobody really knows how much money bogus telemarketing operators really harvest . </s>
<s> `` I 've heard that there is $ 40 billion taken in nationwide by boiler rooms every year , '' Mr. McClelland says . </s>
<s> `` If that 's true , Orange County has to be at least 10 % of that . '' </s>
<s> And most of the truly big scams in Orange County seem to originate in Newport Beach or one of the other well-heeled communities that surround this sliver-like city that hooks around a point of land on the California coast south of Los Angeles . </s>
<s> In fact , sophisticated big-bucks boiler-room scams are known generically among law-enforcement types as `` Newport Beach '' operations . </s>
<s> That contrasts with the penny-ante sales of things such as pen-and-pencil sets and office supplies that are known as `` Hollywood '' scams . </s>
<s> Newport Beach telemarketers concentrate on precious metals and oil-leasing deals that typically cost thousands of dollars a shot . </s>
<s> The investors range from elderly widows to affluent professionals . </s>
<s> In one ingenious recent example of a Newport Beach boiler room , prospective investors in Capital Trust Inc. were allegedly told that their investment in precious metals was insured against losses `` caused by employees due to dishonesty , destruction or disappearance , '' according to an indictment handed up by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles last month . </s>
<s> Thus falsely reassured , investors sent $ 11.4 million to the Newport Beach company , most of which was diverted to unauthorized uses , the indictment charges . </s>
<s> Douglas Jones , an attorney representing Richard O. Kelly Sr. , the chairman and president of Capital Trust , says his client denies that there was any attempt to defraud investors . </s>
<s> `` There were some business deals that went bad , '' Mr. Jones says , `` but no intent to defraud . '' </s>
<s> Newport Beach operations differ from the Hollywood boiler rooms in style as well as in dollars . </s>
<s> Traditionally , boiler rooms operate on the cheap , since few , if any , customers ever visit their offices . </s>
<s> Indeed , the name derives from the tendency among telemarketing scammers to rent cheap basement space , near the boiler room . </s>
<s> But , says Mr. Katz , the U.S. attorney , `` the interesting thing about Newport Beach operations is that they give themselves the indulgence of beautiful offices , with plush furnishings . </s>
<s> When we go there , it 's quite different from these Hollywood places where the sandwiches are spread out on the table and the people are picking their noses . '' </s>
<s> The Newport Beach operators also tend to indulge themselves privately . </s>
<s> Investigators cite the case of Matthew Valentine , who is currently serving a six-year sentence at Lompoc Federal Prison for his role in Intech Investment Corp. , which promised investors returns of as much as 625 % on precious metals . </s>
<s> Mr. Valentine , who pleaded guilty to five counts of fraud in federal court in Los Angeles , drove a leased Mercedes and lived in an expensive home on Lido Isle , an island in Newport 's harbor , according to investigators . </s>
<s> With the $ 3 million received from investors , he took frequent junkets with friends to exotic locales and leased an expensive BMW for his girlfriend , whom he met at the shop where he got his custom-tailored suits . </s>
<s> `` It 's amazing the amount of money that goes up their nose , out to the dog track or to the tables in Las Vegas , '' Mr. Katz says . </s>
<s> All this talk of boiler rooms and fraud is unnerving to the city 's legitimate business element . </s>
<s> Vincent M Ciavarella , regional manager of Property Management Systems , insists he does n't know of any bogus telemarketers operating in the 1.6 million square feet of office space around Fashion Island that his company leases for Irvine Co. , the owner and developer of the project . </s>
<s> Mr. Ciavarella has rejected a few prospective tenants who provided `` incomplete '' financial information and acknowledges that illegitimate operators `` are not easily detectable . </s>
<s> '' -LRB- Investigators stress that building owners are victims , too , since boiler rooms often leave without paying rent . -RRB- </s>
<s> Richard Luehrs , president of the Newport Harbor Area Chamber of Commerce , calls boiler rooms a `` negative we wish we could get rid of . '' </s>
<s> Actually , `` we do n't get much negative publicity about this , '' he insists , `` except for the press who write about it . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Lancaster is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal 's Dallas bureau . </s>
