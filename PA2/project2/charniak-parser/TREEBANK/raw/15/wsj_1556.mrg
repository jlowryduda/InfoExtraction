<s> Price wars between the fast-food giants are starting to clobber the fast-food little guys : the franchisees . </s>
<s> `` When elephants start fighting , ants get killed , '' says Murray Riese , co-owner of National Restaurants , a New York franchisee for Pizza Hut , Roy Rogers and other chains . </s>
<s> As hamburger and pizza outlets saturate one area after another , franchisers are struggling desperately for market share , slashing prices and stepping up costly promotions . </s>
<s> The fight is putting a tight squeeze on profits of many , threatening to drive the smallest ones out of business and straining relations between the national fast-food chains and their franchisees . </s>
<s> The chains `` used to offer discounts during winter when business was slow , but in the last year or so , discounting has become a 12-month thing , '' says Donald Harty , president of Charisma Group Inc. , a New York franchisee of Grand Metropolitan PLC 's Burger King chain . </s>
<s> Though Charisma 's sales are up slightly this year , Mr. Harty says profits will be flat or lower . </s>
<s> And Bill Konopnicki , a Safford , Ariz. , licensee of McDonald 's Corp. who is chairman of the company 's National Operators Advisory Board , says some fast-food outlets `` could be in serious trouble , based on the amount of discounting that seems to be going on . '' </s>
<s> Until recently , the huge fast-food industry , with sales of about $ 60.1 billion last year , kept price-skirmishing to a minimum . </s>
<s> But early this year , PepsiCo Inc. 's Taco Bell unit and Wendy 's International Inc. slashed prices and stepped up promotions , says John Rohs , an analyst for Wertheim Schroder & Co . </s>
<s> That brought a chain reaction in the industry . </s>
<s> The situation was further aggravated early this month , when McDonald 's set plans to heat up the discounting by offering coupons . </s>
<s> It also decided to go national with pizza , which it has been test-marketing . </s>
<s> Now , two-for-one deals on pizza are common ; so are 99-cent specials on sandwiches normally priced twice as high . </s>
<s> The discounting , say fast-food operators , occurs on a scale and with a frequency they have n't seen before . </s>
<s> The result is that some franchisees are running hard just to stay even , laying off middle managers and working harder to make less . </s>
<s> Joe Mack , a district manager for Cormack Enterprises Inc. , a Burger King operator in Omaha , Neb. , says discounting is so prevalent that `` we have to serve 15 % to 20 % more customers '' to keep sales level . </s>
<s> `` It 's almost as if you 're doing extra work to give away the food , '' he says . </s>
<s> Alan D'Agosto , president of Panda 's Inc. , an operator of Arby 's restaurants in Omaha , says : `` All we 're doing is keeping the customers coming , but we are n't increasing sales . '' </s>
<s> With fast-food outlets on every corner , he , like many , does n't think he has a choice in the price war : `` Our customers say that they wo n't go into a fast-food store unless they get a coupon . '' </s>
<s> If the battle continues much longer , many fast-food businesses will close or merge , predicts Vincent Morrissey , who owns a string of Kentucky Fried Chicken stores in the Midwest . </s>
<s> `` The industry is overbuilt , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` Fast-food franchisers have managed to squeeze in stores into every corner available . '' </s>
<s> The National Restaurant Association says quick-service restaurant units in the U.S. rose 14 % to 131,146 between 1983 and 1987 , the last year for which figures are available . </s>
<s> With the market so crowded , says a spokesman for Wendy 's in Columbus , Ohio , `` If you 're doing well , you 're doing well at someone else 's expense . '' </s>
<s> Simply put , there is n't enough business for every store to grow . </s>
<s> According to Mr. Rohs , inflation-adjusted , same-store sales at company-owned Wendy 's units in the U.S. have trailed year-earlier levels throughout 1989 , except for August . </s>
<s> `` McDonald 's has also been running negative all year , '' the analyst says . </s>
<s> Spokesmen for Wendy 's and McDonald 's criticized Mr. Rohs 's calculations . </s>
<s> Jack Greenberg , executive vice president and chief financial officer of McDonald 's , says the company does n't compute , much less disclose , inflation-adjusted , same-store sales . </s>
<s> He adds that short-term comparisons `` can be very misleading because of differences in timing of marketing programs from year to year . '' </s>
<s> Profit margins at company-owned McDonald 's outlets in the U.S. `` are holding up quite nicely , '' says Mr. Greenberg . </s>
<s> Profits of franchisees have n't been higher since the mid-1970s , he adds . </s>
<s> But Mr. Greenberg 's sanguine outlook is n't matched by many fast-food industry observers . </s>
<s> Smaller chains and single-store operators will be the first to fail , many in the industry predict . </s>
<s> Big franchise groups `` can ride out the storm a lot longer , '' says Mr. Harty , the Burger King operator in New York . </s>
<s> The prolonged price pressures are driving a wedge between some franchisers and their franchisees . </s>
<s> Mr. Morrissey , the Kentucky Fried Chicken franchisee , notes that most franchise owners must absorb increases in expenses without any cut in the royalties , or portion of sales , that they must pay franchisers . </s>
<s> Franchisees ca n't be forced to go along with a franchiser 's discounting . </s>
<s> But once a franchisee agrees to a promotional program , the franchiser can demand full participation to the very end , says Lew Rudnick , a principal of Rudnick & Wolfe , a Chicago law firm with franchise industry clients . </s>
<s> He says courts have held that antitrust considerations are outweighed in such cases by the need to protect consumers from deceptive marketing . </s>
<s> In any case , many franchisees , in order to stay on good terms with franchisers , routinely go along with promotions . </s>
<s> Says Mr. Riese of National Restaurants : `` If you resisted on prices , maybe you would never get that telephone call about a new franchise . </s>
