<s> Nelson Bunker Hunt 's attempted corner on silver a decade ago is still haunting the market in this metal . </s>
<s> Silver , now trading around $ 5 an ounce , surged to an all-time peak of $ 50 an ounce in January 1980 from around $ 9 in mid-1979 . </s>
<s> `` Mr. Hunt 's attempt to squeeze the silver market 10 years ago is still indirectly to blame for today 's market depression , '' says Lesley Edgar , managing director of Sharps Pixley Ltd. , London bullion brokers . </s>
<s> While some 100 million ounces of silver once held by Mr. Hunt and Middle Eastern associates are n't hanging over the market anymore , the price surge of 1979-80 precipitated an expansion of mine production and scrap recovery and encouraged silver consumers to economize on silver use , Mr. Edgar says . </s>
<s> Photographic developers , for example , bought equipment to recover silver from spent photographs , negatives and processing solutions . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , the photographic industry , which accounts for 44 % of silver consumption , continues to look for substitutes . </s>
<s> Japanese and U.S. photographic firms are beginning to produce electronic cameras and X-rays that do n't require silver , dealers say . </s>
<s> Silver 's history of volatility is also discouraging investors , dealers say . </s>
<s> Even in the present uncertain investment climate , investors are preferring `` quality assets '' such as Treasury bills and bonds to gold , silver and platinum , dealers say . </s>
<s> Although prices rallied briefly following the tumble on world stock markets earlier this month and the related decline of the dollar , precious metals are out of favor for the moment because of high interest rates and a determination by industrial nations to curb inflation , dealers say . </s>
<s> Silver , however is in a deeper slump than are gold and platinum . </s>
<s> Some analysts contend that silver is cheap now that prices are languishing at levels last seen in the mid-1970s . </s>
<s> `` Bargain hunters believe that silver offers the best value amongst precious metals , '' says Frederick R. Demler , analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc . </s>
<s> A further decline in prices will lead to mine production cuts in the U.S. , he says . </s>
<s> Scrap merchants are converting smaller quantities of metal into silver , while low prices are discouraging exports from India and the Soviet Union . </s>
<s> Silver prices could also be boosted by strikes in leading producing nations Peru and Mexico , Mr. Demler says . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , total fabrication demand for silver has risen six years in a row , he says . </s>
<s> Japanese demand grew by 70 % in the first half of this year and the nation plans an issue of a silver commemorative coin that will require 4.5 million ounces . </s>
<s> Compared with huge annual surpluses of more than 100 million ounces in the first half of the 1980s , world silver supplies and consumption are now nearly in balance , Mr. Demler says . </s>
<s> Despite intermittent rallies in the past few years , improvements in the supply-demand balance have n't managed to push silver prices into a higher range . </s>
<s> `` There 's just too much silver around , '' says Tom Butler , an analyst at Samuel Montagu & Co. , a London bullion house . </s>
<s> A huge silver stockpile at exchanges , refiners , consuming industries and government warehouses of at least 617 million ounces is the market depressant , says Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in a report . </s>
<s> This year alone , inventories at the Commodity Exchange of New York jumped `` by a staggering 46 million to 221 million ounces '' because of producer deliveries , de-stocking by fabricators and sales by disenchanted investors , says Rhona O'Connell , London-based precious metals analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton . </s>
<s> `` Silver production is also in an inexorable upward trend , '' Ms. O'Connell says . </s>
<s> Moreover , while Asian and Middle Eastern investors hoard gold and help underpin its price , silver does n't have the same mystique , dealers say . </s>
<s> Investors have gotten burned on silver so often that they are far more partial to gold , says Urs Seiler , senior vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland . </s>
<s> Yet if gold prices improve , silver prices could rally sharply , he says . </s>
<s> However , dealers caution that any increase would be $ 1 to $ 2 at most . </s>
<s> Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week : </s>
<s> Livestock and Meats </s>
<s> Analysts expect the prices of live cattle futures contracts to rise in trading today in the wake of a government quarterly census that found fewer-than-expected cattle on feedlots . </s>
<s> After the close of trading Friday , the Agriculture Department reported that feedlots in the 13 biggest ranch states held 8.06 million cattle on Oct. 1 , down 6 % from that date a year earlier . </s>
<s> Most analysts had expected the government to report a 4 % decline . </s>
<s> Feedlots fatten young cattle for slaughter , so a decline signals a tightening supply of beef . </s>
<s> The government reported that the number of young cattle placed on feedlots during the quarter dropped 5 % compared with the year-earlier quarter . </s>
<s> Many industry analysts had been projecting a 3 % decline in placements for the quarter . </s>
<s> In the 1988 quarter , many farmers were forced to sell their cattle to feedlot operators because the drought dried out the pasture on their ranches . </s>
<s> The number of cattle moving onto feedlots in the recent quarter was also lower because fattening cattle is less profitable . </s>
<s> A shortage of young cattle has made them more expensive for feedlot operators to buy . </s>
<s> The Agriculture Department also said that the number of fattened cattle slaughtered in the quarter dropped by 5 % from the 1988 quarter , which was in line with projections by analysts . </s>
<s> Energy </s>
<s> Friday 's 44-cent-a-barrel price drop to $ 19.98 in the expiring November contract for West Texas Intermediate crude may well set the tone for trading this week in petroleum futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange . </s>
<s> Most traders and analysts attributed the decline to technical factors associated with the contract 's going off the board . </s>
<s> Others said that the drop continued the downward correction that 's been due in the petroleum pits and that such a trend could well continue in the next several trading sessions . </s>
<s> Barring any petroleum-related news events , trading in the days ahead should further test recent projections by oil economists and other market watchers that strong fourth-quarter demand will keep prices firm . </s>
<s> Copper </s>
<s> Copper prices fell sharply Friday afternoon . </s>
<s> For example , copper for December delivery settled 4.5 cents lower at $ 1.2345 a pound . </s>
<s> Pressure came from several developments including the settlement of two long-term strikes . </s>
<s> On Friday , one analyst said , rank-and-file workers ratified a new labor agreement ending a three-month strike at the Highland Valley mine in British Columbia . </s>
<s> In Mexico , the analyst added , employees at the Cananea mine , who have been out of work since late August when the mine was declared bankrupt by the government , accepted a 35 % cut in the 3,800-man work force . </s>
<s> The mine is expected to return to production in about a week . </s>
<s> On Friday , selling dominated the afternoon `` curb '' session in London , which takes place at noon EDT . </s>
<s> The premium of cash copper to the three-month forward offerings narrowed , indicating weaker demand for cash copper . </s>
<s> Long-term support for the December contract was believed to be at $ 1.25 a pound . </s>
<s> A technical analyst said there were a number of stop-loss orders under that level that were touched off when the contract 's price fell below it . </s>
<s> That brought in considerable fund selling , which continued until the close of trading . </s>
<s> `` In general , it was a bearish close , '' said Ben Hanauer , a copper trader at Rudolph Wolff & Co. , a major commodities trading and brokerage firm . </s>
<s> But whether this price break has implications for this week , he said , `` we will know more when the London Metal Exchange copper stock levels are released Monday morning . '' </s>
<s> Another analyst said he expected LME inventories to be down by about 15,000 tons when the weekly report is issued . </s>
<s> Bernard Savaiko , senior commodities analyst at PaineWebber Inc. , said that when traders saw the market was n't reacting positively to the forecasts of lower LME stocks , they perceived a bearish sign . </s>
<s> He also noted that the Japanese , who had been buying at prices just above the $ 1.25 level , apparently pulled back from the market on Friday . </s>
<s> Mr. Savaiko said he sees a possibility of the December contract dropping to $ 1.05 a pound . </s>
