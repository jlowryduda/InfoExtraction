<s> Guillermo Ortiz 's Sept. 15 Americas column , `` Mexico 's Been Bitten by the Privatization Bug , '' is a refreshingly clear statement of his government 's commitment to privatization , and must be welcomed as such by all Americans who wish his country well . </s>
<s> The Mexico-United States Institute is glad to see such a high official as Mexico 's undersecretary of finance view his country 's reforms `` in the context of a larger , world-wide process '' of profound change toward free-market economics , especially in the statist countries . </s>
<s> Having said that , we must caution against an apparent tendency to overstate the case . </s>
<s> It is not quite true , for example , that the Mexican government has `` privatized '' Mexicana de Aviacion , as Mr. Ortiz claims . </s>
<s> In the same sentence he contradicts himself when he reports that the government still retains 40 % of the total equity of the airline . </s>
<s> How can a company be considered `` privatized '' if the state is so heavily represented in it ? </s>
<s> -LRB- True , the Mexican government has granted `` control '' over the airline to a new private consortium , but its propensity to take back what it gives is too well known to permit one to be sanguine . -RRB- </s>
<s> Regrettably , too , Mr. Ortiz resorts to the familiar `` numbers game '' when he boasts that `` fewer than 392 -LCB- state enterprises -RCB- currently remain in the public sector , '' down from the `` 1,155 public entities that existed in 1982 . </s>
<s> '' But the enterprises still in state hands include the biggest and most economically powerful ones in Mexico ; indeed , they virtually constitute the economic infrastructure . </s>
<s> I refer essentially to petroleum , electric power , banking and newsprint . </s>
<s> Those enterprises , however , are not going to be privatized . </s>
<s> They are officially considered `` strategic , '' and their privatization is prohibited by the Mexican Constitution . </s>
<s> In language that sidesteps the issue , Mr. Ortiz writes , `` The divestiture of nonpriority and nonstrategic public enterprises is an essential element of President Carlos Salinas 's plan to modernize Mexico 's economy ... . '' </s>
<s> Yet clearly , modernization must embrace its key industries before it can be said to have caught the `` privatization bug . '' </s>
<s> The bottom line , however , is not economic but political reform . </s>
<s> A long succession of Mexican presidents arbitrarily nationalized whatever industry they took a fancy to , without having to answer to the public . </s>
<s> To guarantee that Mexicana de Aviacion and other companies will really be privatized , Mexico needs a pluri-party political system that will ensure democracy and hence accountability . </s>
