<s> After 20 years of pushing labor proposals to overhaul the nation 's health-care system , Bert Seidman of the AFL-CIO is finding interest from an unlikely quarter : big business . </s>
<s> Corporate leaders , frustrated by double-digit increases in health-care costs , are beginning to sound like liberal Democrats . </s>
<s> Failure to check rising medical costs ultimately could `` lead some of us who today are free-market advocates to re-examine our thinking and positions with respect to government-sponsored national health insurance , '' Arthur Puccini , a General Electric Co. vice president , warned earlier this year . </s>
<s> The pocketbook impact of health benefits has driven business and labor to a surprising consensus . </s>
<s> Both the AFL-CIO and the National Association of Manufacturers are calling for measures to control rising costs , improve quality and provide care to the 31 million Americans who currently lack health insurance . </s>
<s> Agreement on these points is a long way from a specific program , and nobody expects the U.S. to rush toward radical restructuring of the health-care system . </s>
<s> But there are signs that labor-management cooperation could change the politics of health-care legislation and the economics of medicine . </s>
<s> `` I ca n't remember a time when virtually everyone can agree on what the problem is , '' says Mr. Seidman , who heads the AFL-CIO 's department dealing with health matters . </s>
<s> Because the Bush administration is n't taking the initiative on health issues , business executives are dealing with congressional Democrats who champion health-care revision . </s>
<s> `` Business across the country is spending more time addressing this issue , '' says Sen. Edward Kennedy -LRB- D. , Mass . -RRB- . </s>
<s> `` It 's a bottom-line issue . '' </s>
<s> Business complained earlier this year when Sen. Kennedy introduced a bill that would require employers to provide a minimum level of health insurance to workers but does n't contain cost-control measures . </s>
<s> Partly in response , a bipartisan group of senators from the finance and labor committees is drafting a plan to attract broader support . </s>
<s> It will feature a cost-containment provision designed to keep expanded benefits from fueling higher care prices . </s>
<s> At 11.1 % of gross national product , U.S. health costs already are the highest in the world . </s>
<s> By contrast , Japan 's equal 6.7 % of GNP , a nation 's total output of goods and services . </s>
<s> Management and labor worry that the gap makes U.S. companies less competitive . </s>
<s> Chrysler Corp. estimates that health costs add $ 700 to the price of each of its cars , about $ 300 to $ 500 more per car than foreign competitors pay for health . </s>
<s> `` The cost of health care is eroding standards of living and sapping industrial strength , '' complains Walter Maher , a Chrysler health-and-benefits specialist . </s>
<s> Labor is upset because many companies are using higher employee insurance premiums , deductibles and co-payments to deflect surging medical costs to workers . </s>
<s> Health benefits are contentious issues in the strikes against Pittston Co. and Nynex Corp . </s>
<s> In their new contract this year , American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and the Communications Workers of America agreed to look for `` prompt and lasting national solutions '' to rising health-care costs . </s>
<s> Some analysts are cynical about the new corporate interest in health-care overhaul . </s>
<s> Carl Schramm , president of the Health Insurance Association of America , scoffs at `` capitalists who want to socialize the entire financing system '' for health . </s>
<s> `` They hope they can buy some government cost discipline , '' but this is a false hope , Mr. Schramm says . </s>
<s> He asserts that government has done an even worse job of controlling its health bill than business . </s>
<s> So far neither the Bush administration nor Congress is prepared to lead the way toward revamping health care . </s>
<s> The administration lacks a comprehensive health-care policy . </s>
<s> Congress still is struggling to dismantle the unpopular Catastrophic Care Act of 1988 , which boosted benefits for the elderly and taxed them to pay for the new coverage . </s>
<s> A bipartisan commission established by Congress and headed by Sen. John Rockefeller -LRB- D. , W.Va . -RRB- is scheduled to present new plans for dealing with the uninsured and long-term care for the elderly by next March 1 . </s>
<s> A quadrennial commission appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan is taking a broad look at the economics of Medicare for the elderly , Medicaid for the poor and the health system in general . </s>
<s> It is expected to report next summer . </s>
<s> `` No magic bullet will be discovered next year , an election year , '' says Rep. Fortney Stark -LRB- D. , Calif . -RRB- </s>
<s> But 1991 could be a window for action . </s>
<s> The pressure for change will rise with costs . </s>
<s> `` I think employers are really going to be the ones to push for major change , '' says Sharon Canner , a health expert at NAM . </s>
<s> Any major attempt to revamp the health-care system is likely to trigger opposition from politically powerful interest groups , particularly the American Medical Association , and perhaps from the public as well , if Congress takes steps that patients fear will limit the availability of care . </s>
<s> The NAM embraces efforts , which both the administration and the medical profession have begun , to measure the effectiveness of medical treatments and then to draft medical-practice guidelines . </s>
<s> Advocates hope that such standards will improve treatment while limiting unnecessary tests and medical procedures . </s>
<s> HHS Secretary Sullivan estimates that as much as 25 % of the medical procedures performed each year may be inappropriate or unnecessary . </s>
<s> Limiting care wo n't be easy or popular . </s>
<s> `` To slow the rise in total spending , it will be necessary to reduce per-capita use of services , '' the NAM warns in a policy statement . </s>
<s> This will `` require us to define -- and redefine -- what is ` necessary ' or ` appropriate ' care . </s>
<s> This involves trade-offs and -LCB- it -RCB- cuts against the grain of existing consumer and even provider conceptions of what is ` necessary . ' '' </s>
<s> The AFL-CIO also embraces treatment guidelines . </s>
<s> In addition , it 's toying with an approach that would impose health-expenditure ceilings or budgets on the government as a whole and on individual states as a way to slow health-care spending . </s>
<s> At a meeting here on Nov. 15 , the labor federation plans to launch a major effort to build grass-roots support for health-care overhaul . </s>
