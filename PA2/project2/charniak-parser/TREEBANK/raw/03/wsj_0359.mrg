<s> Wary investors have been running for the stock market 's equivalent of bomb shelters , buying shares of gold-mining and utility companies . </s>
<s> Those two groups have recently been leading the list of stocks setting new highs . </s>
<s> On Friday , when only a dozen common stocks hit 52-week highs on the New York Stock Exchange , five were gold-mining issues , and another four were utilities . </s>
<s> On Monday , when a mere seven common stocks managed new highs , six were utilities or golds . </s>
<s> At first glance , gold and utilities seem strange bedfellows . </s>
<s> After all , gold prices usually soar when inflation is high . </s>
<s> Utility stocks , on the other hand , thrive on disinflation , because the fat dividends utilities pay look more attractive when prices are falling -LRB- or rising slowly -RRB- . </s>
<s> But the two groups have something very important in common : They are both havens for scared money , stocks for people who hate stocks . </s>
<s> It 's as if investors , the past few days , are betting that something is going to go wrong -- even if they do n't know what . </s>
<s> If the stock market and the economy catch their breath and show that they 're on firmer footing , these stocks might well fall back . </s>
<s> Indeed , that happened to some extent yesterday , as industrial stocks rebounded , partly on news of takeovers in the paper industry . </s>
<s> Still , a lot of investors clearly have revived their interest in gold and utility shares . </s>
<s> `` The primary overriding thing is that people are frightened , '' says Martin Sass , a New York money manager . </s>
<s> `` The aftershocks of Oct. 13 -LRB- when the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 190 points -RRB- are still reverberating . '' </s>
<s> Certainly , the Oct. 13 sell-off did n't settle any stomachs . </s>
<s> Beyond that , money managers and analysts see other problems . </s>
<s> Inventories are creeping up ; car inventories are already high , and big auto makers are idling plants . </s>
<s> Takeover fever has cooled , removing a major horse from the market 's cart . </s>
<s> Britain 's unsettled political scene also worries some investors . </s>
<s> `` The gyrations in the British government '' add political uncertainty on top of high inflation and a ragged stock market , says John Hoffman , assistant director of research at Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co . </s>
<s> `` One of the three major markets in the world is getting chewed up pretty bad . '' </s>
<s> `` If the Fed does not come to the rescue and produce lower short-term interest rates over the next 30 days , the market 's going to flounder , '' says Larry Wachtel , a market analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities . </s>
<s> With this sort of sentiment common , it 's natural for investors to seek out `` defensive '' investments . </s>
<s> Utilities are a classic example : Even in recessions , people continue to use electric power , water and gas at a fairly steady rate . </s>
<s> Such defensive issues as food , tobacco , and drug stocks have been in favor for some time . </s>
<s> But many of these stocks have now become expensive . </s>
<s> Mr. Wachtel points to Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc. as examples : They 're selling for 18 to 22 times estimated 1990 per-share earnings . </s>
<s> Gold stocks are n't cheap on this basis , either , with many selling for 20 times earnings or more . </s>
<s> Even utility stocks are n't all that inexpensive , at an average of 14 times earnings . </s>
<s> But the two groups represent a further step in defensiveness . </s>
<s> If gold stocks and utilities continue to lead , it may signal that the market is in for rough times . </s>
<s> That 's just what Joseph Granville expects . </s>
<s> `` We are going to explode lower , '' says the flamboyant market seer , who had a huge following a few years back . </s>
<s> `` Anyone telling you to buy stocks in this market is technically irresponsible . </s>
<s> You do n't want to own anything long except gold stocks . '' </s>
<s> One reason for his gloom is a weekly tally he keeps of stocks within a point of hitting new highs or lows . </s>
<s> Last Friday , 96 stocks on the Big Board hit new 12-month lows . </s>
<s> But by Mr. Granville 's count , 493 issues were within one point of such lows . </s>
<s> Robert Stovall , a veteran New York money manager and president of Stovall\/Twenty-First Securities , has money in both gold and utility issues . </s>
<s> `` I think we could very well have -LCB- an economic -RCB- slowdown , beginning very soon if not already , '' he says . </s>
<s> Mr. Stovall does n't expect an actual recession . </s>
<s> But he does expect `` a muffler dragger '' of an economy , with `` very slow growth , maybe one quarter of no growth at all . '' </s>
<s> In such a climate , utility stocks look good to him . </s>
<s> He favors FPL Group Inc. , Florida Progress Corp. , TECO Energy Inc. , Wisconsin Energy Corp. , and Dominion Resources Inc . </s>
<s> The appeal of gold issues , Mr. Stovall says , is that `` they 're a counter group . </s>
<s> You go into them because they move counter to the general market . '' </s>
<s> He adds that gold stocks had been down so long they were `` ready for a bounce . '' </s>
<s> His favorites are American Barrick Resources Corp. , Echo Bay Mines Ltd. and Coeur d'Alene Mines Corp . </s>
<s> Nevertheless , Mr. Stovall emphasizes that `` you do n't buy -LCB- gold stocks -RCB- based on powerful fundamentals . '' </s>
<s> In addition to having high price-earnings ratios , most pay puny dividends , if any . </s>
<s> `` The earning power -LCB- of gold mining companies -RCB- is restricted unless the gold price hops up over $ 425 an ounce , '' he says . </s>
<s> Abby Cohen , an investment strategist for Drexel Burnham Lambert , also thinks it makes sense to have some money in both utilities and gold . </s>
<s> `` My outlook is for a decline of about 10 % in corporate profits '' in 1990 , she says . </s>
<s> But `` a bunch of utilities '' should post profit increases . </s>
<s> Among utilities , Drexel currently favors Entergy Corp. and General Public Utilities Corp . </s>
<s> As for gold , she notes that it usually rises when the dollar is weak , as it has been lately . </s>
<s> Among gold stocks , Drexel likes Battle Mountain Gold Co. , Newmont Gold Co. and Freeport-McMoRan Gold Co . </s>
