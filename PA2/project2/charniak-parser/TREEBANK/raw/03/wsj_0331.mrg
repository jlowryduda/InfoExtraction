<s> Santa Fe Pacific was the kind of story Wall Street loved . </s>
<s> Since the value of its assets was n't known , analysts were free to pick a number . </s>
<s> In one of many rosy scenarios , Bear Stearns 's Gary Schneider wrote in March that its real estate alone had a value of $ 4.5 billion . </s>
<s> Throw in its railroad , minerals , pipeline and oil assets , he and others argued , and the Chicago-based conglomerate should be worth 30 a share . </s>
<s> And why should holders expect to realize that presumed `` worth ? '' </s>
<s> That was another reason the Street loved Santa Fe . </s>
<s> With real estate experts Olympia & York and Samuel Zell 's Itel owning close to 40 % of Santa Fe 's stock , management was under pressure -- in a favored phrase of Wall Street -- to quickly `` maximize values . '' </s>
<s> But value , it turns out , is only what a buyer will pay . </s>
<s> And with the company 's recent announcement that it is contemplating a partial sale of its real estate , the values suddenly look poorer . </s>
<s> Santa Fe has disclosed that it is negotiating to sell a 20 % interest in its real estate unit to the California Public Employees Retirement System for roughly $ 400 million . </s>
<s> Since the real estate unit also includes debt , the imputed value of the real estate itself is close to $ 3 billion . </s>
<s> `` The implied current net asset value of 22.70 -LCB- per share -RCB- is well below the 30 level that the Street believed , '' PaineWebber says . </s>
<s> `` The upside was in the intangible real estate ... which is no longer an intangible . '' </s>
<s> So what is Santa Fe worth ? </s>
<s> If the railroad is valued on a private market basis -- at the same multiple of earnings as in the recent sale of CNW -- it would have a value of $ 1.65 billion . </s>
<s> A compromise between bulls and bears puts remaining assets and cash -- including its 44 % stake in its publicly traded pipeline -- at $ 2 billion . </s>
<s> Santa Fe also has $ 3.7 billion in debt . </s>
<s> In addition , its railroad lost a $ 750 million antitrust suit , which is on appeal , and which analysts say could be settled for one-third that amount . </s>
<s> That nets out to about $ 17 a share for the company on a private market basis . </s>
<s> But Santa Fe , currently trading at 18 7\/8 , is n't likely to realize private market values by selling assets , because the tax against it would be onerous . </s>
<s> Its plan , instead , is to spin off the remainder of its real estate unit and to possibly do the same with its mining and energy assets . </s>
<s> Robert D. Krebs , Santa Fe 's chairman , argues that since its businesses are valued in different ways , `` the sum of the parts may be greater than the whole . '' </s>
<s> But it is n't clear why that should be so . </s>
<s> The spinoff argument , after all , reverses the current notion that assets are worth more to private buyers than to public shareholders . </s>
<s> And real estate usually has n't traded well under public ownership . </s>
<s> Salomon Brothers says , `` We believe the real estate properties would trade at a discount ... after the realty unit is spun off ... . </s>
<s> And what about the cost , and risk , of waiting to realize the hypothetical private market values ? '' </s>
<s> Some analysts remain bullish . </s>
<s> Mr. Schneider of Bear Stearns says he is recalculating the worth of the company 's assets and , in the meantime , is sticking to his `` buy '' recommendation on the belief that he will find `` values '' of 30 a share . </s>
<s> He adds : `` If for any reason I do n't have the values , then I wo n't recommend it . '' </s>
<s> First Boston 's Graeme Anne Lidgerwood values Santa Fe at 24 , down from her earlier estimate of 29 . </s>
<s> Her recent report classifies the stock as a `` hold . '' </s>
<s> But it appears to be the sort of hold one makes while heading for the door . </s>
<s> Quoting from the report : `` The stock 's narrow discount to asset valuation makes it a relatively unappealing investment at current prices , especially given the risk that our projections could be on the aggressive side . '' </s>
<s> Chairman Krebs says the California pension fund is getting a bargain price that would n't have been offered to others . </s>
<s> In other words : The real estate has a higher value than the pending deal suggests . </s>
<s> Since most of the unit 's real estate is in California , the pension fund will be a useful political ally in a state where development is often held hostage to zoning boards . </s>
<s> And , as Mr. Zell says , with Itel and O&Y on the unit 's board , the real estate will be run by `` a very unusual group '' to say the least . </s>
<s> It is possible then that Santa Fe 's real estate -- even in a state imperiled by earthquakes -- could , one day , fetch a king 's ransom . </s>
<s> But as Drexel analyst Linda Dunn notes , its properties will be developed over 15 to 20 years . </s>
<s> So despite Wall Street 's rosy talk of quickly `` maximizing values , '' holders could be in for a long wait . </s>
