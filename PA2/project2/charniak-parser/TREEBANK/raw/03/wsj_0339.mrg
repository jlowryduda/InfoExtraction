<s> -LRB- During its centennial year , The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history . -RRB- </s>
<s> LUTHER BURBANK CROSS-BRED PLANTS to produce the billion-dollar Idaho potato . </s>
<s> Bioengineers set out to duplicate that feat -- scientifically and commercially -- with new life forms . </s>
<s> In 1953 , James Watson and his colleagues unlocked the double helix of DNA -LRB- deoxyribonucleic acid -RRB- , the genetic key to heredity . </s>
<s> Twenty years later , two California academics , Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer , made `` recombinant '' DNA , transplanting a toad 's gene into bacteria , which then reproduced toad genes . </s>
<s> When Boyer met Robert Swanson , an M.I.T.-trained chemist-turned-entrepreneur in 1976 , they saw dollar signs . </s>
<s> With $ 500 apiece and an injection of outside capital , they formed Genentech Inc . </s>
<s> Commercial gene-splicing was born . </s>
<s> Genentech 's first product , a brain protein called somatostatin , proved its technology . </s>
<s> The next to be cloned , human insulin , had market potential and Genentech licensed it to Eli Lilly , which produced 80 % of the insulin used by 1.5 million U.S. diabetics . </s>
<s> Their laboratory credentials established , Boyer and Swanson headed for Wall Street in 1980 . </s>
<s> At the time , Genentech had only one profitable year behind it -LRB- a modest $ 116,000 on revenue of $ 2.6 million in 1979 -RRB- and no product of its own on the market . </s>
<s> Nonetheless , the $ 36 million issue they floated in 1980 opened at $ 35 and leaped to $ 89 within 20 minutes . </s>
<s> The trip from the test tube was not without snags . </s>
<s> Boyer and Cohen , for instance , both still university researchers , had to be talked into applying for a patent on their gene-splicing technique -- and then the Patent Office refused to grant it . </s>
<s> That judgment , in turn , was reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court , leaving Cohen and Boyer holding the first patents for making recombinant DNA -LRB- now assigned to their schools -RRB- . </s>
<s> Gene-splicing now is an integral part of the drug business . </s>
<s> Genentech 's 1988 sales were $ 335 million , both from licensing and its own products . </s>
