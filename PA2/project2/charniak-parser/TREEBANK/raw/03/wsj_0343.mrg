<s> Senate leaders traded proposals aimed at speeding action on legislation to narrow the deficit and raise the federal government 's debt limit -- but the major stumbling block remains President Bush 's proposal to cut the capital-gains tax rate . </s>
<s> Democrats want the tax provision to be a separate bill , subject to the usual procedural obstacles . </s>
<s> Republicans , meanwhile , want to try to protect the measure by combining it with two politically popular issues that Democrats could find hard to block . </s>

<s> Last night , after meeting with Mr. Bush and administration officials at the White House , Mr. Dole proposed streamlining the fiscal 1990 deficit-reduction bill , now stalled in a House-Senate conference committee , and passing a long-term extension of the federal debt ceiling without any accompanying amendments . </s>

<s> Senate Democrats are to meet today to consider the GOP proposal . </s>
<s> Yesterday , Mr. Dole seemed weary of the Bush administration 's strategy of pushing the capital-gains measure at every chance in the face of Democratic procedural hurdles . </s>
