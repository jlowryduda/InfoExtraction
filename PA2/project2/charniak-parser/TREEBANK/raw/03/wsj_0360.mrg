<s> It never ceases to amaze me how the business world continues to trivialize the world 's environmental problems -LRB- `` Is Science , or Private Gain , Driving Ozone Policy ? '' by George Melloan , Business World , Oct. 24 -RRB- . </s>
<s> To suggest that a 10 % drop in ozone by the middle of the next century would be negligible is irresponsible and shortsighted . </s>
<s> Consider the fact that a mere 2 % drop in ozone would increase birth defects and mutations by allowing solar radiation to alter the DNA structure . </s>
<s> Even a small reduction is unacceptable and to suggest otherwise is penny-wise and pound-foolish . </s>
<s> The reason environmentalists `` do n't mind seeing new crises arise '' is because there are new crises . </s>
<s> Crises larger and more dangerous to the quality of life than they were 10 years ago . </s>
<s> If you are doubtful , consider for a moment that the Pomton Lakes Reservoirs in northern New Jersey , which supply the tristate area with drinking water , are riddled with toxic PCBs . </s>
<s> This is a fact and not the product of some environmental doomsayer or a group 's ploy to create a market . </s>
<s> It 's time business leaders and the general public learn that mankind does not rule over this natural environment but is rather the integral , symbiotic player within nature 's workings . </s>

<s> Mr. Melloan 's column was right on the money , but I wish it could have gone one step further . </s>
<s> As an employee of a major refrigerator and freezer manufacturer , I have been heavily involved in dealing with the political manifestations of the Rowland-Molina theory -LRB- named after the researchers who found in 1974 that chlorofluorocarbons contributed to the depletion of ozone in the earth 's atmosphere -RRB- and the Montreal Protocol . </s>
<s> An important part of my effort has been to understand the science so I can explain it to corporate colleagues facing major changes in product design . </s>
<s> In my research , I have found a paper by Joseph Scotto of the National Cancer Institute and several colleagues reporting an 11-year decrease in UV-B radiation at eight U.S. measurement sites . </s>
<s> Our concern for the ozone layer , of course , grows out of the potential for increasing UV-B radiation , which could damage flora and fauna . </s>
<s> The last of the measurements reported was in 1985 , but recent conversations with Mr. Scotto indicated that he knew of no recent changes in the trend . </s>
<s> I understand , but have n't yet verified , that there are studies by Norwegians , Russians and the Max Planck Institute that show either unchanging or declining UV-B at the surface . </s>
<s> To me , this calls into question the validity of the Rowland-Molina theory and hence the whole chlorofluorocarbons replacement effort . </s>
<s> This , in turn , threatens the massive vested interests of which you have written . </s>
<s> My questions on this subject at a recent meeting at the World Resources Institute with representatives of the National Resource Development Commission , the Environmental Protection Agency , Friends of the Earth , etc. were greeted with derision and some mumbled comments about that report being discredited . </s>
<s> When I expressed amazement that no one was undertaking a more current and credible UV-B study , I was urged to get back to the agenda topic , which was , ironically , a schedule for getting rid of HCFCs , the so-called soft CFCs that are such an important part of the CFC substitution scenario . </s>
<s> Subsequently , I have learned that a private group , of which Du Pont is a part , is funding a modest program to continue data gathering at the Scotto report stations as well as to develop more sophisticated UVB measuring instruments . </s>
<s> But this is almost an underground activity . </s>
<s> To my knowledge , no government entities , including the EPA , are pursuing UV-B measurements . </s>
<s> The topic never comes up in ozonedepletion `` establishment '' meetings , of which I have attended many . </s>
<s> It seems to me that such measurements are a vital part of any intellectually honest evaluation of the threat posed by CFCs . </s>
<s> While recognizing that professional environmentalists may feel threatened , I intend to urge that UV-B be monitored whenever I can . </s>

<s> The relationship between surface release of CFCs and global stratospheric ozone loss was identified back in 1974 . </s>
<s> Although , like all scientific theories , it had its initial opponents , few experts question the connection now . </s>
<s> The discovery of the ozone `` hole '' over Antarctica and the results of ground-based and high-altitude aircraft experiments conducted over the past several years serve as evidence that ozone depletion is related to CFC concentrations . </s>
<s> In the September issue of Scientific American , Thomas E. Graedel , distinguished member of the technical staff at AT&T Bell Laboratories , and Paul J. Crutzen , director of the air chemistry division of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz , West Germany , wrote , `` It is now quite evident that chlorofluorocarbons , particularly CFC-11 and CFC-12 are the major culprits responsible for ozone depletion . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Melloan quotes Peter Teagan and invokes the name of Arthur D. Little Inc. to support his statement . </s>
<s> However , unlike Messrs. Graedel and Crutzen , who are both pioneers in the study of atmospheric chemistry , Mr. Teagan has no special expertise in the area . </s>
<s> He is a mechanical engineer , not an atmospheric chemist . </s>
<s> It is insulting and demeaning to say that scientists `` needed new crises to generate new grants and contracts '' and that environmental groups need them to stay in business . </s>
<s> Solving the global environmental problems we all face will require an unprecedented level of cooperation and communication among industry , policy makers and the scientific community world-wide . </s>
