<s> Federal and state thrift examiners said they saw evidence of criminal wrongdoing in the collapse of Lincoln Savings & Loan Association , and a California regulator described an attempted `` whitewash '' by deputies of chief federal regulator Danny Wall . </s>
<s> In a riveting day of hearings before the House Banking Committee , the examiners described finding shredded documents , a mysterious Panamanian subsidiary , millions of dollars funneled into a Swiss bank , and a complacent attitude by Mr. Wall 's deputies , one of whom was portrayed as acting more like a public-relations man for the thrift than a federal regulator . </s>
<s> A California official also said he sent the Federal Bureau of Investigation a packet of documents relating to a previously reported $ 400,000 contribution from Lincoln 's parent solicited by Sen. Alan Cranston -LRB- D. , Calif . -RRB- . </s>
<s> Federal examiner Alex Barabolak said Lincoln 's operations amounted to `` pyramiding debt to provide a luxurious life style for its owners . '' </s>
<s> Another federal examiner , John Meek , said Lincoln 's principal owner , Charles Keating Jr. , and his family drew off at least $ 34 million from the thrift in salaries , bonuses and proceeds from securities sales in the 3 1\/2 years before federal authorities seized it earlier this year . </s>
<s> Lincoln 's collapse may cost taxpayers as much as $ 2.5 billion , according to estimates , making it the most expensive thrift failure in history . </s>
<s> `` I think there 's overwhelming evidence to indicate probable criminal activity , '' said Mr. Meek , who participated last year in an examination of the Irvine , Calif. , thrift . </s>
<s> He said the evidence pointed to wrongdoing by Mr. Keating `` and others , '' although he did n't allege any specific violation . </s>
<s> Richard Newsom , a California state official who last year examined Lincoln 's parent , American Continental Corp. , said he also saw evidence that crimes had been committed . </s>
<s> `` It sure smells like it , '' he said . </s>
<s> He said 30 % of the loans he sampled were `` dead meat on the day they were made . '' </s>
<s> The state examiner also said supervisors of a parallel federal examination seemed so reluctant to demand write-downs of Lincoln 's bad loans that he immediately grew suspicious . </s>
<s> `` Later on , my concerns about a whitewash became even more serious , '' he said . </s>
<s> He called the sour loans `` appalling '' and added , `` You opened the file up and it just jumped at you . '' </s>
<s> Leonard Bickwit , a Washington attorney for Lincoln 's parent corporation , said in an interview , `` We deny any criminal behavior by the association or its officers . '' </s>
<s> `` Those who testified -LCB- yesterday -RCB- have consistently maintained that anyone who did n't agree with them is part of a coverup , a whitewash , or the subject of excessive influence , '' Mr. Bickwit said . </s>
<s> `` We simply do n't agree with that or the findings of their investigation . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Wall 's deputies complained that they had n't been given an opportunity to respond to the criticism brought out during the Banking Committee 's hearings , which Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez -LRB- D. , Texas -RRB- has used as a forum to flay Mr. Wall 's handling of the affair and to demand that he step aside from his job . </s>
<s> `` A couple of things Mr. Newsom said were at least misleading , '' said Kevin O'Connell , one of the Washington regulators responsible for the handling of Lincoln . </s>
<s> In an interview , he said federal regulators eventually declared one of the loans the state regulator cited to be a total loss , and forced Lincoln to make an $ 18 million downward adjustment on another . </s>
<s> `` Our response to the whitewash would simply be , look what happened , '' another Washington official , Alvin Smuzynski , said in an interview . </s>
<s> Federal officials seized the association in April , a day after the parent corporation entered bankruptcy-law proceedings . </s>
<s> The government later brought a $ 1.1 billion fraud suit against Mr. Keating and others . </s>
<s> Rep. Gonzalez has complained that regulators waited far too long , however , ignoring a recommendation from regional officials to place Lincoln into receivership two years before it failed . </s>
<s> `` He took the reckless course of ignoring the evidence , '' Rep. Gonzalez said . </s>
<s> State thrift examiner Eugene Stelzer said he found the chief federal examiner Steve Scott to be totally uninterested in one allegedly fraudulent series of transactions . </s>
<s> `` Frankly , it was like he worked for the Lincoln public-relations department , '' Mr. Stelzer testified . </s>
<s> And David Riley , a federal examiner who worked under Mr. Scott , said he found his chief oddly upbeat about Lincoln . </s>
<s> Asked to comment , a spokesman for Mr. Scott said : `` Mr. Scott has spoken to his attorney , who has advised him not to talk to anybody . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Meek said that a day or two before Lincoln 's parent entered bankruptcy proceedings , he and other examiners saw `` a truck with a sign on it that said it was from the ` Document Destruction Center . ' </s>
<s> We observed at least two large plastic bags of shredded paper loaded into this truck . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Bickwit said the paper had been donated to `` a charitable organization that sells it for recycling . </s>
<s> They shredded it simply because it contained financial information about their creditors and depositors . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Meek said his suspicions were aroused by several foreign investments by Lincoln , including $ 22 million paid to Credit Suisse of Switzerland , an $ 18 million interest in Saudi European Bank in Paris , a $ 17.5 million investment in a Bahamas trading company , and a recently discovered holding in a Panama-based company , Southbrook Holdings . </s>
<s> Mr. Bickwit said , `` I can see why an S&L examiner would regard these as unusual activities , '' but said the overseas investments `` essentially broke even '' for the S&L . </s>
