<s> When U.S. trading began , Treasury bonds received an additional boost from news that sales of new single-family homes fell 14 % in September . </s>
<s> The contraction was twice as large as economists projected and was the sharpest decline since a 19 % drop in January 1982 . </s>
<s> Economists said the report raised speculation that the economic slowdown could turn into a recession , which would pave the way for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates . </s>
<s> But later in the day , a report by the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago cast doubt on the recession scenario . </s>
<s> The association said its October index of economic activity rose to 51.6 % after having been below 50 % for three consecutive months . </s>
<s> A reading below 50 % indicates that the manufacturing industry is slowing while a reading above 50 % suggests that the industry is expanding . </s>
<s> Bond prices fell after the Chicago report was released . </s>

<s> In October 1979 , just days before the Federal Reserve raised interest rates , IBM offered $ 1 billion in debt securities . </s>

<s> There 's light at the end of the tunnel for municipals , '' he said , adding that he expects prices to `` inch up '' in the near term . </s>
<s> The market 's tone improved after Monday 's pricing of $ 813 million New York City general obligation bonds . </s>
<s> The issue 's smooth absorption eased fears that supply would overwhelm demand in coming sessions , traders said . </s>
<s> Demand for the bonds was strong enough to permit underwriters to trim some yields in the tax-exempt portion of the offering late Monday . </s>
<s> A two-part $ 75.1 million offering of wastewater treatment bonds by the New Jersey Wastewater Treatment Trust was more than half sold by late in the session , according to lead underwriter Merrill Lynch Capital Markets . </s>
