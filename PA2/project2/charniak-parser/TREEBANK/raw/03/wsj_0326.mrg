<s> Philip Morris Cos. is launching a massive corporate advertising campaign that will put the tobacco giant 's name in TV commercials for the first time since the early 1950s , when it stopped advertising its namesake cigarette brand on television . </s>
<s> The campaign , a patriotic celebration of the 200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights , does n't mention cigarettes or smoking ; cigarette ads have been prohibited on television since 1971 . </s>
<s> But even before it begins , the campaign is drawing fire from anti-smoking advocates , who criticize Philip Morris 's attempt to bolster its beleaguered image by wrapping itself in the document that is a cornerstone of American democracy . </s>
<s> Philip Morris , which became the U.S. 's largest food company last year with its $ 12.9 billion acquisition of Kraft Inc. , seems determined to evolve beyond its roots in Marlboro country . </s>
<s> The company 's research suggests that its name recognition among most consumers remains unusually low , although its array of brands -- including Maxwell House coffee , Jell-O , Cheez Whiz , and Miller beer -- blanket supermarket shelves . </s>
<s> The company is expected to spend about $ 30 million a year on its two-year corporate campaign , created by WPP Group 's Ogilvy & Mather unit in New York . </s>
<s> The initial spots will appear during morning and prime-time news shows . </s>
<s> Philip Morris hopes that by taking its Bill of Rights theme to the airwaves , in addition to publications , it will reach the broadest possible audience . </s>
<s> Until now , its corporate ads , mainly promoting its sponsorship of the arts , have appeared almost exclusively in newspapers and magazines . </s>
<s> `` Most people -- whether in Toledo , Tucson or Topeka -- have n't got a clue who we are , '' says Guy L. Smith , Philip Morris 's vice president of corporate affairs . </s>
<s> `` If they think well of the company through our support of the Bill of Rights , it follows they 'll think well of our products . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Smith says the Bill of Rights commercial , which trumpets the themes of liberty and freedom of expression , is n't designed to have any special appeal for smokers . </s>
<s> Although Philip Morris typically tries to defend the rights of smokers with free-choice arguments , `` this has nothing to do with cigarettes , nor will it ever , '' the spokesman says . </s>
<s> But some anti-smoking activists disagree , expressing anger at what they see as the company 's attempt to purchase innocence by association . </s>
<s> `` I 'm outraged because this company is portraying itself at the heart of American culture and political freedom and in fact it 's a killer , '' says Michael Pertschuk , former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission and a tobacco-industry critic . </s>
<s> `` It should be treated like the Medellin -LCB- drug -RCB- mafia , not the Founding Fathers . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Pertschuk adds that the new commercial dovetails perfectly with major aspects of Philip Morris 's political strategy . </s>
<s> These include trying to protect its print advertising by invoking the First Amendment , and wooing blacks by portraying itself as a protector of civil rights . </s>
<s> -LRB- The commercial features , among others , the voice of Martin Luther King Jr. , the slain civil rights leader . -RRB- </s>
<s> Many marketers say Philip Morris 's approach will be effective , but they agree that the ads ' implied smoking message is unmistakable . </s>
<s> `` This is clever , subliminal advertising that really says , ` Smokers have rights , too , ' '' says Al Ries , chairman of Trout & Ries Inc. , a Greenwich , Conn. , marketing strategy firm . </s>
<s> `` This is designed to get the wagons in a circle and defend the smoking franchise . '' </s>
<s> Richard Winger , a partner at Boston Consulting Group , adds : `` It 's very popular to drape yourself in the flag these days . </s>
<s> If you can do that and at the same time send a message that supports your business , that 's brilliant . '' </s>
<s> RJR Nabisco Inc. and American Brands Inc. say they have no plans to follow Philip Morris 's lead . </s>
<s> -LRB- Indeed , RJR Nabisco is currently under fire for having sent 80-second videotapes touting its Now brand to consumers who smoke American Brands ' Carltons . -RRB- </s>
<s> Despite the criticism , Philip Morris 's corporate campaign runs little risk of getting yanked off the tube . </s>
<s> `` They are n't showing James Madison taking a puff or lighting up , '' says Laurence Tribe , a professor of constitutional law at Harvard University . </s>
<s> `` All they are trying to do is borrow some of the legitimacy of the Bill of Rights itself . </s>
