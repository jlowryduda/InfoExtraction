<s> You 'd think all the stories about well-heeled communities and developers getting HUD grants would prompt Congress to tighten up on upscale housing subsidies . </s>
<s> No way . </s>
<s> Congress has just made it easier for the affluent to qualify for insured loans from the deficit-ridden Federal Housing Administration . </s>
<s> It appears that the only thing Congress is learning from the HUD story is how to enlarge its control of the honey pot going to special interests . </s>
<s> Right now , the largest loan the FHA can insure in high-cost housing markets is $ 101,250 . </s>
<s> Last week , housing lobbies persuaded Congress to raise the ceiling to $ 124,875 , making FHA loans more accessible to the well-to-do . </s>
<s> But it does that at the cost of deepening the taxpayer 's exposure if the FHA is forced to pay for more loans going sour . </s>
<s> This is no idle fear last year the FHA lost $ 4.2 billion in loan defaults . </s>
<s> But the higher mortgage ceiling is only the starter kit for what Senator Alan Cranston and Majority Leader George Mitchell have in mind for housing . </s>
<s> The Senate Banking Committee will begin hearings next week on their proposal to expand existing federal housing programs . </s>
<s> Other Senators want to lower the down payments required on FHA-insured loans . </s>
<s> That would be a formula for ensuring even more FHA red ink . </s>
<s> Experience has shown that the most important element in predicting a housing-loan default is the down payment . </s>
<s> Because a purchaser can use an FHA loan to finance all points and closing costs , the FHA can wind up lending more than a house is worth . </s>
<s> If housing prices continue to fall , many borrowers would be better off walking away from their homes and leaving taxpayers with the losses . </s>
<s> Much the same thing happened with busted S&Ls , a problem Congress just `` solved '' with a $ 166 billion bailout . </s>
<s> We hear that HUD Secretary Jack Kemp is toying with going along with some of the Cranston-Mitchell proposals . </s>
<s> That sounds like a formula for ensuring that he gets dragged into the next HUD tar pit . </s>
<s> A group of 27 Senators has written Mr. Kemp urging him to reject Cranston-Mitchell and focus on programs that empower the poor rather than create vast new government obligations . </s>
<s> But even if he agrees , Mr. Kemp does n't write the nation 's housing law -- Congress does . </s>
<s> And the majority of Members cynically view the current discrediting of HUD as mainly a chance to shove through their own slate of projects . </s>
<s> Exhibit A is last week 's House vote to fund 40 pet projects out of the same discretionary fund that is at the heart of the HUD scandal . </s>
<s> None of the grants had been requested by HUD , judged competitively or were the subject of a single hearing . </s>
<s> More and more observers now realize that the key to ending future HUD scandals lies in forcing Congress to clean up its own act . </s>
<s> This week , a Baltimore Sun editorial said the Lantos subcommittee on HUD should forget about Sam Pierce 's testimony for the moment and call some other witnesses : the various congressional sponsors of the 40 pork-barrel projects . </s>
<s> The Sun concluded that Mr. Pierce is only part of the problem -- and a part that 's gone . </s>
<s> `` If HUD is to be reformed , '' it concluded , Members of Congress will `` have to start looking into , and doing something about , the practices of their colleagues . '' </s>
<s> Of course , self-reform is about the last thing this Congress is interested in . </s>
<s> Proponents of expanding FHA programs say they merely want to help home buyers who are frozen out of high-priced markets . </s>
<s> But the FHA program is hemorrhaging bad loans . </s>
<s> Jack Kemp has submitted a package of reforms , and they are surely headed for the Capitol Hill sausage-grinder . </s>
<s> Like the S&L mess before it , this is a problem Congress should be solving , not ignoring . </s>
