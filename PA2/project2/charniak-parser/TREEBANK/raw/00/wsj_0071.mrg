<s> When Warren Winiarski , proprietor of Stag 's Leap Wine Cellars in Napa Valley , announced a $ 75 price tag for his 1985 Cask 23 Cabernet this fall , few wine shops and restaurants around the country balked . </s>
<s> `` This is the peak of my wine-making experience , '' Mr. Winiarski declared when he introduced the wine at a dinner in New York , `` and I wanted to single it out as such . '' </s>
<s> It is in my estimation the best wine Stag 's Leap has produced , and with fewer than 700 cases available , it is sure to sell quickly . </s>
<s> The price is a new high for California Cabernet Sauvignon , but it is not the highest . </s>
<s> Diamond Creek 1985 Lake Vineyard Cabernet weighed in this fall with a sticker price of $ 100 a bottle . </s>
<s> One of the fastest growing segments of the wine market is the category of superpremiums -- wines limited in production , of exceptional quality -LRB- or so perceived , at any rate -RRB- , and with exceedingly high prices . </s>
<s> For years , this group included a stable of classics -- Bordeaux first growths -LRB- Lafite-Rothschild , Latour , Haut-Brion , Petrus -RRB- , Grand Cru Burgundies -LRB- Romanee-Conti and La Tache -RRB- deluxe Champagnes -LRB- Dom Perignon or Roederer Cristal -RRB- , rarefied sweet wines -LRB- Chateau Yquem or Trockenbeerenauslesen Rieslings from Germany , and Biondi-Santi Brunello Riserva from Tuscany -RRB- . </s>
<s> These first magnitude wines ranged in price from $ 40 to $ 125 a bottle . </s>
<s> In the last year or so , however , this exclusive club has taken in a host of flashy new members . </s>
<s> The classics have zoomed in price to meet the competition , and it almost seems that there 's a race on to come up with the priciest single bottle , among current releases from every major wine region on the globe . </s>
<s> France can boast the lion 's share of high-priced bottles . </s>
<s> Bordeaux 's first growths from 1985 and 1986 are $ 60 to $ 80 each -LRB- except for the smallest in terms of production , Chateau Petrus , which costs around $ 250 ! -RRB- . </s>
<s> These prices seem rather modest , however , in light of other French wines from current vintages . </s>
<s> Chateau Yquem , the leading Sauternes , now goes for well over $ 100 a bottle for a lighter vintage like 1984 ; the spectacularly rich 1983 runs $ 179 . </s>
<s> In Champagne , some of the prestige cuvees are inching toward $ 100 a bottle . </s>
<s> The first Champagne to crack that price barrier was the 1979 Salon de Mesnil Blanc de Blancs . </s>
<s> The '82 Salon is $ 115 . </s>
<s> Roederer Cristal at $ 90 a bottle sells out around the country and Taittinger 's Comtes de Champagne Blanc de Blancs is encroaching upon that level . </s>
<s> The great reds of the Rhone Valley have soared in price as well . </s>
<s> E. Guigal 's 1982 Cote Rotie La Landonne , for example , is $ 120 . </s>
<s> None of France 's wine regions can steal a march on Burgundy , however . </s>
<s> The six wines of the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti , 72 of the most precious acres of vineyard anywhere in the world , have commanded three-digit price tags for several years now . </s>
<s> With the 1985 vintage , they soared higher : La Tache , $ 195 ; Richebourg , $ 180 ; Romanee-Conti , $ 225 . </s>
<s> Another small Burgundy estate , Coche-Dury , has just offered its 1987 Corton-Charlemagne for $ 155 . </s>
<s> From Italy there is Angelo Gaja Barbaresco at $ 125 a bottle , Piero Antinori 's La Solaia , a $ 90 Cabernet from Tuscany , and Biondi-Santi Brunello at $ 98 . </s>
<s> Spain 's Vega Secilia Unico 1979 -LRB- released only in its 10th year -RRB- is $ 70 , as is Australia 's Grange Hermitage 1982 . </s>
<s> `` There are certain cult wines that can command these higher prices , '' says Larry Shapiro of Marty 's , one of the largest wine shops in Dallas . </s>
<s> `` What 's different is that it is happening with young wines just coming out . </s>
<s> We 're seeing it partly because older vintages are growing more scarce . '' </s>
<s> Wine auctions have almost exhausted the limited supply of those wines , Mr. Shapiro continued : `` We 've seen a dramatic decrease in demand for wines from the '40s and '50s , which go for $ 300 to $ 400 a bottle . </s>
<s> Some of the newer wines , even at $ 90 to $ 100 a bottle or so , almost offer a bargain . '' </s>
<s> Take Lake Vineyard Cabernet from Diamond Creek . </s>
<s> It 's made only in years when the grapes ripen perfectly -LRB- the last was 1979 -RRB- and comes from a single acre of grapes that yielded a mere 75 cases in 1987 . </s>
<s> Owner Al Brownstein originally planned to sell it for $ 60 a bottle , but when a retailer in Southern California asked , `` Is that wholesale or retail ? '' he re-thought the matter . </s>
<s> Offering the wine at roughly $ 65 a bottle wholesale -LRB- $ 100 retail -RRB- , he sent merchants around the country a form asking them to check one of three answers : 1 -RRB- no , the wine is too high -LRB- 2 responses -RRB- ; 2 -RRB- yes , it 's high but I 'll take it -LRB- 2 responses -RRB- ; 3 -RRB- I 'll take all I can get -LRB- 58 responses -RRB- . </s>
<s> The wine was shipped in six-bottle cases instead of the usual 12 , but even at that it was spread thin , going to 62 retailers in 28 states . </s>
<s> `` We thought it was awfully expensive , '' said Sterling Pratt , wine director at Schaefer 's in Skokie , Ill. , one of the top stores in suburban Chicago , `` but there are people out there with very different opinions of value . </s>
<s> We got our two six-packs -- and they 're gone . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Pratt remarked that he thinks steeper prices have come about because producers do n't like to see a hit wine dramatically increase in price later on . </s>
<s> Even if there is consumer resistance at first , a wine that wins high ratings from the critics will eventually move . </s>
<s> `` There may be sticker-shock reaction initially , '' said Mr. Pratt , `` but as the wine is talked about and starts to sell , they eventually get excited and decide it 's worth the astronomical price to add it to their collection . '' </s>
<s> `` It 's just sort of a one-upsmanship thing with some people , '' added Larry Shapiro . </s>
<s> `` They like to talk about having the new Red Rock Terrace -LCB- one of Diamond Creek 's Cabernets -RCB- or the Dunn 1985 Cabernet , or the Petrus . </s>
<s> Producers have seen this market opening up and they 're now creating wines that appeal to these people . '' </s>
<s> That explains why the number of these wines is expanding so rapidly . </s>
<s> But consumers who buy at this level are also more knowledgeable than they were a few years ago . </s>
<s> `` They wo n't buy if the quality is not there , '' said Cedric Martin of Martin Wine Cellar in New Orleans . </s>
<s> `` Or if they feel the wine is overpriced and they can get something equally good for less . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Martin has increased prices on some wines -LRB- like Grgich Hills Chardonnay , now $ 32 -RRB- just to slow down movement , but he is beginning to see some resistance to high-priced red Burgundies and Cabernets and Chardonnays in the $ 30 to $ 40 range . </s>
<s> Image has , of course , a great deal to do with what sells and what does n't , and it ca n't be forced . </s>
<s> Wine merchants ca n't keep Roederer Cristal in stock , but they have to push Salon le Mesnil , even lowering the price from $ 115 to $ 90 . </s>
<s> It 's hardly a question of quality -- the 1982 Salon is a beautiful wine , but , as Mr. Pratt noted , people have their own ideas about value . </s>
<s> It 's interesting to find that a lot of the expensive wines are n't always walking out the door . </s>
<s> In every major market in the U.S. , for instance , you can buy '86 La Tache or Richebourg , virtually all of the first growth Bordeaux -LRB- except Petrus -RRB- , as well as Opus One and Dominus from California and , at the moment , the Stag 's Leap 1985 Cask 23 . </s>
<s> With the biggest wine-buying period of the year looming as the holidays approach , it will be interesting to see how the superpremiums fare . </s>
<s> By January it should be fairly clear what 's hot -- and what 's not . </s>
