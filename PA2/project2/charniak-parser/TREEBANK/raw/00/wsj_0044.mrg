<s> Cathryn Rice could hardly believe her eyes . </s>
<s> While giving the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills to ninth graders at Greenville High School last March 16 , she spotted a student looking at crib sheets . </s>
<s> She had seen cheating before , but these notes were uncanny . </s>
<s> `` A stockbroker is an example of a profession in trade and finance ... . </s>
<s> At the end of World War II , Germany surrendered before Japan ... . </s>
<s> The Senate-House conference committee is used when a bill is passed by the House and Senate in different forms . '' </s>
<s> Virtually word for word , the notes matched questions and answers on the social-studies section of the test the student was taking . </s>
<s> In fact , the student had the answers to almost all of the 40 questions in that section . </s>
<s> The student surrendered the notes , but not without a protest . </s>
<s> `` My teacher said it was OK for me to use the notes on the test , '' he said . </s>
<s> The teacher in question was Nancy Yeargin -- considered by many students and parents to be one of the best at the school . </s>
<s> Confronted , Mrs. Yeargin admitted she had given the questions and answers two days before the examination to two low-ability geography classes . </s>
<s> She had gone so far as to display the questions on an overhead projector and underline the answers . </s>
<s> Mrs. Yeargin was fired and prosecuted under an unusual South Carolina law that makes it a crime to breach test security . </s>
<s> In September , she pleaded guilty and paid a $ 500 fine . </s>
<s> Her alternative was 90 days in jail . </s>
<s> Her story is partly one of personal downfall . </s>
<s> She was an unstinting teacher who won laurels and inspired students , but she will probably never teach again . </s>
<s> In her wake she left the bitterness and anger of a principal who was her friend and now calls her a betrayer ; of colleagues who say she brought them shame ; of students and parents who defended her and insist she was treated harshly ; and of school-district officials stunned that despite the bald-faced nature of her actions , she became something of a local martyr . </s>
<s> Mrs. Yeargin 's case also casts some light on the dark side of school reform , where pressures on teachers are growing and where high-stakes testing has enhanced the temptation to cheat . </s>
<s> The 1987 statute Mrs. Yeargin violated was designed to enforce provisions of South Carolina 's school-improvement laws . </s>
<s> Prosecutors alleged that she was trying to bolster students ' scores to win a bonus under the state 's 1984 Education Improvement Act . </s>
<s> The bonus depended on her ability to produce higher student-test scores . </s>
<s> `` There is incredible pressure on school systems and teachers to raise test scores , '' says Walt Haney , an education professor and testing specialist at Boston College . </s>
<s> `` So efforts to beat the tests are also on the rise . '' </s>
<s> And most disturbing , it is educators , not students , who are blamed for much of the wrongdoing . </s>
<s> A 50-state study released in September by Friends for Education , an Albuquerque , N.M. , school-research group , concluded that `` outright cheating by American educators '' is `` common . '' </s>
<s> The group says standardized achievement test scores are greatly inflated because teachers often `` teach the test '' as Mrs. Yeargin did , although most are never caught . </s>
<s> Evidence of widespread cheating has surfaced in several states in the last year or so . </s>
<s> California 's education department suspects adult responsibility for erasures at 40 schools that changed wrong answers to right ones on a statewide test . </s>
<s> After numerous occurrences of questionable teacher help to students , Texas is revising its security practices . </s>
<s> And sales of test-coaching booklets for classroom instruction are booming . </s>
<s> These materials , including Macmillan\/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Co. 's Scoring High and Learning Materials -- are nothing short of sophisticated crib sheets , according to some recent academic research . </s>
<s> By using them , teachers -- with administrative blessing -- telegraph to students beforehand the precise areas on which a test will concentrate , and sometimes give away a few exact questions and answers . </s>
<s> Use of Scoring High is widespread in South Carolina and common in Greenville County , Mrs. Yeargin 's school district . </s>
<s> Experts say there is n't another state in the country where tests mean as much as they do in South Carolina . </s>
<s> Under the state 's Education Improvement Act , low test scores can block students ' promotions or force entire districts into wrenching , state-supervised `` interventions '' that can mean firings . </s>
<s> High test scores , on the other hand , bring recognition and extra money -- a new computer lab for a school , grants for special projects , a bonus for the superintendent . </s>
<s> And South Carolina says it is getting results . </s>
<s> Since the reforms went in place , for example , no state has posted a higher rate of improvement on the Scholastic Aptitude Test than South Carolina , although the state still posts the lowest average score of the about 21 states who use the SAT as the primary college entrance examination . </s>
<s> Critics say South Carolina is paying a price by stressing improved test scores so much . </s>
<s> Friends of Education rates South Carolina one of the worst seven states in its study on academic cheating . </s>
<s> Says the organization 's founder , John Cannell , prosecuting Mrs. Yeargin is `` a way for administrators to protect themselves and look like they take cheating seriously , when in fact they do n't take it seriously at all . '' </s>
<s> Paul Sandifer , director of testing for the South Carolina department of education , says Mr. Cannell 's allegations of cheating `` are purely without foundation , '' and based on unfair inferences . </s>
<s> Partly because of worries about potential abuse , however , he says the state will begin keeping closer track of achievement-test preparation booklets next spring . </s>
<s> South Carolina 's reforms were designed for schools like Greenville High School . </s>
<s> Standing on a shaded hill in a run-down area of this old textile city , the school has educated many of South Carolina 's best and brightest , including the state 's last two governors , Nobel Prize winning physicist Charles Townes and actress Joanne Woodward . </s>
<s> But by the early 1980s , its glory had faded like the yellow bricks of its broad facade . </s>
<s> `` It was full of violence and gangs and kids cutting class , '' says Linda Ward , the school 's principal . </s>
<s> `` Crime was awful , test scores were low , and there was no enrollment in honors programs . '' </s>
<s> Mrs. Ward took over in 1986 , becoming the school 's seventh principal in 15 years . </s>
<s> Her immediate predecessor suffered a nervous breakdown . </s>
<s> Prior to his term , a teacher bled to death in the halls , stabbed by a student . </s>
<s> Academically , Mrs. Ward says , the school was having trouble serving in harmony its two disparate , and evenly split , student groups : a privileged white elite from old monied neighborhoods and blacks , many of them poor , from run-down , inner city neighborhoods . </s>
<s> Mrs. Ward resolved to clean out `` deadwood '' in the school 's faculty and restore safety , and she also had some new factors working in her behalf . </s>
<s> One was statewide school reform , which raised overall educational funding and ushered in a new public spirit for school betterment . </s>
<s> Another was Nancy Yeargin , who came to Greenville in 1985 , full of the energy and ambitions that reformers wanted to reward . </s>
<s> `` Being a teacher just became my life , '' says the 37-year-old Mrs. Yeargin , a teacher for 12 years before her dismissal . `` </s>
<s> I loved the school , its history . </s>
<s> I even dreamt about school and new things to do with my students . '' </s>
<s> While Mrs. Ward fired and restructured staff and struggled to improve curriculum , Mrs. Yeargin worked 14-hour days and fast became a student favorite . </s>
<s> In 1986-87 and 1987-88 , she applied for and won bonus pay under the reform law . </s>
<s> Encouraged by Mrs. Ward , Mrs. Yeargin taught honor students in the state `` teacher cadet '' program , a reform creation designed to encourage good students to consider teaching as a career . </s>
<s> She won grant money for the school , advised cheerleaders , ran the pep club , proposed and taught a new `` Cultural Literacy '' class in Western Civilization and was chosen by the school PTA as `` Teacher of the Year . '' </s>
<s> `` She was an inspirational lady ; she had it all together , '' says Laura Dobson , a freshman at the University of South Carolina who had Mrs. Yeargin in the teacher-cadet class last year . </s>
<s> She says that because of Mrs. Yeargin she gave up ambitions in architecture and is studying to become a teacher . </s>
<s> Mary Beth Marchand , a Greenville 11th grader , also says Mrs. Yeargin inspired her to go into education . </s>
<s> `` She taught us more in Western Civilization than I 've ever learned in other classes , '' says Kelli Green , a Greenville senior . </s>
<s> In the classroom , students say , Mrs. Yeargin distinguished herself by varying teaching approaches -- forcing kids to pair up to complete classroom work or using college-bowl type competitions . </s>
<s> On weekends , she came to work to prepare study plans or sometimes , even to polish the furniture in her classroom . </s>
<s> `` She just never gave it up , '' says Mary Marchand , Mary Beth 's mother . </s>
<s> `` You 'd see her correcting homework in the stands at a football game . '' </s>
<s> Some fellow teachers , however , viewed Mrs. Yeargin as cocky and too yielding to students . </s>
<s> Mrs. Ward says she often defended her to colleagues who called her a grandstander . </s>
<s> Pressures began to build . </s>
<s> Friends told her she was pushing too hard . </s>
<s> Because of deteriorating hearing , she told colleagues she feared she might not be able to teach much longer . </s>
<s> Mrs. Yeargin 's extra work was also helping her earn points in the state 's incentive-bonus program . </s>
<s> But the most important source of points was student improvement on tests . </s>
<s> Huge gains by her students in 1987 and 1988 meant a total of $ 5,000 in bonuses over two years -- a meaningful addition to her annual salary of $ 23,000 . </s>
<s> Winning a bonus for a third year was n't that important to her , Mrs. Yeargin insists . </s>
<s> But others at Greenville High say she was eager to win -- if not for money , then for pride and recognition . </s>
<s> Mary Elizabeth Ariail , another social-studies teacher , says she believed Mrs. Yeargin wanted to keep her standing high so she could get a new job that would n't demand good hearing . </s>
<s> Indeed , Mrs. Yeargin was interested in a possible job with the state teacher cadet program . </s>
<s> Last March , after attending a teaching seminar in Washington , Mrs. Yeargin says she returned to Greenville two days before annual testing feeling that she had n't prepared her low-ability geography students adequately . </s>
<s> When test booklets were passed out 48 hours ahead of time , she says she copied questions in the social studies section and gave the answers to students . </s>
<s> Mrs. Yeargin admits she made a big mistake but insists her motives were correct . </s>
<s> `` I was trying to help kids in an unfair testing situation , '' she says . </s>
<s> `` Only five of the 40 questions were geography questions . </s>
<s> The rest were history , sociology , finance -- subjects they never had . '' </s>
<s> Mrs. Yeargin says that she also wanted to help lift Greenville High School 's overall test scores , usually near the bottom of 14 district high schools in rankings carried annually by local newspapers . </s>
<s> Mostly , she says , she wanted to prevent the damage to self-esteem that her low-ability students would suffer from doing badly on the test . </s>
<s> `` These kids broke my heart , '' she says . </s>
<s> `` A whole day goes by and no one even knows they 're alive . </s>
<s> They desperately needed somebody who showed they cared for them , who loved them . </s>
<s> The last thing they needed was another drag-down blow . '' </s>
<s> School officials and prosecutors say Mrs. Yeargin is lying . </s>
<s> They found students in an advanced class a year earlier who said she gave them similar help , although because the case was n't tried in court , this evidence was never presented publicly . </s>
<s> `` That pretty much defeats any inkling that she was out to help the poor underprivileged child , '' says Joe Watson , the prosecutor in the case , who is also president of Greenville High School 's alumni association . </s>
<s> Mrs. Yeargin concedes that she went over the questions in the earlier class , adding : `` I wanted to help all '' students . </s>
<s> Mr. Watson says Mrs. Yeargin never complained to school officials that the standardized test was unfair . </s>
<s> `` Do I have much sympathy for her ? '' Mr. Watson asks . </s>
<s> `` Not really . </s>
<s> I believe in the system . </s>
<s> I believe you have to use the system to change it . </s>
<s> What she did was like taking the law into your own hands . '' </s>
<s> Mrs. Ward says that when the cheating was discovered , she wanted to avoid the morale-damaging public disclosure that a trial would bring . </s>
<s> She says she offered Mrs. Yeargin a quiet resignation and thought she could help save her teaching certificate . </s>
<s> Mrs. Yeargin declined . </s>
<s> `` She said something like ` You just want to make it easy for the school . ' </s>
<s> I was dumbfounded , '' Mrs. Ward recalls . </s>
<s> `` It was like someone had turned a knife in me . '' </s>
<s> To the astonishment and dismay of her superiors and legal authorities -- and perhaps as a measure of the unpopularity of standardized tests -- Mrs . Yeargin won widespread local support . </s>
<s> The school-board hearing at which she was dismissed was crowded with students , teachers and parents who came to testify on her behalf . </s>
<s> Supportive callers decried unfair testing , not Mrs. Yeargin , on a local radio talk show on which she appeared . </s>
<s> The show did n't give the particulars of Mrs. Yeargin 's offense , saying only that she helped students do better on the test . </s>
<s> `` The message to the board of education out of all this is we 've got to take a serious look at how we 're doing our curriculum and our testing policies in this state , '' said the talk-show host . </s>
<s> Editorials in the Greenville newspaper allowed that Mrs. Yeargin was wrong , but also said the case showed how testing was being overused . </s>
<s> The radio show `` enraged us , '' says Mrs. Ward . </s>
<s> Partly because of the show , Mr. Watson says , the district decided not to recommend Mrs. Yeargin for a first-time offenders program that could have expunged the charges and the conviction from her record . </s>
<s> And legal authorities cranked up an investigation worthy of a murder case . </s>
<s> Over 50 witnesses , mostly students , were interviewed . </s>
<s> At Greenville High School , meanwhile , some students -- especially on the cheerleading squad -- were crushed . </s>
<s> `` It 's hard to explain to a 17-year-old why someone they like had to go , '' says Mrs. Ward . </s>
<s> Soon , T-shirts appeared in the corridors that carried the school 's familiar red-and-white GHS logo on the front . </s>
<s> On the back , the shirts read , `` We have all the answers . '' </s>
<s> Many colleagues are angry at Mrs. Yeargin . </s>
<s> `` She did a lot of harm , '' says Cathryn Rice , who had discovered the crib notes . </s>
<s> `` We work damn hard at what we do for damn little pay , and what she did cast unfair aspersions on all of us . '' </s>
<s> But several teachers also say the incident casts doubt on the wisdom of evaluating teachers or schools by using standardized test scores . </s>
<s> Says Gayle Key , a mathematics teacher , `` The incentive pay thing has opened up a can of worms . </s>
<s> There may be others doing what she did . '' </s>
<s> Mrs. Yeargin says she pleaded guilty because she realized it would no longer be possible to win reinstatement , and because she was afraid of further charges . </s>
<s> Mrs. Ward , for one , was relieved . </s>
<s> Despite the strong evidence against Mrs. Yeargin , popular sentiment was so strong in her favor , Mrs. Ward says , that `` I 'm afraid a jury would n't have convicted her . </s>
