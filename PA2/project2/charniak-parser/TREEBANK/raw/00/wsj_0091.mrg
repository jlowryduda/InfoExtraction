<s> Your Oct. 13 page-one story on the renewed plight of Western Union says that Western Union had lost its chance to be in the telephone business by turning down Alexander Graham Bell 's offer to it of his invention , because it supposedly felt that voice communication would never replace the telegraph . </s>

<s> When Bell established that the Berliner patent caveat was registered 10 days before Edison 's application , Western Union dropped the lawsuit and agreed never to enter the telephone business -- the basis for the company 's current plight . </s>
