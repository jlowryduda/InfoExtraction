<s> In this era of frantic competition for ad dollars , a lot of revenue-desperate magazines are getting pretty cozy with advertisers -- fawning over them in articles and offering pages of advertorial space . </s>
<s> So can a magazine survive by downright thumbing its nose at major advertisers ? </s>
<s> Garbage magazine , billed as `` The Practical Journal for the Environment , '' is about to find out . </s>
<s> Founded by Brooklyn , N.Y. , publishing entrepreneur Patricia Poore , Garbage made its debut this fall with the promise to give consumers the straight scoop on the U.S. waste crisis . </s>
<s> The magazine combines how-to pieces on topics like backyard composting , explanatory essays on such things as what happens after you flush your toilet , and hard-hitting pieces on alleged environmental offenders . </s>
<s> Garbage editors have dumped considerable energy into a whirling rampage through supermarket aisles in a bid to identify corporate America 's good guys and bad boys . </s>
<s> In one feature , called `` In the Dumpster , '' editors point out a product they deem to be a particularly bad offender . </s>
<s> From an advertising standpoint , the problem is these offenders are likely to be some of the same folks that are major magazine advertisers these days . </s>
<s> With only two issues under its belt , Garbage has alienated some would-be advertisers and raised the ire of others . </s>
<s> Campbell Soup , for one , is furious its Souper Combo microwave product was chastised in the premiere `` In the Dumpster '' column . </s>
<s> The magazine 's editors ran a giant diagram of the product with arrows pointing to the packaging 's polystyrene foam , polyproplene and polyester film -- all plastic items they say are non-biodegradable . </s>
<s> `` It 's precisely the kind of product that 's created the municipal landfill monster , '' the editors wrote . </s>
<s> `` I think that this magazine is not only called Garbage , but it is practicing journalistic garbage , '' fumes a spokesman for Campbell Soup . </s>
<s> He says Campbell was n't even contacted by the magazine for the opportunity to comment . </s>
<s> Modifications had been made to the Souper Combo product at the time the issue was printed , he says , making it less an offender than was portrayed . </s>
<s> He admits , though , it is n't one of Campbell Soup 's better products in terms of recyclability . </s>
<s> Campbell Soup , not surprisingly , does n't have any plans to advertise in the magazine , according to its spokesman . </s>
<s> Some media experts question whether a young magazine can risk turning off Madison Avenue 's big spenders . </s>
<s> `` You really need the Campbell Soups of the world to be interested in your magazine if you 're going to make a run of it , '' says Mike White , senior vice president and media director at DDB Needham , Chicago . </s>
<s> `` The economics of magazine publishing pretty much require that you have a pretty solid base '' of big-time ad spenders , he adds . </s>
<s> The first two issues featured ads from only a handful of big advertisers , including General Electric and Adolph Coors , but the majority were from companies like Waste Management Inc. and Bumkins International , firms that do n't spend much money advertising and ca n't be relied on to support a magazine over the long haul . </s>
<s> A Waste Management spokeswoman says its ad in the premiere issue was a one-time purchase , and it does n't have any plans to advertise in future issues . </s>
<s> `` We do n't spend much on print advertising , '' she says . </s>
<s> But Ms. Poore , the magazine 's editor and publisher , contends Garbage can survive , at least initially , on subscription revenues . </s>
<s> Individual copies of the magazine sell for $ 2.95 and yearly subscriptions cost $ 21 . </s>
<s> -LRB- It is , of course , printed on recycled paper . -RRB- </s>
<s> According to Ms. Poore , Old-House Journal Corp. , her publishing company , printed and sold all 126,000 copies of the premiere issue . </s>
<s> The first and second issues sold out on newsstands , she says , and the magazine has orders for 93,000 subscriptions . </s>
<s> Asked whether potential advertisers will be scared away by the magazine 's direct policy , Ms. Poore replies : `` I do n't know and I do n't care . </s>
<s> I 'm not saying advertising revenue is n't important , '' she says , `` but I could n't sleep at night '' if the magazine bowed to a company because they once took out an ad . </s>
