<s> This is the year the negative ad , for years a secondary presence in most political campaigns , became the main event . </s>
<s> The irony is that the attack commercial , after getting a boost in last year 's presidential campaign , has come of age in an off-off election year with only a few contests scattered across the country . </s>
<s> But in the three leading political contests of 1989 , the negative ads have reached new levels of hostility , raising fears that this kind of mudslinging , empty of significant issues , is ushering in a new era of campaigns without content . </s>
<s> `` Now , '' says Joseph Napolitan , a pioneer in political television , `` the idea is to attack first , last and always . '' </s>
<s> A trend that started with the first stirrings of politics , accelerated with the dawn of the television age and became a sometimes-tawdry art form in 1988 , has reached an entirely new stage . </s>
<s> `` To get people 's attention these days , '' says Douglas Bailey , a political consultant , `` your TV ad needs to be bold and entertaining , and , more often than not , that means confrontational . </s>
<s> And , unlike a few years ago , you do n't even have to worry whether the ad is truthful . '' </s>
<s> In 1989 , as often as not , the principal fights in the major campaigns are prompted by the ads themselves . </s>
<s> Take a look , then , at the main attack commercials that set the tone for Tuesday 's elections in New York City , New Jersey and Virginia : </s>
<s> New York City : </s>
<s> The screen fills with a small , tight facial shot of David Dinkins , Democratic candidate for mayor of New York City . </s>
<s> `` David Dinkins failed to file his income taxes for four straight years , '' says a disembodied male voice . </s>
<s> And then this television commercial , paid for by Republican Rudolph Giuliani 's campaign and produced by Roger Ailes , the master of negative TV ads , really gets down to business . </s>
<s> Mr. Dinkins , the ad charges , also failed to report his campaign contributions accurately , hid his links to a failing insurance company and paid a convicted kidnapper `` through a phony organization with no members , no receipts and no office . '' </s>
<s> `` David Dinkins , '' says the kicker , `` Why does he always wait until he 's caught ? '' </s>
<s> `` Nasty innuendoes , '' says John Siegal , Mr. Dinkins 's issues director , `` designed to prosecute a case of political corruption that simply does n't exist . '' </s>
<s> Stung by the Giuliani ads , Mr. Dinkins 's TV consultants , Robert Shrum and David Doak , finally unleashed a negative ad of their own . </s>
<s> The screen shows two distorted , unrecognizable photos , presumably of two politicians . </s>
<s> `` Compare two candidates for mayor , '' says the announcer . </s>
<s> `` One says he 's for banning cop-killer bullets . </s>
<s> The other has opposed a ban on cop-killer bullets . </s>
<s> One claims he 's pro-choice . </s>
<s> The other has opposed a woman 's right to choose . '' </s>
<s> `` Funny thing , '' says the kicker , `` both these candidates are named Rudolph Giuliani . '' </s>
<s> Who 's telling the truth ? </s>
<s> Everybody -- and nobody . </s>
<s> It 's a classic situation of ads that are true but not always fully accurate . </s>
<s> Mr. Dinkins did fail to file his income taxes for four years , but he insists he voluntarily admitted the `` oversight '' when he was being considered for a city job . </s>
<s> He was on the board of an insurance company with financial problems , but he insists he made no secret of it . </s>
<s> The city 's Campaign Finance Board has refused to pay Mr. Dinkins $ 95,142 in matching funds because his campaign records are incomplete . </s>
<s> The campaign has blamed these reporting problems on computer errors . </s>
<s> And , says Mr. Dinkins , he did n't know the man his campaign paid for a get-out-the-vote effort had been convicted of kidnapping . </s>
<s> But , say Mr. Dinkins 's managers , he did have an office and his organization did have members . </s>
<s> Mr. Giuliani 's campaign chairman , Peter Powers , says the Dinkins ad is `` deceptive . '' </s>
<s> The other side , he argues , `` knows Giuliani has always been pro-choice , even though he has personal reservations . </s>
<s> They know he is generally opposed to cop-killer bullets , but that he had some reservations about the language in the legislation . '' </s>
<s> Virginia : </s>
<s> Democratic Lt. Gov. Douglas Wilder opened his gubernatorial battle with Republican Marshall Coleman with an abortion commercial produced by Frank Greer that analysts of every political persuasion agree was a tour de force . </s>
<s> Against a shot of Monticello superimposed on an American flag , an announcer talks about the `` strong tradition of freedom and individual liberty '' that Virginians have nurtured for generations . </s>
<s> Then , just as an image of the statue of Thomas Jefferson dissolves from the screen , the announcer continues : `` On the issue of abortion , Marshall Coleman wants to take away your right to choose and give it to the politicians . '' </s>
<s> That commercial -- which said Mr. Coleman wanted to take away the right of abortion `` even in cases of rape and incest , '' a charge Mr. Coleman denies -- changed the dynamics of the campaign , transforming it , at least in part , into a referendum on abortion . </s>
<s> The ad prompted Mr. Coleman , the former Virginia attorney general , to launch a series of advertisements created by Bob Goodman and designed to shake Mr. Wilder 's support among the very women who were attracted by the abortion ad . </s>
<s> The Coleman counterattack featured a close-up of a young woman in shadows and the ad suggested that she was recalling an unpleasant courtroom ordeal . </s>
<s> A voice says , `` C'mon , now , do n't you have boyfriends ? '' </s>
<s> Then an announcer interjects : `` It was Douglas Wilder who introduced a bill to force rape victims age 13 and younger to be interrogated about their private lives by lawyers for accused rapists . </s>
<s> So the next time Mr. Wilder talks about the rights of women , ask him about this law he tried to pass . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Wilder did introduce such legislation 17 years ago , but he did so at the request of a constituent , a common legislative technique used by lawmakers . </s>
<s> The legislation itself noted that it was introduced `` by request , '' and in 1983 Mr. Wilder introduced a bill to protect rape victims from unfounded interrogation . </s>
<s> `` People have grown tired of these ads and Coleman has gotten the stigma of being a negative campaigner , '' says Mark Rozell , a political scientist at Mary Washington College . </s>
<s> `` Wilder has managed to get across the idea that Coleman will say anything to get elected governor and -- more important -- has been able to put the onus for all the negative campaigning on Coleman . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Coleman said this week that he would devote the remainder of the political season to positive campaigning , but the truce lasted only hours . </s>
<s> By Tuesday night , television stations were carrying new ads featuring Mr. Coleman himself raising questions about Mr. Wilder 's sensitivity to rape victims . </s>
<s> New Jersey : </s>
<s> The attacks began when Democratic Rep. James Florio aired an ad featuring a drawing of Pinocchio and a photograph of Mr. Florio 's rival , Republican Rep. Jim Courter . </s>
<s> `` Remember Pinocchio ? '' says a female voice . </s>
<s> `` Consider Jim Courter . '' </s>
<s> And then this commercial , produced by Bob Squier , gets down to its own mean and dirty business . </s>
<s> Pictures of rusted oil drums swim into focus , and the female voice purrs , `` That hazardous waste on his -LCB- Mr. Courter 's -RCB- property -- the neighbors are suing for consumer fraud . '' </s>
<s> And the nose on Mr. Courter 's face grows . </s>
<s> The only fraud involved , cry Mr. Courter 's partisans , is the Florio commercial itself , and so the Courter campaign has responded with its own Pinocchio commercial , produced by Mr. Ailes . </s>
<s> In this one , the screen fills with photographs of both candidates . </s>
<s> `` Who 's really lying ? '' asks a female voice . </s>
<s> `` Florio 's lying , '' the voice goes on , because `` the barrel on Courter 's land ... contained heating oil , was cleaned up and caused no pollution . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Courter 's long nose shrinks while Mr. Florio 's grows . </s>
<s> Who 's telling the truth ? </s>
<s> Stephen Salmore , a political scientist at New Jersey 's Eagleton Institute , says it 's another example of an ad that 's true but not fully accurate . </s>
<s> Barrels were dumped on the Courter property , a complaint was made , but there is no evidence the barrels were a serious threat to the environment . </s>
<s> Even so , according to Mr. Salmore , the ad was `` devastating '' because it raised questions about Mr. Courter 's credibility . </s>
<s> But it 's building on a long tradition . </s>
<s> In 1966 , on route to a re-election rout of Democrat Frank O'Connor , GOP Gov. Nelson Rockefeller of New York appeared in person saying , `` If you want to keep the crime rates high , O'Connor is your man . '' </s>
