<s> Fujitsu Ltd. 's top executive took the unusual step of publicly apologizing for his company 's making bids of just one yen for several local government projects , while computer rival NEC Corp. made a written apology for indulging in the same practice . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , business and government leaders rebuked the computer makers , and fretted about the broader statement the companies ' actions make about Japanese cutthroat pricing . </s>
<s> Fujitsu said it bid the equivalent of less than a U.S. penny on three separate municipal contracts during the past two years . </s>
<s> The company also disclosed that during that period it offered 10,000 yen , or about $ 70 , for another contract . </s>
<s> But Fujitsu , Japan 's No. 1 computer maker , is n't alone . </s>
<s> NEC , one of its largest domestic competitors , said it bid one yen in two separate public auctions since 1987 . </s>
<s> In both cases , NEC lost the contract to Fujitsu , which made the same bid and won a tie-breaking lottery . </s>
<s> All the contracts were for computer-system-design contracts and involved no hardware or software . </s>
<s> The Ministry of International Trade and Industry summoned executives from the companies to `` make sure they understood '' the concern about such practices , according to a government spokesman . </s>
<s> `` These cases lead to the loss of the firms ' social and international credibility , '' a ministry statement said . </s>
<s> Japan 's Fair Trade Commission has said it is considering investigating the bids for possible antitrust-law violations . </s>
<s> `` We would like to apologize for having caused huge trouble , '' Fujitsu President Takuma Yamamoto , read from a prepared statement as he stood before a packed news conference at his company 's downtown headquarters . </s>
<s> The bids , he added , were `` contrary to common sense . '' </s>
<s> NEC released a statement saying , `` We feel sorry for having caused trouble to society , '' a form of apology common in Japan for companies caught in embarrassing situations . </s>
<s> Japanese companies have long had a reputation for sacrificing short-term profits to make a sale that may have long-term benefits . </s>
<s> But the growing controversy comes as many practices historically accepted as normal here -- such as politicians accepting substantial gifts from businessmen or having extramarital affairs -- are coming under close ethical scrutiny . </s>
<s> The fire is also fueled by growing international interest in Japanese behavior . </s>
<s> So far there have been no public overseas complaints about the issue . </s>
<s> But in one of the auctions in question , International Business Machines Corp. made a bid substantially higher than the Fujitsu offer , according to the municipality . </s>
<s> The low-ball bids touch on issues central to the increasingly tense trade debate . </s>
<s> Foreigners complain that they have limited access to government procurement in Japan , in part because Japanese companies unfairly undercut them . </s>
<s> The U.S. government in recent years has accused Japanese companies of excessively slashing prices on semiconductors and supercomputers -- products Fujitsu and NEC make . </s>
<s> Asked whether the bidding flap would hurt U.S.-Japan relations , Mr. Yamamoto said , `` this will be a minus factor . '' </s>
<s> The `` one-yen '' controversy first came to a head last week when the city of Hiroshima announced that Fujitsu won a contract to design a computer system to map its waterworks . </s>
<s> The city had expected to pay about 11 million yen -LRB- $ 77,000 -RRB- , but Fujitsu essentially offered to do it for free . </s>
<s> Then Wednesday , Fujitsu said it made a similar bid to win a library contract in Nagano prefecture two weeks earlier . </s>
<s> It also said that in July , it bid 10,000 yen to design a system for the Saitama prefectural library , and two years ago , it bid one yen to plan the telecommunications system for Wakayama prefecture . </s>
<s> The company said it has offered to withdraw its bids in Hiroshima and Nagano . </s>
<s> The municipalities said they have n't decided whether to try to force the company to go through with the contracts . </s>
<s> Fujitsu and NEC said they were still investigating , and that knowledge of more such bids could emerge . </s>
<s> Mr. Yamamoto insisted that headquarters had n't approved the bids , and that he did n't know about most of the cases until Wednesday . </s>
<s> Other major Japanese computer companies contacted yesterday said they have never made such bids . </s>
<s> `` One yen is not ethical , '' Michio Sasaki , an official at Keidanren , the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations , said . </s>
<s> `` Profit may be low , but at least costs should be covered . </s>
