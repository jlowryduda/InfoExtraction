<s> Investors unsettled by the stock market 's gyrations can take some comfort in the predictable arrival of quarterly dividend checks . </s>
<s> That has been particularly true this year with many companies raising their payouts more than 10 % . </s>
<s> But do n't breathe too easy : Those dividend increases may signal trouble ahead for stock prices , some analysts warn . </s>
<s> In the past , they say , the strongest dividend growth has often come at times when the stock-market party was almost over . </s>
<s> That can be a trap for unwary investors , says Richard Bernstein , senior quantitative analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co . </s>
<s> Strong dividend growth , he says , is `` the black widow of valuation '' -- a reference to the female spiders that attract males and then kill them after mating . </s>
<s> Stephen Boesel , president of T. Rowe Price Growth and Income Fund , explains that companies raise their payouts most robustly only after the economy and corporate profits have been growing for some time . </s>
<s> `` Invariably , those strong periods in the economy give way to recessionary environments , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` And recessionary environments are n't hospitable to the stock market . '' </s>
<s> Indeed , analysts say that payouts have sometimes risen most sharply when prices were already on their way down from cyclical peaks . </s>
<s> In 1976 , for example , dividends on the stocks in Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index soared 10 % , following much slower growth the year before . </s>
<s> The S&P index started sliding in price in September 1976 , and fell 12 % in 1977 -- despite a 15 % expansion in dividends that year . </s>
<s> That pattern has n't always held , but recent strong growth in dividends makes some market watchers anxious . </s>
<s> Payouts on the S&P 500 stocks rose 10 % in 1988 , according to Standard & Poor 's Corp. , and Wall Street estimates for 1989 growth are generally between 9 % and 14 % . </s>
<s> Many people believe the growth in dividends will slow next year , although a minority see double-digit gains continuing . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , many market watchers say recent dividend trends raise another warning flag : While dividends have risen smartly , their expansion has n't kept pace with even stronger advances in stock prices . </s>
<s> As a result , the market 's dividend yield -- dividends as a percentage of price -- has slid to a level that is fairly low and unenticing by historical standards . </s>
<s> Put another way , the decline in the yield suggests stocks have gotten pretty rich in price relative to the dividends they pay , some market analysts say . </s>
<s> They are keeping a close watch on the yield on the S&P 500 . </s>
<s> The figure is currently about 3.3 % , up from 3.2 % before the recent market slide . </s>
<s> Some analysts say investors should run for the exits if a sustained market rebound pushes the yield below 3 % . </s>
<s> A drop below that 3 % benchmark `` has always been a strong warning sign that stocks are fully valued , '' says Mr. Boesel of T. Rowe Price . </s>
<s> In fact , `` the market has always tanked . </s>
<s> Always . </s>
<s> There 's never been an exception , '' says Gerald W. Perritt , a Chicago investment adviser and money manager , based on a review of six decades of stock-market data . </s>
<s> The last time the S&P 500 yield dropped below 3 % was in the summer of 1987 . </s>
<s> Stockholders who took the hint and sold shares escaped the October debacle . </s>
<s> There have been only seven other times -- in 1929 , 1933 , 1961 , 1965 , 1968 , 1971 and 1972 -- when the yield on the S&P 500 dropped below 3 % for at least two consecutive months , Mr. Perritt found . </s>
<s> And in each case , he says , a sharp drop in stock prices began within a year . </s>
<s> Still , some market analysts say the current 3.3 % reading is n't as troublesome as it might have been in years past . </s>
<s> `` It 's not a very meaningful indicator currently because corporations are not behaving in a traditional manner , '' says James H. Coxon , head of stock investments for Cigna Corp. , the Philadelphia-based insurer . </s>
<s> In particular , Mr. Coxon says , businesses are paying out a smaller percentage of their profits and cash flow in the form of dividends than they have historically . </s>
<s> So , while stock prices may look fairly high relative to dividends , they are not excessive relative to the underlying corporate strength . </s>
<s> Rather than increasing dividends , some companies have used cash to buy back some of their shares , notes Steven G. Einhorn , co-chairman of the investment policy committee at Goldman , Sachs & Co . </s>
<s> He factors that into the market yield to get an adjusted yield of about 3.6 % . </s>
<s> That is just a tad below the average of the past 40 years or so , he says . </s>
<s> What will happen to dividend growth next year ? </s>
<s> Common wisdom suggests a single-digit rate of growth , reflecting a weakening in the economy and corporate profits . </s>
<s> PaineWebber Inc. , for instance , is forecasting growth in S&P 500 dividends of just under 5 % in 1990 , down from an estimated 11 % this year . </s>
<s> In other years in which there have been moderate economic slowdowns -- the environment the firm expects in 1990 -- the change in dividends ranged from a gain of 4 % to a decline of 1 % , according to PaineWebber analyst Thomas Doerflinger . </s>
<s> The minority argument , meanwhile , is that businesses have the financial wherewithal this time around to declare sharply higher dividends even if their earnings weaken . </s>
<s> Dividend growth on the order of 12 % is expected by both Mr. Coxon of Cigna and Mr. Einhorn of Goldman Sachs . </s>
<s> Those dividend bulls argue that corporations are in the unusual position of having plenty of cash left over after paying dividends and making capital expenditures . </s>
<s> One indicator investors might want to watch is the monthly tally from Standard & Poor 's of the number of public companies adjusting their dividends . </s>
<s> A total of 139 companies raised dividends in October , basically unchanged from 138 a year ago , S&P said Wednesday . </s>
<s> That followed four straight months in which the number of increases trailed the year-earlier pace . </s>
<s> While the S&P tally does n't measure the magnitude of dividend changes , a further slippage in the number of dividend increases could be a harbinger of slower dividend growth next year . </s>
<s> In any case , opinion is mixed on how much of a boost the overall stock market would get even if dividend growth continues at double-digit levels . </s>
<s> Mr. Einhorn of Goldman Sachs estimates the stock market will deliver a 12 % to 15 % total return from appreciation and dividends over the next 12 months -- vs. a `` cash rate of return '' of perhaps 7 % or 8 % if dividend growth is weak . </s>
<s> But Mr. Boesel of T. Rowe Price , who also expects 12 % growth in dividends next year , does n't think it will help the overall market all that much . </s>
<s> `` Having the dividend increases is a supportive element in the market outlook , but I do n't think it 's a main consideration , '' he says . </s>
<s> With slower economic growth and flat corporate earnings likely next year , `` I would n't look for the market to have much upside from current levels . </s>
