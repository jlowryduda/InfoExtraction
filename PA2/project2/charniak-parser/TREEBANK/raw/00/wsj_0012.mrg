<s> Newsweek , trying to keep pace with rival Time magazine , announced new advertising rates for 1990 and said it will introduce a new incentive plan for advertisers . </s>
<s> The new ad plan from Newsweek , a unit of the Washington Post Co. , is the second incentive plan the magazine has offered advertisers in three years . </s>
<s> Plans that give advertisers discounts for maintaining or increasing ad spending have become permanent fixtures at the news weeklies and underscore the fierce competition between Newsweek , Time Warner Inc. 's Time magazine , and Mortimer B. Zuckerman 's U.S. News & World Report . </s>
<s> Alan Spoon , recently named Newsweek president , said Newsweek 's ad rates would increase 5 % in January . </s>
<s> A full , four-color page in Newsweek will cost $ 100,980 . </s>
<s> In mid-October , Time magazine lowered its guaranteed circulation rate base for 1990 while not increasing ad page rates ; with a lower circulation base , Time 's ad rate will be effectively 7.5 % higher per subscriber ; a full page in Time costs about $ 120,000 . </s>
<s> U.S. News has yet to announce its 1990 ad rates . </s>
<s> Newsweek said it will introduce the Circulation Credit Plan , which awards space credits to advertisers on `` renewal advertising . '' </s>
<s> The magazine will reward with `` page bonuses '' advertisers who in 1990 meet or exceed their 1989 spending , as long as they spent $ 325,000 in 1989 and $ 340,000 in 1990 . </s>
<s> Mr. Spoon said the plan is not an attempt to shore up a decline in ad pages in the first nine months of 1989 ; Newsweek 's ad pages totaled 1,620 , a drop of 3.2 % from last year , according to Publishers Information Bureau . </s>
<s> `` What matters is what advertisers are paying per page , and in that department we are doing fine this fall , '' said Mr. Spoon . </s>
<s> Both Newsweek and U.S. News have been gaining circulation in recent years without heavy use of electronic giveaways to subscribers , such as telephones or watches . </s>
<s> However , none of the big three weeklies recorded circulation gains recently . </s>
<s> According to Audit Bureau of Circulations , Time , the largest newsweekly , had average circulation of 4,393,237 , a decrease of 7.3 % . </s>
<s> Newsweek 's circulation for the first six months of 1989 was 3,288,453 , flat from the same period last year . </s>
<s> U.S. News ' circulation in the same time was 2,303,328 , down 2.6 % . </s>
