<s> Sea Containers Ltd. said it might increase the price of its $ 70-a-share buy-back plan if pressed by Temple Holdings Ltd. , which made an earlier tender offer for Sea Containers . </s>
<s> Sea Containers , a Hamilton , Bermuda-based shipping concern , said Tuesday that it would sell $ 1.1 billion of assets and use some of the proceeds to buy about 50 % of its common shares for $ 70 apiece . </s>
<s> The move is designed to ward off a hostile takeover attempt by two European shipping concerns , Stena Holding AG and Tiphook PLC . </s>
<s> In May , the two companies , through their jointly owned holding company , Temple , offered $ 50 a share , or $ 777 million , for Sea Containers . </s>
<s> In August , Temple sweetened the offer to $ 63 a share , or $ 963 million . </s>
<s> Yesterday , Sea Containers ' chief executive officer , James Sherwood , said in an interview that , under the asset-sale plan , Sea Containers would end up with a cash surplus of approximately $ 620 million . </s>
<s> About $ 490 million of that would be allocated to the buy-back , leaving about $ 130 million , he said . </s>
<s> That $ 130 million , Mr. Sherwood said , `` gives us some flexibility in case Temple raises its bid . </s>
<s> We are able to increase our price above the $ 70 level if necessary . </s>
<s> '' He declined to say , however , how much Sea Containers might raise its price . </s>
<s> Mr. Sherwood speculated that the leeway that Sea Containers has means that Temple would have to `` substantially increase their bid if they 're going to top us . '' </s>
<s> Temple , however , harshly criticized Sea Containers ' plan yesterday , characterizing it as a `` highly conditional device designed to entrench management , confuse shareholders and prevent them from accepting our superior cash offer . '' </s>
<s> A spokesman for Temple estimated that Sea Containers ' plan -- if all the asset sales materialize -- would result in shareholders receiving only $ 36 to $ 45 a share in cash . </s>
<s> The lower figures , the spokesman said , would stem from preferred shares being converted to common stock and the possibility that Sea Containers ' subsidiaries might be required to place their shares in the open market . </s>
<s> Temple added that Sea Containers is still mired in legal problems in Bermuda , where the Supreme Court has temporarily barred Sea Containers from buying back its own stock in a case brought by Stena and Tiphook . </s>
<s> -LCB- The court has indicated it will rule on the case by the end of the month . -RCB- </s>
<s> Temple also said Sea Containers ' plan raises `` numerous legal , regulatory , financial and fairness issues , '' but did n't elaborate . </s>
<s> Mr. Sherwood said reaction to Sea Containers ' proposal has been `` very positive . '' </s>
<s> In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Sea Containers closed at $ 62.625 , up 62.5 cents . </s>
