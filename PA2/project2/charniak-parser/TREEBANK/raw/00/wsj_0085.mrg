<s> For 10 years , Genie Driskill went to her neighborhood bank because it was convenient . </s>
<s> A high-balance customer that banks pine for , she did n't give much thought to the rates she was receiving , nor to the fees she was paying . </s>
<s> But in August , First Atlanta National Bank introduced its Crown Account , a package designed to lure customers such as Ms. Driskill . </s>
<s> Among other things , it included checking , safe deposit box and credit card -- all for free -- plus a good deal on installment loans . </s>
<s> All she had to do was put $ 15,000 in a certificate of deposit , or qualify for a $ 10,000 personal line of credit . </s>
<s> `` I deserve something for my loyalty , '' she says . </s>
<s> She took her business to First Atlanta . </s>
<s> So it goes in the competitive world of consumer banking these days . </s>
<s> For nearly a decade , banks have competed for customers primarily with the interest rates they pay on their deposits and charge on their loans . </s>
<s> The competitive rates were generally offset by hefty fees on various services . </s>
<s> But many banks are turning away from strict price competition . </s>
<s> Instead , they are trying to build customer loyalty by bundling their services into packages and targeting them to small segments of the population . </s>
<s> `` You 're dead in the water if you are n't segmenting the market , '' says Anne Moore , president of Synergistics Research Corp. , a bank consulting firm in Atlanta . </s>
<s> NCNB Corp. of Charlotte , N.C. , recently introduced its Financial Connections Program aimed at young adults just starting careers . </s>
<s> The program not only offers a pre-approved car loan up to $ 18,000 , but throws in a special cash-flow statement to help in saving money . </s>
<s> In September , Union Planters Corp. of Memphis , Tenn. , launched The Edge account , a package designed for the `` thirtysomething '' crowd with services that include a credit card and line of credit with no annual fees , and a full percentage point off on installment loans . </s>
<s> The theory : Such individuals , many with young children , are in their prime borrowing years -- and , having borrowed from the bank , they may continue to use it for other services in later years . </s>
<s> For some time , banks have been aiming packages at the elderly , the demographic segment with the highest savings . </s>
<s> Those efforts are being stepped up . </s>
<s> Judie MacDonald , vice president of retail sales at Barnett Banks Inc. of Jacksonville , Fla. , says the company now targets sub-segments within the market by tailoring its popular Seniors Partners Program to various life styles . </s>
<s> `` Varying age , geography and life-style differences create numerous sub-markets , '' Ms. MacDonald says . </s>
<s> She says individual Barnett branches can add different benefits to their Seniors Partners package -- such as athletic activities or travel clubs -- to appeal to local market interests . </s>
<s> `` An active 55-year-old in Boca Raton may care more about Senior Olympic games , while a 75-year-old in Panama City may care more about a seminar on health , '' she says . </s>
<s> Banks have tried packaging before . </s>
<s> In 1973 , Wells Fargo & Co. of San Francisco launched the Gold Account , which included free checking , a credit card , safe-deposit box and travelers checks for a $ 3 monthly fee . </s>
<s> The concept begot a slew of copycats , but the banks stopped promoting the packages . </s>
<s> One big reason : thin margins . </s>
<s> Many banks , particularly smaller ones , were slow to computerize and could n't target market niches that would have made the programs more profitable . </s>
<s> As banks ' earnings were squeezed in the mid-1970s , the emphasis switched to finding ways to cut costs . </s>
<s> But now computers are enabling more banks to analyze their customers by age , income and geography . </s>
<s> They are better able to get to those segments in the wake of the deregulation that began in the late 1970s . </s>
<s> Deregulation has effectively removed all restrictions on what banks can pay for deposits , as well as opened up the field for new products such as high-rate CDs . </s>
<s> Where a bank once offered a standard passbook savings account , it began offering money-market accounts , certificates of deposit and interest-bearing checking , and staggering rates based on the size of deposits . </s>
<s> The competition has grown more intense as bigger banks such as Norwest Corp. of Minneapolis and Chemical Banking Corp. of New York extend their market-share battles into small towns across the nation . </s>
<s> `` Today , a banker is worrying about local , regional and money-center -LCB- banks -RCB- , as well as thrifts and credit unions , '' says Ms. Moore at Synergistics Research . </s>
<s> `` So people who were n't even thinking about targeting 10 years ago are scrambling to define their customer base . '' </s>
<s> The competition has cultivated a much savvier consumer . </s>
<s> `` The average household will spread 19 accounts over a dozen financial institutions , '' says Michael P. Sullivan , who runs his own bank consulting firm in Charlotte , N.C . </s>
<s> `` This much fragmentation makes attracting and keeping today 's rate-sensitive customers costly . '' </s>
<s> Packages encourage loyalty by rewarding customers for doing the bulk of their banking in one place . </s>
<s> For their troubles , the banks get a larger captive audience that is less likely to move at the drop of a rate . </s>
<s> The more accounts customers have , Mr. Sullivan says , the more likely they are to be attracted to a package -- and to be loyal to the bank that offers it . </s>
<s> That can pay off down the road as customers , especially the younger ones , change from borrowers to savers\/investors . </s>
<s> Packaging has some drawbacks . </s>
<s> The additional technology , personnel training and promotional effort can be expensive . </s>
<s> Chemical Bank spent more than $ 50 million to introduce its ChemPlus line , several packages aimed at different segments , in 1986 , according to Thomas Jacob , senior vice president of marketing . </s>
<s> `` It 's not easy to roll out something that comprehensive , and make it pay , '' Mr. Jacob says . </s>
<s> Still , bankers expect packaging to flourish , primarily because more customers are demanding that financial services be tailored to their needs . </s>
<s> `` These days , banking customers walk in the door expecting you to have a package especially for them , '' Ms. Moore says . </s>
<s> Some banks are already moving in that direction , according to Alvin T. Sale , marketing director at First Union Corp. in Charlotte . </s>
<s> First Union , he says , now has packages for seven customer groups . </s>
<s> Soon , it will split those into 30 . </s>
<s> Says Mr. Sale : `` I think more banks are starting to realize that we have to be more like the department store , not the boutique . '' </s>
<s> IRAs . </s>
