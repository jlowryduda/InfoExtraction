<s> A form of asbestos once used to make Kent cigarette filters has caused a high percentage of cancer deaths among a group of workers exposed to it more than 30 years ago , researchers reported . </s>
<s> The asbestos fiber , crocidolite , is unusually resilient once it enters the lungs , with even brief exposures to it causing symptoms that show up decades later , researchers said . </s>
<s> Lorillard Inc. , the unit of New York-based Loews Corp. that makes Kent cigarettes , stopped using crocidolite in its Micronite cigarette filters in 1956 . </s>
<s> Although preliminary findings were reported more than a year ago , the latest results appear in today 's New England Journal of Medicine , a forum likely to bring new attention to the problem . </s>
<s> A Lorillard spokewoman said , `` This is an old story . </s>
<s> We 're talking about years ago before anyone heard of asbestos having any questionable properties . </s>
<s> There is no asbestos in our products now . '' </s>
<s> Neither Lorillard nor the researchers who studied the workers were aware of any research on smokers of the Kent cigarettes . </s>
<s> `` We have no useful information on whether users are at risk , '' said James A. Talcott of Boston 's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute . </s>
<s> Dr. Talcott led a team of researchers from the National Cancer Institute and the medical schools of Harvard University and Boston University . </s>
<s> The Lorillard spokeswoman said asbestos was used in `` very modest amounts '' in making paper for the filters in the early 1950s and replaced with a different type of filter in 1956 . </s>
<s> From 1953 to 1955 , 9.8 billion Kent cigarettes with the filters were sold , the company said . </s>
<s> Among 33 men who worked closely with the substance , 28 have died -- more than three times the expected number . </s>
<s> Four of the five surviving workers have asbestos-related diseases , including three with recently diagnosed cancer . </s>
<s> The total of 18 deaths from malignant mesothelioma , lung cancer and asbestosis was far higher than expected , the researchers said . </s>
<s> `` The morbidity rate is a striking finding among those of us who study asbestos-related diseases , '' said Dr. Talcott . </s>
<s> The percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the West Groton , Mass. , paper factory appears to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied in Western industrialized countries , he said . </s>
<s> The plant , which is owned by Hollingsworth & Vose Co. , was under contract with Lorillard to make the cigarette filters . </s>
<s> The finding probably will support those who argue that the U.S. should regulate the class of asbestos including crocidolite more stringently than the common kind of asbestos , chrysotile , found in most schools and other buildings , Dr. Talcott said . </s>
<s> The U.S. is one of the few industrialized nations that does n't have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth , needle-like fibers such as crocidolite that are classified as amphobiles , according to Brooke T. Mossman , a professor of pathlogy at the University of Vermont College of Medicine . </s>
<s> More common chrysotile fibers are curly and are more easily rejected by the body , Dr. Mossman explained . </s>
<s> In July , the Environmental Protection Agency imposed a gradual ban on virtually all uses of asbestos . </s>
<s> By 1997 , almost all remaining uses of cancer-causing asbestos will be outlawed . </s>
<s> About 160 workers at a factory that made paper for the Kent filters were exposed to asbestos in the 1950s . </s>
<s> Areas of the factory were particularly dusty where the crocidolite was used . </s>
<s> Workers dumped large burlap sacks of the imported material into a huge bin , poured in cotton and acetate fibers and mechanically mixed the dry fibers in a process used to make filters . </s>
<s> Workers described `` clouds of blue dust '' that hung over parts of the factory , even though exhaust fans ventilated the area . </s>
<s> `` There 's no question that some of those workers and managers contracted asbestos-related diseases , '' said Darrell Phillips , vice president of human resources for Hollingsworth & Vose . </s>
<s> `` But you have to recognize that these events took place 35 years ago . </s>
<s> It has no bearing on our work force today . </s>
