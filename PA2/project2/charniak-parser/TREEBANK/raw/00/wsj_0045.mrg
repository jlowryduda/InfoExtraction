<s> Since chalk first touched slate , schoolchildren have wanted to know : What 's on the test ? </s>
<s> These days , students can often find the answer in test-coaching workbooks and worksheets their teachers give them in the weeks prior to taking standardized achievement tests . </s>
<s> The mathematics section of the widely used California Achievement Test asks fifth graders : `` What is another name for the Roman numeral IX ? '' </s>
<s> It also asks them to add two-sevenths and three-sevenths . </s>
<s> Worksheets in a test-practice kit called Learning Materials , sold to schools across the country by Macmillan\/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Co. , contain the same questions . </s>
<s> In many other instances , there is almost no difference between the real test and Learning Materials . </s>
<s> What 's more , the test and Learning Materials are both produced by the same company , Macmillan\/McGraw-Hill , a joint venture of McGraw-Hill Inc. and Macmillan 's parent , Britain 's Maxwell Communication Corp . </s>
<s> Close parallels between tests and practice tests are common , some educators and researchers say . </s>
<s> Test-preparation booklets , software and worksheets are a booming publishing subindustry . </s>
<s> But some practice products are so similar to the tests themselves that critics say they represent a form of school-sponsored cheating . </s>
<s> `` If I took -LCB- these preparation booklets -RCB- into my classroom , I 'd have a hard time justifying to my students and parents that it was n't cheating , '' says John Kaminski , a Traverse City , Mich. , teacher who has studied test coaching . </s>
<s> He and other critics say such coaching aids can defeat the purpose of standardized tests , which is to gauge learning progress . </s>
<s> `` It 's as if France decided to give only French history questions to students in a European history class , and when everybody aces the test , they say their kids are good in European history , '' says John Cannell , an Albuquerque , N.M. , psychiatrist and founder of an educational research organization , Friends for Education , which has studied standardized testing . </s>
<s> Standardized achievement tests are given about 10 million times a year across the country to students generally from kindergarten through eighth grade . </s>
<s> The most widely used of these tests are Macmillan\/McGraw 's CAT and Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills ; the Iowa Test of Basic Skills , by Houghton Mifflin Co. ; and Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. 's Metropolitan Achievement Test and Stanford Achievement Test . </s>
<s> Sales figures of the test-prep materials are n't known , but their reach into schools is significant . </s>
<s> In Arizona , California , Florida , Louisiana , Maryland , New Jersey , South Carolina and Texas , educators say they are common classroom tools . </s>
<s> Macmillan\/McGraw says `` well over 10 million '' of its Scoring High test-preparation books have been sold since their introduction 10 years ago , with most sales in the last five years . </s>
<s> About 20,000 sets of Learning Materials teachers ' binders have also been sold in the past four years . </s>
<s> The materials in each set reach about 90 students . </s>
<s> Scoring High and Learning Materials are the best-selling preparation tests . </s>
<s> Michael Kean , director of marketing for CTB Macmillan\/McGraw , the Macmillan\/McGraw division that publishes Learning Materials , says it is n't aimed at improving test scores . </s>
<s> He also asserted that exact questions were n't replicated . </s>
<s> When referred to the questions that matched , he said it was coincidental . </s>
<s> Mr. Kaminski , the schoolteacher , and William Mehrens , a Michigan State University education professor , concluded in a study last June that CAT test versions of Scoring High and Learning Materials should n't be used in the classroom because of their similarity to the actual test . </s>
<s> They devised a 69-point scale -- awarding one point for each subskill measured on the CAT test -- to rate the closeness of test preparatives to the fifth-grade CAT . </s>
<s> Because many of these subskills -- the symmetry of geometrical figures , metric measurement of volume , or pie and bar graphs , for example -- are only a small part of the total fifth-grade curriculum , Mr. Kaminski says , the preparation kits would n't replicate too many , if their real intent was general instruction or even general familiarization with test procedures . </s>
<s> But Learning Materials matched on 66.5 of 69 subskills . </s>
<s> Scoring High matched on 64.5 . </s>
<s> In CAT sections where students ' knowledge of two-letter consonant sounds is tested , the authors noted that Scoring High concentrated on the same sounds that the test does -- to the exclusion of other sounds that fifth graders should know . </s>
<s> Learning Materials for the fifth-grade contains at least a dozen examples of exact matches or close parallels to test items . </s>
<s> Rick Brownell , senior editor of Scoring High , says that Messrs. Kaminski and Mehrens are ignoring `` the need students have for becoming familiar with tests and testing format . '' </s>
<s> He said authors of Scoring High `` scrupulously avoid '' replicating exact questions , but he does n't deny that some items are similar . </s>
<s> When Scoring High first came out in 1979 , it was a publication of Random House . </s>
<s> McGraw-Hill was outraged . </s>
<s> In a 1985 advisory to educators , McGraw-Hill said Scoring High should n't be used because it represented a `` parallel form '' of the CAT and CTBS tests . </s>
<s> But in 1988 , McGraw-Hill purchased the Random House unit that publishes Scoring High , which later became part of Macmillan\/McGraw . </s>
<s> Messrs. Brownell and Kean say they are unaware of any efforts by McGraw-Hill to modify or discontinue Scoring High . </s>
