<s> The survival of spinoff Cray Computer Corp. as a fledgling in the supercomputer business appears to depend heavily on the creativity -- and longevity -- of its chairman and chief designer , Seymour Cray . </s>
<s> Not only is development of the new company 's initial machine tied directly to Mr. Cray , so is its balance sheet . </s>
<s> Documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the pending spinoff disclosed that Cray Research Inc. will withdraw the almost $ 100 million in financing it is providing the new firm if Mr. Cray leaves or if the product-design project he heads is scrapped . </s>
<s> The documents also said that although the 64-year-old Mr. Cray has been working on the project for more than six years , the Cray-3 machine is at least another year away from a fully operational prototype . </s>
<s> Moreover , there have been no orders for the Cray-3 so far , though the company says it is talking with several prospects . </s>
<s> While many of the risks were anticipated when Minneapolis-based Cray Research first announced the spinoff in May , the strings it attached to the financing had n't been made public until yesterday . </s>
<s> `` We did n't have much of a choice , '' Cray Computer 's chief financial officer , Gregory Barnum , said in an interview . </s>
<s> `` The theory is that Seymour is the chief designer of the Cray-3 , and without him it could not be completed . </s>
<s> Cray Research did not want to fund a project that did not include Seymour . '' </s>
<s> The documents also said that Cray Computer anticipates needing perhaps another $ 120 million in financing beginning next September . </s>
<s> But Mr. Barnum called that `` a worst-case '' scenario . </s>
<s> The filing on the details of the spinoff caused Cray Research stock to jump $ 2.875 yesterday to close at $ 38 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading . </s>
<s> Analysts noted yesterday that Cray Research 's decision to link its $ 98.3 million promissory note to Mr. Cray 's presence will complicate a valuation of the new company . </s>
<s> `` It has to be considered as an additional risk for the investor , '' said Gary P. Smaby of Smaby Group Inc. , Minneapolis . </s>
<s> `` Cray Computer will be a concept stock , '' he said . </s>
<s> `` You either believe Seymour can do it again or you do n't . '' </s>
<s> Besides the designer 's age , other risk factors for Mr. Cray 's new company include the Cray-3 's tricky , unproven chip technology . </s>
<s> The SEC documents describe those chips , which are made of gallium arsenide , as being so fragile and minute they will require special robotic handling equipment . </s>
<s> In addition , the Cray-3 will contain 16 processors -- twice as many as the largest current supercomputer . </s>
<s> Cray Computer also will face intense competition , not only from Cray Research , which has about 60 % of the world-wide supercomputer market and which is expected to roll out the C-90 machine , a direct competitor with the Cray-3 , in 1991 . </s>
<s> The spinoff also will compete with International Business Machines Corp. and Japan 's Big Three -- Hitachi Ltd. , NEC Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd . </s>
<s> The new company said it believes there are fewer than 100 potential customers for supercomputers priced between $ 15 million and $ 30 million -- presumably the Cray-3 price range . </s>
<s> Under terms of the spinoff , Cray Research stockholders are to receive one Cray Computer share for every two Cray Research shares they own in a distribution expected to occur in about two weeks . </s>
<s> No price for the new shares has been set . </s>
<s> Instead , the companies will leave it up to the marketplace to decide . </s>
<s> Cray Computer has applied to trade on Nasdaq . </s>
<s> Analysts calculate Cray Computer 's initial book value at about $ 4.75 a share . </s>
<s> Along with the note , Cray Research is transferring about $ 53 million in assets , primarily those related to the Cray-3 development , which has been a drain on Cray Research 's earnings . </s>
<s> Pro-forma balance sheets clearly show why Cray Research favored the spinoff . </s>
<s> Without the Cray-3 research and development expenses , the company would have been able to report a profit of $ 19.3 million for the first half of 1989 rather than the $ 5.9 million it posted . </s>
<s> On the other hand , had it existed then , Cray Computer would have incurred a $ 20.5 million loss . </s>
<s> Mr. Cray , who could n't be reached for comment , will work for the new Colorado Springs , Colo. , company as an independent contractor -- the arrangement he had with Cray Research . </s>
<s> Regarded as the father of the supercomputer , Mr. Cray was paid $ 600,000 at Cray Research last year . </s>
<s> At Cray Computer , he will be paid $ 240,000 . </s>
<s> Besides Messrs. Cray and Barnum , other senior management at the company includes Neil Davenport , 47 , president and chief executive officer ; Joseph M. Blanchard , 37 , vice president , engineering ; Malcolm A. Hammerton , 40 , vice president , software ; and Douglas R. Wheeland , 45 , vice president , hardware . </s>
<s> All came from Cray Research . </s>
<s> Cray Computer , which currently employs 241 people , said it expects a work force of 450 by the end of 1990 . </s>
