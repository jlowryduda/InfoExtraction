<s> Two Japanese scientists said they discovered an antibody that , in laboratory test-tube experiments , kills AIDS-infected cells while preserving healthy cells . </s>
<s> If further experiments are successful , the work would represent a major advance in research on acquired immune deficiency syndrome . </s>
<s> The drug AZT , the only treatment currently on the market , claims only to help stop the spread of AIDS , not to cure it . </s>
<s> But several analysts and Japanese scientists familiar with the study , which was announced at a conference in Nagoya yesterday , expressed skepticism over the significance of the results . </s>
<s> And the researchers themselves acknowledged they still must do much more work before they can say whether the treatment would actually cure humans . </s>
<s> Shin Yonehara , a research scientist at the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science , said the antibody he discovered works by recognizing an antigen called a Fas-antigen , which is characteristic of an infected cell . </s>
<s> The antibody then kills the cell . </s>
<s> Dr. Yonehara and his partner , Nobuyuki Kobayashi of Yamaguchi University , said their experiments showed that the antibody wiped out an average of 60 % of AIDS-infected cells within three days . </s>
<s> In some of the experiments , it killed almost all the infected cells , the researchers said . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , fewer than 10 % of the healthy cells were killed . </s>
<s> The two said they must still do more laboratory tests , then experiment on animals . </s>
<s> They said they hoped to conduct tests on human patients in the U.S. by late next year . </s>
<s> Japan does n't have enough AIDS patients to do significant experimentation in that country , they said . </s>
<s> The announcement got wide exposure in the Japanese media , and even moved some pharmaceutical stocks yesterday . </s>
<s> But Takashi Kitamura , director of the biology department at Japan 's National Institute of Health and secretary of the government 's AIDS-research center , said , `` I 'm not so optimistic of its future use in therapeutic methods . '' </s>
<s> He said some infected cells may not have the relevant antigen and so would n't be killed even after exposure to the antibody . </s>
<s> `` The results seem to be very premature , '' said Mitsuru Miyata , editor of Nikkei Biotechnology , a leading Japanese industry newsletter . </s>
<s> Dr. Kobayashi responded that he thought the antibody could potentially kill all infected cells . </s>
<s> But he and Dr. Yonehara said there were still several uncertainties , particularly regarding possible side effects . </s>
<s> `` Our antibody specifically killed infected cells at a very low dose , but it can also kill other cells , '' said Dr. Yonehara . </s>
<s> `` We do n't know the effect of our antibody on the human body . '' </s>
<s> AIDS is n't considered a widespread problem in Japan -- the government reports about 1,000 known carriers of the virus -- but many companies have poured substantial resources into research in recent years , hoping to cash in on a possible cure . </s>
<s> Dr. Kitamura said about 35 projects are currently under way in Japan , and that Japanese researchers in the past year have made available three possible cures to American researchers for clinical tests . </s>
<s> He said that when scientists from the two countries meet again in January in New Orleans , the Japanese will present at least three more drugs for human testing . </s>
<s> AZT is the world 's only prescription medicine approved for treating the disease . </s>
<s> Wellcome PLC , a major British pharmaceutical maker , sells the drug under the name Retrovir . </s>
<s> A Wellcome spokesman declined to comment on the discovery of the antibody in Japan . </s>
<s> But Andrew Porter , a drug-industry analyst at Nikko Securities Co. in London , said if the product were to be successfully developed it would represent `` a potential threat to the long-term viability of Retrovir . </s>
