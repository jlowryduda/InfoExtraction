<s> Conasupo Director Ignacio Ovalle Fernandez said the agency will sell 589 midsized supermarkets and several food-production plants and warehouses beginning early next year . </s>
<s> The agency will withdraw from the production of nine food products , maintaining production of the two most important ones , corn and milk . </s>
<s> Mr. Ovalle also said Conasupo will cut back subsidies to producers of nonessential farm products and close retail outlets in wealthy neighborhoods . </s>
<s> The agency 's workers and private companies would be allowed to bid for the assets up for sale . </s>
<s> Conasupo controls prices on agricultural goods and operates retail outlets where basic consumer items are sold at state-subsidized prices . </s>
<s> Business leaders have long criticized the agency as a leading example of bureacratic waste . </s>
<s> Private-sector leaders praised the Conasupo restructuring . </s>
<s> But most economists doubt the streamlining would cut deeply into Conasupo government subsidy , which largely goes to reduce consumer prices for corn and milk . </s>
