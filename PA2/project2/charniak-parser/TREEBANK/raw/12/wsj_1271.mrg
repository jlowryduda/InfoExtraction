<s> About 400,000 commuters trying to find their way through the Bay area 's quake-torn transportation system wedged cheek-to-jowl into subways , sat in traffic jams on major freeways or waited forlornly for buses yesterday . </s>
<s> In other words , it was a better-than-average Manhattan commute . </s>
<s> City officials feared widespread gridlock on the first day that normal business operations were resumed following last Tuesday 's earthquake . </s>
<s> The massive temblor , which killed at least 61 people , severed the Bay Bridge , a major artery to the east , and closed most ramps leading to and from Highway 101 , the biggest artery to the south . </s>
<s> It will take several weeks to repair the bridge , and several months to repair some of the 101 connections . </s>
<s> But in spite of a wind-driven rainstorm , gridlock never materialized , mainly because the Bay Area Rapid Transit subway system carried 50 % more passengers than normal . </s>
<s> For the first time in memory , it was standing-room only in BART 's sleek , modern railcars . </s>
<s> Moreover , the two main bridges still connecting San Francisco with the East Bay did n't charge tolls , allowing traffic to zip through without stopping . </s>
<s> Officials also suspect that traffic benefited from steps by major employers to get workers to come in at odd hours , or that many workers are still staying at home . </s>
<s> Many commuters who normally drove across the Bay Bridge , which is shut down for several weeks because of damage to one span , actually may have reached work a bit faster on BART yesterday , provided they could find a parking space at the system 's jammed stations . </s>
<s> In the best of times , the Bay Bridge is the worst commute in the region , often experiencing back-ups of 20 to 30 minutes or more . </s>
<s> Not that getting into town was easy . </s>
<s> Storm flooding caused back-ups on the freeway , and many commuters had to find rides to BART 's stations , because parking lots were full before dawn . </s>
<s> Bus schedules were sometimes in disarray , stranding commuters such as Marilyn Sullivan . </s>
<s> Her commute from Petaluma , Calif. , normally takes an hour and 15 minutes , via the Golden Gate Bridge , which connects San Francisco with the North Bay area . </s>
<s> Yesterday , she was still waiting at a bus stop after three hours , trying to transfer to a bus going to the financial district . </s>
<s> `` It 's worse than I thought , '' she said . </s>
<s> `` I do n't know where all the buses are . '' </s>
<s> But while traffic was heavy early in the commute over the Golden Gate , by 8 a.m. it already had thinned out . </s>
<s> `` It 's one of the smoothest commutes I 've ever had , '' said Charles Catania , an insurance broker on the bus from Mill Valley in Marin County . </s>
<s> `` It looks like a holiday . </s>
<s> I think a lot of people got scared and stayed home . '' </s>
<s> However , a spokeswoman for BankAmerica Corp. said yesterday 's absenteeism at the bank holding company was no greater than on an average day . </s>
<s> At the San Mateo Bridge , which connects the San Francisco peninsula with the East Bay , police were surprised at the speed with which traffic moved . </s>
<s> `` Everybody pretty much pitched in and cooperated , '' said Stan Perez , a sergeant with the California Highway Patrol . </s>
<s> There were many indications that the new work hours implemented by major corporations played a big role . </s>
<s> The Golden Gate handled as many cars as normally yesterday , but over four hours rather than the usual two-hour crush . </s>
<s> Bechtel Group Inc. , the giant closely held engineering concern , says it has instituted a 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. flextime arrangement , whereby employees may select any eight-hour period during those hours to go to work . </s>
<s> Of Bechtel 's 17,500 employees , about 4,000 work in San Francisco -- one-third of them commuting from stricken East Bay . </s>
<s> Pacific Gas & Electric Co. is offering its 6,000 San Francisco employees a two-tier flextime schedule -- either 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. or 10 a.m. to 6 p.m . </s>
<s> The flextime may cut by almost a third the number of PG&E employees working conventional 9-5 hours , a spokesman says . </s>
<s> Some of the utility 's employees may opt for a four-day workweek , 10 hours a day , to cut the commute by 20 % . </s>
<s> At Pacific Telesis Group , flextime is left up to individual working groups , because some of the telephone company 's employees must be on-site during normal business hours , a spokeswoman says . </s>
<s> Some individuals went to some lengths on their own to avoid the anticipated gridlock . </s>
<s> One senior vice president at Bechtel said he got up at 3 a.m. to drive into San Francisco from the East Bay . </s>
<s> But transportation officials worry that such extraordinary measures and cooperation may not last . </s>
<s> Although one transportation official said drivers who did n't use car pools were committing `` an anti-social act , '' about two-thirds of the motorists crossing the Golden Gate were alone , compared with the normal 70 % rate . </s>
<s> And some commuters , relieved by the absence of gridlock , were planning to return to their old ways . </s>
