<s> In a nondescript office building south of Los Angeles , human behavior is being monitored , dissected and , ultimately , manipulated . </s>
<s> A squiggly line snakes across a video screen , gyrating erratically as subjects with hand-held computers register their second-by-second reactions to a speaker 's remarks . </s>
<s> Agreement , disapproval , boredom and distraction all can be inferred from the subjects ' twist of a dial . </s>
<s> In another experiment , an elaborate chart with color codes reveals how people 's opinions were shaped -- and how they can be reshaped . </s>
<s> Donald Vinson , who oversees the experiments , is n't some white-coated researcher . </s>
<s> He heads Litigation Sciences Inc. , the nation 's largest legal consulting firm , which is helping corporate America prepare for high-stakes litigation by predicting and shaping jurors ' reactions . </s>
<s> In the process , Litigation Sciences is quietly but inexorably reshaping the world of law . </s>
<s> Little known outside the legal world but a powerhouse within , Litigation Sciences , a unit of Saatchi & Saatchi PLC , employs more than 100 psychologists , sociologists , marketers , graphic artists and technicians . </s>
<s> Twenty-one of its workers are Ph. D.s . </s>
<s> Among other services , the firm provides pre-trial opinion polls , creates profiles of `` ideal '' jurors , sets up mock trials and `` shadow '' juries , coaches lawyers and witnesses , and designs courtroom graphics . </s>
<s> Much like their cohorts in political consulting and product marketing , the litigation advisers encourage their clients to play down complex or ambiguous matters , simplify their messages and provide their target audiences with a psychological craving to make the desired choice . </s>
<s> With jury verdicts getting bigger all the time , companies are increasingly willing to pay huge sums for such advice . </s>
<s> Recently , Litigation Sciences helped Pennzoil Co. win a $ 10.5 billion jury verdict against Texaco Inc . </s>
<s> It advised the National Football League in its largely successful defense of antitrust charges by the United States Football League . </s>
<s> And it helped win defense verdicts in product-liability suits involving scores of products , ranging from Firestone 500 tires to the anti-nausea drug Bendectin . </s>
<s> Largely as a result , Litigation Sciences has more than doubled in size in the past two years . </s>
<s> Its 1988 revenue was $ 25 million . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , competitors are being spawned almost daily ; some 300 new businesses -- many just one-person shops -- have sprung up . </s>
<s> Mr. Vinson estimates the industry 's total revenues approach $ 200 million . </s>
<s> In any high-stakes case , you can be sure that one side or the other -- or even both -- is using litigation consultants . </s>
<s> Despite their ubiquity , the consultants are n't entirely welcome . </s>
<s> Some lawyers and scholars see the social scientists ' vision of the American jury system as a far cry from the ideal presented in civics texts and memorialized on the movie screen . </s>
<s> In the film classic `` Twelve Angry Men , '' the crucible of deliberations unmasks each juror 's bias and purges it from playing a role in the verdict . </s>
<s> After hours of conflict and debate , that jury focuses on the facts with near-perfect objectivity . </s>
<s> In real life , jurors may not always work that way , but some court observers question why they should n't be encouraged to do so rather than be programmed not to . </s>
<s> Litigation consulting is , as New York trial attorney Donald Zoeller puts it , `` highly manipulative . '' </s>
<s> He adds , `` The notion they try to sell is that juries do n't make decisions rationally . </s>
<s> But the effort is also being made to try and cause jurors not to decide things rationally . </s>
<s> I find it troubling . '' </s>
<s> But Mr. Zoeller also acknowledges that consultants can be very effective . </s>
<s> `` It 's gotten to the point where if the case is large enough , it 's almost malpractice not to use them , '' he says . </s>
<s> Others complain that the consultants ' growing influence exacerbates the advantage of litigants wealthy enough to afford such pricey services . </s>
<s> `` The affluent people and the corporations can buy it , the poor radicals -LCB- in political cases -RCB- get it free , and everybody in between is at a disadvantage , and that 's not the kind of system we want , '' says Amitai Etzioni , a prominent sociologist who teaches at George Washington University . </s>
<s> Sophisticated trial consulting grew , ironically , from the radical political movements of the 1960s and 1970s before finding its more lucrative calling in big commercial cases . </s>
<s> The Harrisburg 7 trial in 1972 , in which Daniel Berrigan and others were charged with plotting anti-war-related violence , was a landmark . </s>
<s> In that case , a group of left-leaning sociologists interviewed 252 registered voters around Harrisburg . </s>
<s> The researchers discovered that Episcopalians , Presbyterians , Methodists and fundamantalist Protestants were nearly always against the defendants ; the lawyers resolved to try to keep them off the jury . </s>
<s> The defense also learned that college-educated people were uncharacteristically conservative about the Vietnam War . </s>
<s> A more blue-collar panel became a second aim . </s>
<s> Ultimately , that carefully picked jury deadlocked with a 10-2 vote to acquit , and the prosecution decided not to retry the case . </s>
<s> Litigation consulting had arrived . </s>
<s> The fledgling science went corporate in 1977 when International Business Machines Corp. hired a marketing professor to help defend a complex antitrust case . </s>
<s> The problem for IBM trial lawyers Thomas Barr and David Boies was how to make such a highly technical case understandable . </s>
<s> As the trial progressed , they were eager to know if the jury was keeping up with them . </s>
<s> The solution devised by the professor was to hire six people who would mirror the actual jury demographically , sit in on the trial and report their reactions to him . </s>
<s> He then briefed Messrs. Boies and Barr , who had the chance to tilt their next day 's presentation accordingly . </s>
<s> Thus , the `` shadow '' jury was born . </s>
<s> Mr. Vinson , the professor , got the law bug and formed Litigation Sciences . </s>
<s> -LRB- IBM won the case . -RRB- </s>
<s> `` The hardest thing in any complex case is to retain objectivity and , in some sense , your ignorance , '' says Mr. Boies of Cravath , Swaine & Moore . </s>
<s> `` What you look for in a shadow jury is very much what you do when you give an opening argument to your wife or a friend and get some response to it . </s>
<s> A shadow jury is a way to do that in a more systematic and organized way . '' </s>
<s> The approach worked well in the recent antitrust case in which Energy Transportation Systems Inc. sued Santa Fe Pacific Corp. over the transport of semi-liquefied coal -- the kind of case likely to make almost anyone 's eyes glaze over . </s>
<s> Energy Transportation retained Litigation Sciences , at a cost of several hundred thousand dollars , to poll , pre-try , profile and shadow . </s>
<s> Just before the actual closing arguments , the firm put the case to a vote of the five shadow jurors , each of whom was being paid $ 150 a day . </s>
<s> The jurors , who did n't know which side had retained them , decided for Energy Transportation , and awarded $ 500 million in damages . </s>
<s> The real jury returned days later with a $ 345 million victory for Energy Transportation . </s>
<s> `` It 's just like weather forecasting , '' says Energy Transportation trial attorney Harry Reasoner of Vinson & Elkins . </s>
<s> `` It 's often wrong , but it 's better than consulting an Indian rain dancer . '' </s>
<s> Forecasting is only one part of Litigation Sciences ' work . </s>
<s> Changing the outcome of the trial is what really matters . </s>
<s> And to the uninitiated , some of the firm 's approaches may seem chillingly manipulative . </s>
<s> Theoretically , jurors are supposed to weigh the evidence in a case logically and objectively . </s>
<s> Instead , Mr. Vinson says , interviews with thousands of jurors reveal that they start with firmly entrenched attitudes and try to shoe-horn the facts of the case to fit their views . </s>
<s> Pre-trial polling helps the consultants develop a profile of the right type of juror . </s>
<s> If it is a case in which the client seeks punitive damages , for example , depressed , underemployed people are far more likely to grant them . </s>
<s> Someone with a master 's degree in classical arts who works in a deli would be ideal , Litigation Sciences advises . </s>
<s> So would someone recently divorced or widowed . </s>
<s> -LRB- Since Litigation Sciences generally represents the defense , its job is usually to help the lawyers identify and remove such people from the jury . -RRB- </s>
<s> For personal-injury cases , Litigation Sciences seeks defense jurors who believe that most people , including victims , get what they deserve . </s>
<s> Such people also typically hold negative attitudes toward the physically handicapped , the poor , blacks and women . </s>
<s> The consultants help the defense lawyers find such jurors by asking questions about potential jurors ' attitudes toward volunteer work , or toward particular movies or books . </s>
<s> Litigation Sciences does n't make moral distinctions . </s>
<s> If a client needs prejudiced jurors , the firm will help find them . </s>
<s> As Mr. Vinson explains it , `` We do n't control the facts . </s>
<s> They are what they are . </s>
<s> But any lawyer will select the facts and the strategy to employ . </s>
<s> In our system of advocacy , the trial lawyer is duty bound to present the best case he possibly can . '' </s>
<s> Once a jury is selected , the consultants often continue to determine what the jurors ' attitudes are likely to be and help shape the lawyers ' presentation accordingly . </s>
<s> Logic plays a minimal role here . </s>
<s> More important are what LSI calls `` psychological anchors '' -- a few focal points calculated to appeal to the jury on a gut level . </s>
<s> In one personal-injury case , a woman claimed she had been injured when she slipped in a pool , but the fall did n't explain why one of her arms was discolored bluish . </s>
<s> By repeatedly drawing the jury 's attention to the arm , the defense lawyers planted doubt about the origin of the woman 's injuries . </s>
<s> The ploy worked . </s>
<s> The defense won . </s>
<s> In a classic defense of a personal-injury case , the consultants concentrate on encouraging the jury to shift the blame . </s>
<s> `` The ideal defense in a case involving an accident is to persuade the jurors to hold the accident victim responsible for his or her plight , '' Mr. Vinson has written . </s>
<s> Slick graphics , pre-tested for effectiveness , also play a major role in Litigation Sciences ' operation . </s>
<s> Studies show , the consultants say , that people absorb information better and remember it longer if they receive it visually . </s>
<s> Computer-generated videos help . </s>
<s> `` The average American watches seven hours of TV a day . </s>
<s> They are very visually sophisticated , '' explains LSI graphics specialist Robert Seltzer . </s>
<s> Lawyers remain divided about whether anything is wrong with all this . </s>
<s> Supporters acknowledge that the process aims to manipulate , but they insist that the best trial lawyers have always employed similar tactics . </s>
<s> `` They may not have been able to articulate it all , but they did it , '' says Stephen Gillers , a legal ethics expert at New York University law school . </s>
<s> `` What you have here is intuition made manifest . '' </s>
<s> Many lawyers maintain that all 's fair in the adversary system as long as no one tampers with the evidence . </s>
<s> Others point out that lawyers in small communities have always had a feel for public sentiment -- and used that to advantage . </s>
<s> Litigation consulting is n't a guarantee of a favorable outcome . </s>
<s> Litigation Sciences concedes that in one in 20 cases it was flatout wrong in its predictions . </s>
<s> A few attorneys offer horror stories of jobs botched by consultants or of overpriced services -- as when one lawyer paid a consultant -LRB- not at Litigation Sciences -RRB- $ 70,000 to interview a jury after a big trial and later read more informative interviews with the same jurors in The American Lawyer magazine . </s>
<s> Some litigators scoff at the notion that a sociologist knows more than they do about what makes a jury tick . </s>
<s> `` The essence of being a trial lawyer is understanding how people of diverse backgrounds react to you and your presentation , '' says Barry Ostrager of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett , who recently won a huge case on behalf of insurers against Shell Oil Co . </s>
<s> He says he used consultants in the case but `` found them to be virtually useless . '' </s>
<s> But most lawyers accept that the marketplace has spoken . </s>
<s> And the question remains whether the jury system can maintain its integrity while undergoing such a skillful massage . </s>
<s> For more than a decade , Mr. Etzioni , the sociologist , has been a leading critic of the masseurs . </s>
<s> `` There 's no reason to believe that juries rule inappropriately , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` But the last thing you want to do is manipulate the subconscious to make them think better . </s>
<s> What you then do is you make them think inappropriately . '' </s>
<s> To hamper the work of litigation scientists , he suggests that courts sharply limit the number of jurors that lawyers can remove from the jury panel through so-called peremptory challenges -- exclusions that do n't require explanations . </s>
<s> In most civil cases , judges allow each side three such challenges . </s>
<s> For complex cases , judges sometimes allow many more . </s>
<s> Mr. Etzioni also suggests forbidding anyone from gathering background information about the jurors . </s>
<s> -LRB- Some courts release names and addresses , and researchers can drive by houses , look up credit ratings , and even question neighbors . -RRB- </s>
<s> Furthermore , he says , psychologists should not be allowed to analyze jurors ' personalities . </s>
<s> Even some lawyers who have used consultants to their advantage see a need to limit their impact . </s>
<s> Mr. Boies , the first lawyer to use Mr. Vinson 's services , cautions against courts ' allowing extensive jury questioning -LRB- known as voir dire -RRB- or giving out personal information about the jurors . </s>
<s> `` The more extensive the voir dire , the easier you make it for that kind of research to be effective , and I do n't think courts should lend themselves to that , '' Mr. Boies says . </s>
