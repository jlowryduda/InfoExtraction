<s> After being whipsawed by a volatile stock market , Treasury bonds closed higher . </s>
<s> But junk bonds took more hits . </s>
<s> Early in the day , bond dealers said trading volume was heavy as large institutional investors scrambled to buy long-term Treasury bonds on speculation that the stock market 's volatility would lead to a `` flight-to-quality '' rally . </s>
<s> That happens when nervous stock investors dump equities and buy Treasurys , which are higher in quality and thus considered safe . </s>
<s> `` Some retail accounts , such as commercial banks and pension funds , wanted to get on the bandwagon before it was too late , '' said Sung Won Sohn , chief economist at Norwest Corp. , Minneapolis . </s>
<s> At one point , the Dow Jones Industrial average fell about 80 points on news that UAL Corp. decided to remain independent . </s>
<s> In response , Treasury prices soared 1 1\/8 points , or about $ 11.25 for each $ 1,000 face amount . </s>
<s> But the gains in Treasury bonds were pared as stocks staged a partial recovery . </s>
<s> The industrial average ended at 2659.22 , down 3.69 points . </s>
<s> Economists said the bond market 's strength also is a sign that investors expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates amid growing evidence that the economy is slowing . </s>
<s> While they do n't expect the Fed to move right away , they say the case for lower rates is building . </s>
<s> Yesterday , for example , the Commerce Department reported that new orders for durable goods fell 0.1 % , while the nation 's auto makers reported lackluster mid-October sales . </s>
<s> The Treasury 's 30-year bond ended over 1\/4 point higher . </s>
<s> Municipal , mortgage-backed and investment-grade corporate bonds rose 1\/8 to 1\/2 point . </s>
<s> But high-yield , high-risk bonds fell 1\/4 to 1\/2 point with the stock market early in the session and never recovered . </s>
<s> According to a trader at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , the hardest hit junk bonds were those issued by RJR Holdings Capital Corp. , which are the easiest to sell . </s>
<s> RJR 's 14.70 % bonds due 2007 fell 2 1\/2 points . </s>
<s> Trading activity in the junk market was extremely light as dealers could n't find enough buyers to match sellers . </s>
<s> `` While the stock market was falling , most -LCB- junk bond holders -RCB- were just watching it not knowing what to do , '' said Paul Suckow , director of fixed-income securities at Oppenheimer Management Corp . </s>
<s> `` It was like driving down the highway watching a wreck . </s>
<s> Everybody was rubber-necking . '' </s>
<s> Adding to the junk market 's jitters were reports that Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. is having trouble structuring a $ 1.6 billion offering for TW Food Services Inc. and will postpone or even cancel the issue . </s>
<s> TW is the largest franchisee of Hardee 's , a fast-food restaurant , and operates several other food chains . </s>
<s> Donaldson Lufkin would n't comment . </s>
<s> Credit analysts said investors are nervous about the issue because they say the company 's ability to meet debt payments is dependent on too many variables , including the sale of assets and the need to mortgage property to retire some existing debt . </s>
<s> Also , the TW offering includes interest-deferred and pay-in-kind securities , which are currently unpopular . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , investors turned a cold shoulder to the Treasury 's sale of $ 10 billion of new two-year notes yesterday . </s>
<s> `` It 's not too surprising that the auction was sloppy , given the volatility in the bond market because of stocks , '' said Robert T. McGee , a senior vice president at Tokai Bank Ltd . </s>
<s> `` People are looking past supply to lower interest rates , but they 're also worried about being whipsawed by the volatility in the stock market . '' </s>
<s> The new two-year notes were priced with an average yield of 7.74 % . </s>
<s> That was higher than the 7.71 % to 7.73 % average yield that traders had expected . </s>
<s> In when-issued trading , the notes were quoted at a price to yield 7.78 % . </s>
<s> Sluggish demand was also evidenced by the weak 2.41-to-1 bid-to-cover ratio , which was lower than the average 2.79-to-1 ratio at the last 12 similar auctions . </s>
<s> The ratio , which reflects the number of bids the Treasury receives for each bid accepted , is used to gauge investor demand . </s>
<s> Dealers said players shied away from the note sale because they were concerned that prices at the time of the auction might erode if the stock market staged a recovery , which , in fact , did happen . </s>
<s> Individual and Japanese participation in the auction was disappointing , according to dealers . </s>
<s> `` Interest by Japanese investors was limited , '' said Michael Moran , chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc . </s>
<s> `` They are typically not active in two-year note auctions , but today 's participation could be viewed as lighter-than-normal . '' </s>
<s> However , Mr. Moran added that the Japanese generally have a positive view of the U.S. bond market because of expectations that the dollar will remain strong and interest rates will decline . </s>
<s> He said , `` Possibly , they 're waiting to buy at the -LRB- quarterly -RRB- refunding '' of government debt to be held next month by the Treasury . </s>
<s> A trader at a Japanese firm estimated that the Japanese purchased no more than 10 % of the two-year notes . </s>
<s> Treasury , Agency Securities </s>
<s> Today investors will focus on the long-awaited auction of $ 4.5 billion of 30-year bonds by Resolution Funding Corp . </s>
<s> The initial bond offering by the new government agency , which was created to help rescue the nation 's troubled thrifts , is n't expected to see robust demand . </s>
<s> A small yield premium over comparable Treasurys and a lack of liquidity is hampering dealers ' efforts to drum up interest in the so-called bailout bonds . </s>
<s> In when-issued trading , the Refcorp bonds were quoted at a price to yield 8.17 % . </s>
<s> Yesterday , the benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at 102 18\/32 to yield 7.89 % , compared with 102 9\/32 to yield 7.93 % on Monday . </s>
<s> The latest 10-year Treasury was quoted at 100 22\/32 to yield 7.88 % , compared with 100 17\/32 to yield 7.9 % . </s>
<s> Short-term rates were unchanged to slightly lower . </s>
<s> The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills was quoted at 7.52 % for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.75 % , while the rate on six-month Treasury bills was quoted at 7.47 % for a yield of 7.85 % . </s>
<s> Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value . </s>
<s> Thus , higher bidding narrows the investor 's return while lower bidding widens it . </s>
<s> Corporate Issues </s>
<s> Several blue-chip companies tapped the new-issue market yesterday to take advantage of falling interest rates . </s>
<s> Three of the largest offerings , by Exxon Capital Corp. , Xerox Corp. and Citicorp , were underwritten by groups led by Salomon Brothers Inc . </s>
<s> Exxon Capital , long-rumored to be a potential debt issuer , offered $ 200 million of 10-year notes priced to yield 8.31 % . </s>
<s> Citicorp issued $ 200 million of seven-year notes priced to yield 8.82 % , and Xerox priced $ 150 million of six-year notes to yield 8.85 % . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , International Business Machines Corp. paved the way for a visit to the credit markets by filing a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission for $ 800 million in new debt . </s>
<s> This is in addition to IBM 's existing shelf registration under which $ 200 million in debt securities are available for issuance . </s>
<s> In secondary trading , investment-grade corporate bonds ended 1\/8 to 1\/4 higher . </s>
<s> Municipals </s>
<s> Actively traded municipal bonds ended 1\/4 to 1\/2 point higher in brisk trading , despite a flood of new supply . </s>
<s> New Jersey Turnpike Authority 's 7.20 % issue of 2018 finished 1\/4 point stronger at 98 1\/2 bid , to yield 7.32 % . </s>
<s> Traders said municipals were underpinned by influences including the climb in Treasury issue prices . </s>
<s> Also , municipal bonds lured buying because the stock market remains wobbly , traders contended . </s>
<s> Mainly , though , it was a favorable outlook for yesterday 's new supply that propped up municipals , some traders said . </s>
<s> Among the new issues was Massachusetts 's $ 230 million of general obligation bonds . </s>
<s> The bonds were won by a Goldman , Sachs & Co. group with a true interest cost of 7.17 % . </s>
<s> They were priced to yield from 6.00 % in 1990 to 7.20 % in 2009 . </s>
<s> The Massachusetts deal had an unsold balance of $ 84.3 million in late trading , the underwriter said . </s>
<s> Mortgage - , Asset-Backed Securities </s>
<s> Mortgage securities gained 3\/32 to 9\/32 point after a hectic session , with Government National Mortgage Association 8 % securities as the standout issue . </s>
<s> The Ginnie Mae issue rose amid talk of large purchases of the securities by institutional investors . </s>
<s> The derivative markets remained active as one new issue was priced and talk circulated about more offerings in the next day or two . </s>
<s> The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. issued a $ 500 million real estate mortgage investment conduit backed by its 8 1\/2 % securities . </s>
<s> In the asset-backed market , a big offering of Ford Motor Credit Corp . auto-loan securities was increased in size after strong institutional demand . </s>
<s> The deal by the Ford Motor Co. unit , priced Monday , was increased to $ 3.05 billion from $ 2.58 billion . </s>
<s> Among major pass-through issues , Ginnie Mae 9 % securities for November delivery ended at 98 15\/32 , up 5\/32 , after touching an early high of 98 27\/32 ; 8 % securities were at 94 5\/32 , up 9\/32 ; 9 1\/2 % securities at 100 15\/32 , up 4\/32 ; and 10 % securities at 102 11\/32 , up 3\/32 . </s>
<s> Freddie Mac 9 % securities were at 97 21\/32 , up 5\/32 . </s>
<s> The Ginnie Mae 9 % issue was yielding 9.34 % to a 12-year average life assumption , as the spread above the Treasury 10-year note held at 1.46 percentage points . </s>
<s> Foreign Bonds </s>
<s> The Eurodollar bond market sprang to life late in the European trading session after the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled . </s>
<s> Eurodollar bonds are often issued by foreign corporations , but interest and principal are paid in dollars . </s>
<s> The bonds ended about 1\/2 point higher yesterday . </s>
<s> Prices of European government bonds also rose as U.S. stocks declined . </s>
<s> West Germany 's 7 % issue due October 1999 rose 0.13 point to 99.93 to yield 7.01 % , while the 6 3\/4 % issue due July 1994 rose 0.05 to 97.70 to yield 7.33 % . </s>
<s> Britain 's 11 3\/4 % Treasury bond due 2003\/2007 rose 17\/32 to 112 6\/32 to yield 10.05 % , while the 12 % notes due 1995 rose 11\/32 to 104 2\/32 to yield 10.93 % . </s>
