<s> Carnival Cruise Lines Inc. 's common stock was dragged down yesterday amid concerns that a bankruptcy filing by a Finnish shipbuilder would delay delivery of three big cruise ships . </s>
<s> The Miami-based company 's stock fell $ 1.75 yesterday to $ 20.75 a share in heavy American Stock Exchange composite trading . </s>
<s> Early yesterday , Carnival said in a company statement that it had been `` notified unofficially '' that Waertsilae Marine Industries , the Finnish shipyard that is building its three new cruise ships , planned to file for bankruptcy . </s>
<s> Officials at Carnival declined to comment . </s>
<s> `` There is just a tremendous amount of uncertainty about what the effect , if any , of all this is , '' said John P. Uphoff , an analyst at Raymond James Associates Inc . </s>
<s> `` I did n't even know that a company in a socialistic country could file for bankruptcy . '' </s>
<s> Carnival said the `` Fantasy , '' the first of the three $ 200 million ships that Carnival has on order , is scheduled to be delivered next month , just in time for the winter tourist season in the Caribbean . </s>
<s> That ship , which would carry about 2,050 passengers , would expand the capacity of Carnival 's existing 14-ship fleet by 24 % . </s>
<s> The second ship , which is half-completed , is scheduled to be delivered in fall 1990 , and the third in fall 1991 . </s>
<s> `` There 's a 99 % chance that the Fantasy will be delivered close to schedule , '' said Caroline Levy , an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc . </s>
<s> `` The others will probably be delivered as well , but Carnival will likely have to pay a higher price for them . '' </s>
<s> She said the company could pay as much as 25 % more for the ships . </s>
<s> If the ships are n't delivered , however , it will likely have an effect on the company 's earnings as soon as the 1990 fiscal year , which begins Dec. 1 . </s>
<s> Analysts said those estimates -- which range from about $ 1.80 a share to $ 1.95 a share -- are based on Fantasy being in operation in 1990 . </s>
<s> If the ship fails to arrive , those per-share earnings estimates could be trimmed 15 cents or more . </s>
<s> Analysts were n't willing to speculate on how much money Carnival might lose through deposits . </s>
<s> Normally , a company pays a portion of the total cost of a ship as it reaches various stages of construction . </s>
<s> Carnival , for example , has already paid about $ 160 million of the total cost for Fantasy . </s>
<s> Some analysts say this may give it the right to seize the ship if the situation warrants it . </s>
<s> According to reports from Finland , Waertsilae Marine , 19%-owned by conglomerate Oy Waertsilae , filed for bankruptcy yesterday after the shipyard 's contractors had started to demand bank guarantees . </s>
<s> The shipyard disclosed in mid-August that it expected losses stemming from a series of unprofitable orders . </s>
