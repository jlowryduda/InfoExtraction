<s> A # 320 million -LRB- $ 508 million -RRB- British Airways PLC rights issue flopped badly -- the victim of recent market turbulence and the collapse of the buy-out bid for United Airlines ' parent , UAL Corp . </s>
<s> The United Kingdom carrier had planned the issue to help finance its $ 750 million purchase of a 15 % stake in UAL . </s>
<s> But British Airways withdrew from the UAL labor-management buy-out plan last Friday , after the group failed to get bank financing for its $ 6.79 billion buy-out . </s>
<s> British Airways said its shareholders accepted only 6.3 % of the convertible capital bonds , but that the rest of the issue will be taken up by underwriters . </s>
<s> Analysts said that 6.3 % level marked the poorest showing for any major British rights issue since the 1987 global stock market crash . </s>
<s> `` It is close to being a record undersubscription , '' said Bob Bucknell , an analyst with London broker Smith New Court Securities . </s>
<s> `` Fund managers do n't like to have rights issues that do n't have an obvious reason . </s>
<s> The obvious reason was -LRB- for British Air -RRB- to buy a stake in United Airlines . '' </s>
<s> In a statement , British Air Chairman Lord King said the company was `` obviously disappointed that the issue was not taken up , but it would have been unreasonable to expect a better result given the volatility of the stock market since the launch of the issue . '' </s>
<s> But except for the embarrassment , British Air will emerge relatively unscathed from the flopped issue . </s>
<s> Underwriters led by Lazard Brothers & Co. will pick up the rest of the airline 's offer of four convertible capital bonds for every nine common shares . </s>
<s> Lazard and other primary underwriters have reduced or eliminated their exposure by sub-underwriting the issue among U.K. institutional investors . </s>
<s> `` The -LRB- paper -RRB- loss here is very small '' for these sub-underwriters , observed John Nelson , a Lazard managing director . </s>
<s> In any case , he added , `` most institutions probably wo n't sell '' the bonds . </s>
<s> And instead of buying the UAL stake , the U.K. carrier will be able to reduce its high debt level and build an acquisition war chest . </s>
<s> `` From a cash flow point of view , British Airways is better off not being in United Airlines in the short term , '' said Andy Chambers , an analyst at Nomura Research Institute in London . </s>
<s> Added another U.K. analyst : `` It gives them some cash in the back pocket for when they want to do something . '' </s>
<s> For instance , British Air is continuing to negotiate with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines about each acquiring a 20 % stake in Sabena World Airlines , the air transport subsidiary of the Belgian national airline . </s>
<s> A definitive agreement had been expected by the end of July . </s>
<s> The failed rights issue also should have a modest impact on British Air shares . </s>
<s> The airline 's share price already is far below the 210 pence -LRB- $ 3.33 -RRB- level seen after the company announced the rights issue in late September . </s>
<s> In late trading on London 's Stock Exchange yesterday , the shares were off three pence at 194 pence . </s>
<s> And because British Air is issuing convertible bonds rather than ordinary shares , the share price wo n't be directly hurt by any surplus left with underwriters after they try to sell the issue in the open market . </s>
<s> But British Air 's withdrawal from the UAL buy-out could have further repercussions . </s>
<s> Some analysts speculated yesterday that the move has set off a board room split , which may lead to the resignation of Sir Colin Marshall , the carrier 's chief executive officer . </s>
<s> `` The stories are rubbish , '' a British Air spokesman said . </s>
<s> `` There is no difference of opinion between -LRB- Chairman -RRB- Lord King and Sir Colin on any aspect of company policy . </s>
