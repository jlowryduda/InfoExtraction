<s> Ford Motor Co. intensified its battle with General Motors Corp. over Jaguar PLC by saying it is prepared to make a bid for all of the British auto maker when restrictions on its shareholding are lifted . </s>
<s> The statement was part of a Ford filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission . </s>
<s> Ford did n't say how much it might offer for Jaguar , or when . </s>
<s> The British government currently forbids any outside investor from holding more than 15 % of the company 's shares without permission until Dec. 31 , </s>
<s> But with its stake in Jaguar , which it raised yesterday to 11.95 % , Ford could convene a special Jaguar shareholders ' meeting and urge holders to vote to drop the restriction sooner . </s>
<s> A successful vote would put pressure on the British government to lift the restriction . </s>
<s> `` We have not made that decision '' to seek a Jaguar special shareholders ' meeting , said Martyn Watkins , a Ford spokesman in London . </s>
<s> He emphasized that the car maker only would bid for all of Jaguar under the right circumstances , and said `` those circumstances are n't right or possible at the moment . '' </s>
<s> Last month , Ford announced plans to acquire as much as 15 % of Jaguar . </s>
<s> Since then , Jaguar officials have confirmed that they are discussing an alliance with GM and said last week that they hoped to reach an agreement within a month . </s>
<s> Analysts have been expecting a GM-Jaguar pact that would give the U.S. car maker an eventual 30 % stake in the British company and create joint ventures that would produce an executive-model range of cars . </s>
<s> But the specter of Ford eventually launching a full-fledged bid could unravel the GM-Jaguar talks . </s>
<s> Jaguar seems to be losing interest in giving GM a minority stake , said one individual close to the talks , adding , `` It would n't surprise me if -LCB- Jaguar executives -RCB- want to wait and see what the color of that -LCB- Ford bid -RCB- is '' first . </s>
<s> He predicted Ford officials will meet with Jaguar executives in the next week to outline their proposed offer . </s>
<s> Sir John Egan , Jaguar 's chairman , so far has refused to meet with Ford officials , but he is believed to be willing to consider a specific bid proposal . </s>
<s> As for GM , its `` fallback position has to be a full bid itself , '' said Stephen Reitman , European auto-industry analyst at London brokers UBS-Phillips & Drew . </s>
<s> A Ford takeover of Jaguar would `` have such implications for the balance of power in the 1990s that General Motors ca n't afford to step aside . </s>
<s> They will have to throw their hat in the ring . '' </s>
<s> A GM spokesman yesterday reiterated the company 's interest in acquiring a minority stake to help Jaguar remain independent . </s>
<s> A pitched battle could mean Jaguar would fetch # 10 -LRB- $ 16.02 -RRB- a share , or about # 1.8 billion -LRB- $ 2.88 billion -RRB- , several analysts believe . </s>
<s> The prospect of such a takeover fight has sent Jaguar shares soaring in recent weeks . </s>
<s> U.S. takeover-stock speculators now own an estimated 25 % of Jaguar shares . </s>
<s> In a declining London stock market yesterday , Jaguar shares were down four pence from Monday in late trading , at 694 pence -LRB- $ 11.11 -RRB- a share . </s>
<s> In the U.S. , Jaguar 's American depositary receipts rose 12.5 cents in over-the-counter trading , to $ 11.25 . </s>
<s> Both Ford and GM badly need a luxury brand to combat new competition from the Japanese in the European and U.S. markets . </s>
<s> And financially strapped Jaguar has spent over a year looking for a rich uncle to provide cash and technological know-how . </s>
<s> The company has expressed a preference for GM over Ford because GM has promised it would keep Jaguar independent . </s>
<s> Ford 's need to acquire some or all of Jaguar became more acute last week when it abandoned a four-year effort to market its German-built Merkur Scorpio sedan as a European luxury import in the U.S. . </s>
<s> Then , last Friday , Ford 's talks about a possible alliance with Saab-Scania AB of Sweden collapsed . </s>
<s> GM 's interest in Jaguar reflects a desire to help diversify the U.S. company 's products in the growing luxury-car segment of the market . </s>
<s> Its Opel line has a solid image and a recent string of highly successful new models , but it lacks Jaguar 's cachet . </s>
<s> GM officials also see a lot of potential in marrying Jaguar 's cars to the technological know-how of Group Lotus PLC , a British engineering and specialty car maker GM bought in 1986 . </s>
