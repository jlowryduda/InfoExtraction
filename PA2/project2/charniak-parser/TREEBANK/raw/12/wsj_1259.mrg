<s> The Wall Street Journal `` American Way of Buying '' Survey consists of two separate , door-to-door nationwide polls conducted for the Journal by Peter D. Hart Research Associates and the Roper Organization . </s>
<s> The two surveys , which asked different questions , were conducted using national random probability samples . </s>
<s> The poll conducted by Peter D. Hart Research Associates interviewed 2,064 adults age 18 and older from June 15 to June 30 , 1989 . </s>
<s> The poll conducted by the Roper Organization interviewed 2,002 adults age 18 and older from July 7 to July 15 , 1989 . </s>
<s> Responses were weighted on the basis of age and gender to conform with U.S. Census data . </s>
<s> For each poll , the odds are 19 out of 20 that if pollsters had sought to survey every household in the U.S. using the same questionnaire , the findings would differ from these poll results by no more than 2 1\/2 percentage points in either direction . </s>
<s> The margin of error for subgroups -- for example , married women with children at home -- would be larger . </s>
<s> In addition , in any survey , there is always the chance that other factors such as question wording could introduce errors into the findings . </s>
