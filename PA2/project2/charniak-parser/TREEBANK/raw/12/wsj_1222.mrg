<s> Residents of this city soon will be seeing ads urging them to visit `` Cleveland 's outdoor museum '' -- Lake View Cemetery . </s>
<s> Despite such famous tenants as oil magnate John D. Rockefeller , Lake View Cemetery has fallen on hard times . </s>
<s> So the inner-city burial ground is trying to resurrect itself with a television advertising campaign . </s>
<s> The ads celebrate the achievements of some of Lake View 's residents . </s>
<s> A spot honoring Bill White , the inventor of chewing gum , shows a woman trying to extricate her high-heeled shoe from a wad of gum . </s>
<s> Another focuses on Charles Brush , the first person to light a city electrically . </s>
<s> It shows a boy hurling rocks at a street lamp . </s>
<s> Street lights , the ad points out , `` helped sharpen the arm of many a budding baseball player . '' </s>
<s> Cemetery officials hope the ads , which will begin airing next month , will not only draw visitors but bolster burials and endowment fund contributions . </s>
<s> Lake View had an operating deficit last year and has a poor reputation as an out-of-repair and crime-infested cemetery . </s>
<s> The private , non-profit cemetery has had trouble competing against its for-profit counterparts , which use direct mail and other advertising to sell lots . </s>
<s> `` We do n't want to be known as ambulance chasers , '' says William Garrison , Lake View 's president . </s>
<s> `` We want people to think of Lake View as an historical park and educational experience ... . </s>
<s> A pleasant place to come and spend a few hours . '' </s>
<s> Not all of the cemetery 's better-known tenants lend themselves to the promotional job at hand , however . </s>
<s> For example , President James A. Garfield is entombed here , the victim of an assassination in 1881 . </s>
<s> -LRB- Mr. Garrison notes , however , that the Garfield tomb is one of the nation 's premier examples of Romanesque architecture . -RRB- </s>
<s> Mr. Rockefeller , buried beneath a 180-foot-tall granite obelisk , did n't seem right for an ad either . </s>
<s> The oil magnate , who spent his later years passing out dimes to counter his penny-pinching image , `` is n't terribly amusing , '' says Barry Olson , creative director at Innis-Maggiore-Olson , Canton , Ohio , which is producing the ads . </s>
<s> But there are plenty of other promising prospects at Lake View , promoters believe : Ernest Ball , for instance , who wrote `` When Irish Eyes are Smiling , '' and Garrett Morgan , the inventor of the gas mask and the tri-colored traffic light . </s>
