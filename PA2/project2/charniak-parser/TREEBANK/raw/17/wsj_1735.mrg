<s> H&R Block is one of the great success stories of U.S. business . </s>
<s> Oddly enough , this presents a problem for the stock . </s>
<s> Some money managers are disenchanted with H&R Block because they suspect the company 's glory days are past , or at least passing . </s>
<s> Block 's tax-preparation business is mature , they say , and some of its diversifications are facing tough competition . </s>
<s> It 's no secret that Block dominates the mass-market tax-preparation business . </s>
<s> The Street knows all about the predictability of its earnings , which are headed for a ninth consecutive yearly increase . </s>
<s> The company has consistently earned more than a 20 % annual return on its net worth while many companies would be happy with 15 % . </s>
<s> But the tax-preparation business simply has no more room to grow , says Mark Cremonie , director of research for Capital Supervisors Inc. , a Chicago firm that manages $ 6.5 billion . </s>
<s> `` You go to any medium-sized town in the U.S. and you 're going to see H&R Block tax services . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Cremonie 's firm once held about 4.8 % of H&R Block . </s>
<s> That was before the 1986 tax `` reform '' made taxes more complex than ever . </s>
<s> `` One thing you can bet on , '' he says , `` is that Congress will do stupid things with the Tax Code . '' </s>
<s> But Capital Supervisors sold the last of its H&R Block holdings earlier this year . </s>
<s> `` They 're thrashing around for diversification , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` I think a lot of their businesses are just so-so . '' </s>
<s> Last week the stock hit an all-time high of 37 1\/4 before getting roughed up in the Friday-the-13th minicrash . </s>
<s> It closed yesterday at 34 3\/4 . </s>
<s> To be sure , the stock still has a lot of fans . </s>
<s> `` If you invested $ 10,000 in the initial public offering in 1962 , it would be worth well over $ 5 million today , '' says Fredric E. Russell , a Tulsa , Okla. , money manager . </s>
<s> `` I do n't know what the risk is -LCB- of holding the stock -RCB- . </s>
<s> Taxes are not going out of business . '' </s>
<s> Many of his peers feel the same way . </s>
<s> The number of big institutions that own H&R Block shares is 207 and growing , according to a midyear tally by CDA Investment Technologies . </s>
<s> Brokerage houses are sweet on H&R Block , too . </s>
<s> Zacks Investment Research counts five brokerage houses that consider the stock a buy , and four that call it a hold . </s>
<s> None dare say to sell it . </s>
<s> But some money managers are doing just that . </s>
<s> Eugene Sit , president of Sit Investment Associates in Minneapolis , says , `` When we bought it , we thought the growth rate was going to accelerate '' because of computerized tax filing and instant refunds -LRB- the customer gets a refund immediately but pays extra to the tax preparer , which waits for Uncle Sam 's check -RRB- . </s>
<s> But neither of those developments did much to juice up growth , Mr. Sit says . </s>
<s> He figures Block earnings are now growing at about a 10 % annual rate -LRB- down from about 14 % the past five years -RRB- and will grow at an 8%-10 % rate in the future . </s>
<s> That 's `` not bad , '' Mr. Sit says , but it sure does n't justify Block shares being priced at 15 to 16 times estimated earnings for fiscal 1990 . </s>
<s> He wants stocks whose price\/earnings ratio is less than their growth rate ; as he figures it , H&R Block does n't even come close . </s>
<s> Two other money managers , in explaining why they have sold large amounts of H&R Block stock this year , spoke on the condition they not be named . </s>
<s> `` The stock was going no place and the earnings were so-so , '' said one . </s>
<s> -LRB- In the past two years , the stock almost stalled out . </s>
<s> It was above 33 , adjusted for a subsequent split , in 1987 , and has n't gotten much higher since . -RRB- </s>
<s> `` There 's no more growth in the tax business -LCB- except -RCB- for increasing prices , '' the money manager added . </s>
<s> The CompuServe subsidiary -LRB- which provides information to home-computer users -RRB- is `` where the growth is , '' he said , but its format is `` still too complicated . '' </s>
<s> CompuServe provides about 20 % of both sales and earnings . </s>
<s> The tax business still provides about 70 % of earnings , on about 50 % of sales . </s>
<s> Personnel Pool -LRB- temporary workers , mostly in the health-care area -RRB- chips in close to 25 % of sales but only about 9 % of earnings . </s>
<s> The shortage of nurses is crimping profit at Personnel Pool , said the second money manager . </s>
<s> He concedes H&R Block is `` well-entrenched '' and `` a great company , '' but says `` it does n't grow fast enough for us . </s>
<s> We 're looking for something that grows faster and sells at a comparable -LCB- price-earnings -RCB- multiple . '' </s>
<s> Thomas M. Bloch , president and chief operating officer , says `` I would disagree '' that the tax business is mature . </s>
<s> For example , he says , the company is planning to go nationwide with a new service , tested in parts of the country , aimed at taxpayers who want refunds in a hurry . </s>
<s> Mr. Bloch concedes that a recent diversification attempt fell through . </s>
<s> `` We 're still interested -LCB- in diversifying -RCB- , '' he says , `` but we 'd rather be prudent than make a mistake . '' </s>
<s> He also says CompuServe 's earnings continue to grow `` 20 % to 30 % a year '' in spite of tough competition from giants like Sears and IBM . </s>
<s> And he says Block 's other businesses are growing , although less consistently . </s>
