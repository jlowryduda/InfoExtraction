<s> BankAmerica Corp. reported a 34 % jump in third-quarter earnings , as its rocket-like recovery from nearly ruinous losses several years ago continued to be fueled by growth in consumer loans , higher interest margins and negligible loan losses . </s>
<s> For the quarter , BankAmerica said it earned $ 254 million , or $ 1.16 a share , compared with $ 190 million , or 97 cents a share , a year earlier . </s>
<s> BankAmerica spokesmen said preliminary reports indicate the company was n't materially affected by the Tuesday earthquake . </s>
<s> All but eight of the 850 branches , which had some structural damage , reopened yesterday for business . </s>
<s> Automated teller machine operations also were up and operating yesterday , a bank spokesman said . </s>
<s> For the first time in nearly two years , BankAmerica results failed to improve in consecutive quarters , but the decline from the second quarter was attributable to special factors . </s>
<s> Third-quarter profit was 16 % below the $ 304 million , or $ 1.50 a share , earned in the 1989 second quarter . </s>
<s> The company cited higher tax credits in the second quarter , totaling $ 63 million , compared with $ 28 million in the third quarter . </s>
<s> Excluding tax credits , profit was 6 % below the second quarter . </s>
<s> But that drop was caused entirely by a decline in Brazilian interest paid , to $ 5 million from $ 54 million the second quarter . </s>
<s> Moreover , BankAmerica continued to build its reserve against troubled foreign loans by boosting its loan-loss provision to $ 170 million , about the same as the previous quarter but well above the $ 100 million in the year-earlier quarter . </s>
<s> The provision rate was far above BankAmerica 's actual net credit losses of $ 24 million in the third quarter , compared with $ 18 million in the second period and $ 38 million a year earlier . </s>
<s> As a result , BankAmerica said its reserve against troubled foreign-country loans , once below 25 % , now amounts to 45 % of the $ 6.4 billion of non-trade debt it calculates it is owed by those nations . </s>
<s> That level is about the same as some other big banks , but far below the 85 % and 100 % reserves of Bankers Trust New York Corp. and J.P. Morgan & Co. , respectively . </s>
<s> By any measure , third-quarter earnings were still robust , equivalent to a 0.92 % return on assets even excluding tax credits . </s>
<s> By that key measure of operating efficiency , BankAmerica turned in a better performance than its well-regarded Los Angeles-based competitor , Security Pacific Corp. , which posted a 0.89 % return in the third quarter . </s>
<s> But it continued to badly trail its San Francisco neighbor , Wells Fargo & Co. , which reported an extraordinary 1.25 % return on assets . </s>
<s> Both returns do n't include any tax credits . </s>
<s> `` They -LCB- BankAmerica -RCB- continue to show good performance , '' said Donald K. Crowley , an analyst with Keefe , Bruyette & Woods Inc. , San Francisco . </s>
<s> In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange , BankAmerica common stock edged up 12.5 cents to close at $ 32 a share . </s>
<s> Shareholder equity improved to 4.68 % from 4.23 % in the previous quarter . </s>
<s> The 4.52 % net interest margin , or the difference between the yield on a bank 's investments and the rate it pays for deposits and other borrowings , was still markedly higher than the 3.91 % ratio a year earlier , and is among the best in the industry , analysts said . </s>
<s> The high margin partly stems from continued strong growth in high-yielding consumer loans , which jumped 31 % to $ 17.47 billion from a year earlier , and residential mortgages , which rose 25 % to $ 12 billion . </s>
<s> BankAmerica 's total loans rose 8 % to $ 71.36 billion . </s>
<s> For the nine months , BankAmerica profit soared 81 % to $ 833 million , or $ 4.07 a share , from $ 461 million , or $ 2.40 a share . </s>
