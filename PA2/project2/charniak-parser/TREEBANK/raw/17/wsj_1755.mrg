<s> Where do Americans put their money ? </s>
<s> It depends on when you look . </s>
<s> In 1900 , for instance , less than 8 % of assets went into bank deposits . </s>
<s> That rose to nearly 18 % during the Depression , and has n't changed much since . </s>
<s> Pension reserves , on the other hand , made up a relatively small part of household assets until the last decade , when they skyrocketed . </s>
<s> And there has been a drastic decline in the importance of unincorporated business assets -- thanks to industry consolidation and a decline in family farms . </s>
<s> That 's some of what emerges from the following charts , which show how Americans have changed their investment patterns over the past 90 years . </s>
<s> Some results are self-explanatory . </s>
<s> But other figures are surprising . </s>
<s> Housing , for instance , has remained a fairly steady component of household assets over the past decade -- although common wisdom would have expected an increase . </s>
<s> `` There is a lot of attention paid to housing as a form of household wealth , '' says Edward N. Wolff , professor of economics at New York University . </s>
<s> `` But it has n't increased much relative to other assets . </s>
<s> It suggests that households accumulate wealth across a broad spectrum of assets . </s>
<s> And housing though it appears in the popular mind as being the major -LCB- growing -RCB- household asset , is n't . '' </s>
<s> In addition , investors ' desire to hold stocks -- directly and through mutual funds -- has held surprisingly steady ; stocks ' importance among assets largely reflects the ups and downs of the stock market , and not a shift in stock-holding preferences . </s>
<s> `` Stocks have not spread to the general public , despite the fact that the environment is much different , '' concludes Robert Avery , an economist at Cornell University . </s>
<s> `` To me it says that despite all the views that we spend too much of our wealth on paper assets , we have ways of holding wealth similar to 100 years ago . '' </s>
<s> -- The charts show how househld assets have been distributed over time . </s>
<s> The main components of the various asseet categories : Housing : Primary home , but not the land it 's on . </s>
<s> Land and Other Real Estate : Land on which primary home is built , investment property . </s>
<s> Consumer Durables : Automobiles , appliances , furniture . </s>
<s> Bank Deposits : Currency , checking-account deposits , small savings and time deposits , certificates of deposits , money-market fund shares . </s>
<s> Bonds : Excludes bond funds . </s>
<s> Stocks\/Mutual Funds : Stocks and mutual funds other than money-market funds . </s>
<s> Unincorporated Business : Partnerships and sole proprietorships , professional corporations . </s>
<s> Pension Reserves : Holdings by pension funds . </s>
