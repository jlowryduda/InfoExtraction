<s> Slowing sales of its profitable Jeep Cherokee and Wagoneer sport utility vehicles are forcing Chrysler Corp. to temporarily idle its Toledo , Ohio , assembly plant for the first time since April 1986 . </s>
<s> About 5,500 hourly workers will be laid off for a week beginning Oct. 23 , and overtime has been eliminated at the plant for the fourth quarter , a Chrysler spokesman said . </s>
<s> That 's a significant change from earlier this year when the plant worked substantial overtime only to have sales fall short of the company 's bullish expectations . </s>
<s> Sales of Cherokee , the best-selling Jeep , and the lower-volume Wagoneer were actually up about 10 % through the end of last month . </s>
<s> But that 's less than Chrysler officials had hoped when they set ambitious production schedules for the Toledo plant earlier this year . </s>
<s> Even when it became clear this spring that demand was n't coming up to expectations , Chrysler officials `` resisted '' cutting output because Cherokee and Wagoneer are `` very profitable vehicles , '' the spokesman said . </s>
<s> Instead , Chrysler officials in late May slapped $ 1,000 cash rebates on the vehicles , including the first such incentives on the popular four-door Cherokee since Chrysler bought Jeep in 1987 . </s>
<s> The incentives boosted sales for a while , but the pace had cooled by last month . </s>
<s> The result : Chrysler dealers had a bloated 82-day supply of the Cherokee as of the end of last month and a 161-day supply of the Comanche pickup , which Toledo also builds . </s>
<s> A 60-day to 65-day supply is considered normal . </s>
<s> At Jasper Jeep-Eagle , one of the largest Jeep dealerships in the country , inventories have continued to swell . </s>
<s> Steve Lowe , general manager of Jasper , Ga. , dealership , said new rebates of $ 500 to $ 1,000 on the models have stimulated sales , but not enough to significantly cut dealer stocks . </s>
<s> `` If people are n't buying , you have to close plants , '' he said . </s>
<s> Separately , Chrysler said it will idle for four weeks the St. Louis assembly plant that builds the Chrysler LeBaron and Dodge Daytona models . </s>
<s> Chrysler officials said the plant is scheduled to resume production on Nov. 20. , and 3,300 hourly workers will be affected . </s>
<s> General Motors Corp. , meanwhile , said it will idle for yet another week its Linden , N.J. , assembly plant , bringing to three weeks the total time that plant will be idled during October . </s>
<s> GM said the assembly plant , which builds the Chevrolet Corsica and Beretta compact cars , originally was scheduled to reopen Monday but now will not resume production until Oct. 30 . </s>
<s> The shutdown affects 3,000 workers and will cut output by about 4,320 cars . </s>
<s> Sluggish sales of the Beretta and Corsica spurred GM to offer $ 800 rebates on those cars . </s>
<s> The Corsica and Beretta make up the highest-volume car line at Chevrolet , but sales of the cars are off 9.6 % for the year , and fell a steep 34.2 % early this month . </s>
<s> GM has scheduled overtime at its Lordstown , Ohio , and Janesville , Wis. , assembly plants , which build the Chevrolet Cavalier . </s>
<s> Ford Motor Co. said it will shut down for one week its Kentucky Truck Plant because of a `` shortage of dealer orders . '' </s>
<s> The shutdown will idle 2,000 hourly employees and eliminate production of about 1,300 medium and heavy duty trucks . </s>
<s> The assembly plant is scheduled to resume production on Oct. 30 . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , the nine major U.S. auto makers plan to build 143,178 cars this week , down 11.7 % from 162,190 a year ago and flat with last week 's 142,117 car output . </s>

<s> r - Revised . </s>
<s> x - Year-to-date 1988 figure includes Volkswagen domestic-production through July . </s>
