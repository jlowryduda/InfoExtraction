<s> Corporate efforts to control health-care costs by requiring evaluations prior to planned hospitalization and surgery have n't been sweeping enough to reduce the long-term rate of cost increases , according to a study by the Institute of Medicine . </s>
<s> In the last decade , many corporations have embraced the `` utilization management '' cost containment strategy as a way to control health-care costs for employees . </s>
<s> These programs vary widely , but often require second opinions on proposed surgery , preadmission reviews of elective hospitalizations and reviews of treatment during illnesses or recovery periods . </s>
<s> Between 50 % and 75 % of today 's workers are covered by such plans , up from 5 % five years ago . </s>
<s> `` Although it probably has reduced the level of expenditures for some purchasers , utilization management -- like most other cost containment strategies -- does n't appear to have altered the long-term rate of increase in health-care costs , '' the Institute of Medicine , an affiliate of the National Academy of Sciences , concluded after a two-year study . </s>
<s> `` Employers who saw a short-term moderation in benefit expenditures are seeing a return to previous trends . '' </s>
<s> While utilization management frequently reduces hospitalization costs , these savings are often offset by increases in outpatient services and higher administrative costs , according to the report by a panel of health-care experts . </s>
<s> The report suggested that current review programs are too narrow . </s>
<s> `` The unnecessary and inappropriate use of the hospital , and not the actual need for a particular procedure , has been the main focus , '' the panel said . </s>
<s> `` As a general rule , prior-review programs have not made case-by-case assessments of the comparative costs of alternative treatments or sites of care . '' </s>
<s> The report said that utilization management should have more of an impact as federal research on the effectiveness of medical treatments helps lead to medical practice guidelines . </s>
<s> Howard Bailit , a panel member and a vice president of Aetna Life & Casualty , said that utilization management will also do a better job of containing costs as it spreads to cover medical services delivered outside of hospitals . </s>
<s> `` There 's pretty good evidence that utilization management has reduced inappropriate hospitalization , '' he said . </s>
<s> But at the same time , spending on physician services and ambulatory care have mushroomed . </s>
<s> `` It 's like squeezing a balloon , '' Dr. Bailit said . </s>
<s> David Rahill of A. Foster Higgins & Co. said that clients of his consulting firm report that utilization management reduces their hospital care bills by about 5 % , but he agreed that for the health-care system as whole , some of these savings are offset by administrative and outpatient care costs . </s>
<s> Jerome Grossman , chairman of the panel , agrees that administrative costs of utilization management programs can be high . </s>
<s> `` You have a whole staff standing ready '' to evaluate the appropriateness of recommended treatment , he said . </s>
<s> Dr. Grossman , who also is president of New England Medical Center Hospitals in Boston , noted that the hospitals he runs deal with more than 100 utilization management firms and that many of them have different procedures and requirements . </s>
<s> The panel urged greater efforts to reduce the complexity , paperwork and cost of utilization review . </s>
<s> `` Utilization management needs to better demonstrate that it reduces the wasteful use of resources , improves the appropriateness of patient care and imposes only reasonable burdens on patients and providers , '' the panel concluded . </s>
