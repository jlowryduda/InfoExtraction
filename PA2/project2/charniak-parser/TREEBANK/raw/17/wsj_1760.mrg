<s> Outside the white-walled headquarters of the socalled Society of Orange Workers , all seems normal in South Africa 's abnormal society . </s>
<s> A pickup truck driven by a white farmer rumbles past with a load of black workers bouncing in the back . </s>
<s> Over at Conradies , the general store , a black stock boy scurries to help an elderly white woman with her packages . </s>
<s> Down the street , a car pulls into the Shell station and is surrounded by black attendants . </s>
<s> But inside the white walls of the Orange Workers ' office -- just about the largest building in town , save for the Dutch Reformed Church and the school -- South Africa 's neat racial order is awry . </s>
<s> A dozen white office workers fold newsletters and stuff them into envelopes . </s>
<s> White women serve tea and coffee , and then wash the cups and saucers afterwards . </s>
<s> White children empty the wastepaper baskets and squeegee the windows . </s>
<s> There is n't a black worker in sight . </s>
<s> Not in the kitchen , or the storeroom or the book shop . </s>
<s> `` If we want to have our own nation , then we must be willing to do all the work ourselves , '' says Hendrik Verwoerd Jr. , son of the former prime minister and the leader of the Orange Workers , founded in 1980 . </s>
<s> They do indeed want their own nation . </s>
<s> The pillars of apartheid may be trembling in the rest of South Africa , with Johannesburg opening its public facilities to all races , blacks storming the all-white beaches of the Cape and the government releasing seven leaders of the banned African National Congress . </s>
<s> But here in Morgenzon , a sleepy town amid the corn fields of the eastern Transvaal , the Orange Workers are holding the pillars steady . </s>
<s> The Orange Workers -- who take their name from William of Orange of the Netherlands , a hero of the Dutch-descended Afrikaners -- believe that the solution to South Africa 's racial problems is n't the abolition of apartheid , it 's the perfection of apartheid -- complete and total separation of the races . </s>
<s> Here , then , is where the Orange Workers have come to make apartheid 's last stand . </s>
<s> Their idea is to create a city , first , and then an entire nation -- without blacks . </s>
<s> This may seem to be a preposterous and utterly futile effort in Africa . </s>
<s> And the fact that there are only 3,000 card-carrying Orange Workers may put them on the loony fringe . </s>
<s> But their ideal of an Afrikaner homeland , an all-white reserve to be carved out of present-day South Africa , is a mainstream desire of the right-wing , which embraces about one-third of the country 's five million whites . </s>
<s> Afrikaner philosophers and theologians have long ruminated on the need for a white homeland . </s>
<s> The Orange Workers are just putting this preaching into practice . </s>
<s> Thus , farmer Johan Fischer , his T-shirt and jeans covered in grease , crawls around under his planter , tightening bolts and fixing dents . </s>
<s> On almost every other farm in South Africa , black workers do the repairs . </s>
<s> But not here . </s>
<s> Mr. Fischer plows his own fields , sows his own corn and sunflowers , and feeds his own sheep . </s>
<s> Over at the fiberglass factory , four white workers assemble water tanks on their own , and in their spare time they build townhouses across the road . </s>
<s> On Main Street , Alida Verwoerd and her daughters look after the clothes and fabric shop , then hurry home to fix lunch for the rest of the family . </s>
<s> Down by the stream , a group of Orange Workers puts the finishing touches on a golf course . </s>
<s> If whites want to play there by themselves , says consulting engineer Willem van Heerden , whites should also build it by themselves . </s>
<s> `` If we want to survive as a people , '' he says , `` we have to change our way of life . </s>
<s> The Afrikaner must end his reliance on others . '' </s>
<s> In their quest to perfect apartheid , the Orange Workers have discovered a truth that most of privileged white South Africa tries mightily to deny : The master ca n't become dependent on the slave and expect to remain master forever . </s>
<s> `` If apartheid means you want cheap black labor and all the comforts that go with it , but you also want to exclude the blacks from social and political integration , then these are two contradictions that ca n't go on forever , '' says Mr. Verwoerd . </s>
<s> He is sitting in his living room , beneath a huge portrait of his late father , Hendrik F. Verwoerd , apartheid 's architect and South African prime minister from 1958 to 1966 . </s>
<s> Somewhere , the son sighs , things went terribly wrong with apartheid ; today , whites even rely on blacks to police their separation . </s>
<s> `` People took separate development as an opportunity to use black labor without ever getting rid of it . </s>
<s> But my father meant it to mean real separation , '' says the son . </s>
<s> The Orange Workers speak sincerely . </s>
<s> `` We agree with world opinion that the status quo in South Africa is morally wrong , '' says Pieter Bruwer , the Orange Workers ' chief scribe and pamphleteer . </s>
<s> `` We must either integrate honestly or segregate honestly . '' </s>
<s> Morgenzon has long been a special domain of Afrikanerdom . </s>
<s> According to Mr. Verwoerd , the early Afrikaner pioneers were the first people to settle in the eastern Transvaal , even before the blacks . </s>
<s> Then , when Morgenzon was incorporated in 1908 , the farmer who owned the land stipulated that only whites could reside in town ; blacks could work there , but they had to leave at night . </s>
<s> Today , Morgenzon is a town of 800 whites and two paved roads . </s>
<s> Weeds push up through the cracks in the sidewalks , and many houses and storefronts are empty . </s>
<s> There are few factories and no mines . </s>
<s> It was an ideal place for the Orange Workers to start their new nation , unencumbered by the demographics that have undermined apartheid elsewhere in South Africa . </s>
<s> So far , about 150 Orange Workers have moved here , spending nearly $ 1 million buying up property over the past three years . </s>
<s> Still , complete and total segregation remains elusive . </s>
<s> Just beyond the city limits is a shantytown of 2,000 blacks who are employed throughout the area . </s>
<s> Despite the Orange Workers ' intention to put them all out of work , they are in no hurry to leave . </s>
<s> A young man called July -LRB- that 's when he was born -RRB- , who works at the railroad station just up the street from the Orange Workers office , points at the whitewalled building and says matter-of-factly , `` We 're not allowed in there , that 's all I know . '' </s>
<s> The 650-or-so local whites who are n't Orange Workers are more troubled . </s>
<s> Try as they might , they just ca n't conceive of life without black workers . </s>
<s> `` Impossible , impossible , '' say the Conradies , an elderly couple who have run the general store for decades . </s>
<s> `` We ca n't do without their help , '' says Mrs. Conradie . </s>
<s> `` Oh no . </s>
<s> We need them and I thank God for them . '' </s>
<s> Over at the Shell station , owner Rudi van Dyk , who doubles as Morgenzon 's mayor , worries that the Orange Workers have made his town the laughingstock of the nation . </s>
<s> `` What they want us to do just is n't practical , '' he says , noting that he employs 16 blacks . </s>
<s> `` I could n't afford to hire 16 whites . </s>
<s> The only Afrikaners who would be willing to work for this salary would n't know how to handle money . '' </s>
<s> Back at the Verwoerd house , Hendrik Sr. peers down over the shoulder of Hendrik Jr . </s>
<s> The son believes that when the Afrikaners finally realize there is no turning back the integration of South African society and politics , Morgenzon will boom . </s>
<s> `` We urge our people not to wait until they have to fight for their own nation , '' says Mr. Verwoerd . </s>
<s> `` By populating a place now , we make ourselves a power any new government will have to take into account . '' </s>
<s> Curiously , he compares the Orange Workers to the ANC , which his father outlawed in 1960 . </s>
<s> `` The ANC wo n't be stopped until there is a provision for black aspirations , '' says Mr. Verwoerd . </s>
<s> `` Likewise , no government will stop this idea of the Afrikaners . '' </s>
<s> He apologizes for sounding pushy . </s>
<s> `` Look , '' he says , `` If the rest of South Africa wants to have an integrated melting pot , that 's their choice . </s>
<s> We 'll leave them alone . </s>
<s> We just want to have our own cup of tea . '' </s>
<s> And they will even serve it themselves . </s>
