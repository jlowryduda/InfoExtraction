<s> Maggie Thatcher must be doing something right ; her political enemies are screaming louder than ever . </s>
<s> Mrs. Thatcher , who was practicing the read-my-lips school of politics years before Mr. Bush encountered it , has made clear her opposition to refashioning Britain 's free-market policies to suit the bureaucrats in Brussels . </s>
<s> In return , Mrs. Thatcher is excoriated from Fleet Street to Paris as an obstructionist . </s>
<s> Well , it now turns out that Mrs. Thatcher had to travel across the globe to the 49-member Commonwealth summit in Kuala Lumpur to discomfit the Holy Order of Consensus Builders . </s>
<s> `` A disastrous farce in Malaysia , '' screamed the Manchester Guardian . </s>
<s> `` She can no longer be trusted to behave in a civilised -- that is unflaky -- fashion when abroad . '' </s>
<s> Egad . </s>
<s> Canada 's Brian Mulroney and Australia 's Bob Hawke , the paper said , were `` enraged . '' </s>
<s> The London Times said she had `` contravened protocol . '' </s>
<s> As usual , her sin was saying what she thought . </s>
<s> She issued a separate statement , separating herself from a Commonwealth document reasserting the political value of imposing sanctions against South Africa . </s>
<s> While supporting the Commonwealth `` in utterly condemning apartheid , '' her statement urged it to `` encourage change '' rather than inflict further punishment on the country 's black population . </s>
<s> Actually there is a consensus somewhere on sanctions : In May a Gallup Poll found that most South African blacks , 85 % , oppose economic sanctions . </s>
<s> Still , Mrs. Thatcher had once again gone against the grain . </s>
<s> Malaysia 's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad sniffed , `` If everybody else puts out their left foot and you put out your right foot , you are out of step . '' </s>
<s> Mrs. Thatcher : `` If it 's one against 48 , I 'm very sorry for the 48 . '' </s>
<s> If indeed Mrs. Thatcher has one opponent that could throw her off political course it is Britain 's mysteriously intractable inflation problem . </s>
<s> We can not , however , join the political chorus that as one proclaims how offputting it is that Mrs. Thatcher refuses to get along by going along . </s>
<s> It is refreshing to see at least one world figure who knows what she believes in and is not inclined to reflexively compromise those beliefs . </s>
<s> Perhaps Mrs. Thatcher understands better than those distressed at her style that ultimately history and Britain 's voters will decide who is right about Europe , sanctioning South Africa or running Britain 's economy . </s>
