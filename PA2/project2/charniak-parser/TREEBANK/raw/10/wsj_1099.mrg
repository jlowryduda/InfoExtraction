<s> Former USX Corp. Chairman David M. Roderick may have been lucky he retired last May . </s>
<s> As he handed over the reins to successor Charles A. Corry , steel profits were close to a cyclical peak . </s>
<s> Though imports were troublesome , they were n't running away with the market , and American companies had high hopes that steel import quotas would be extended for another five years . </s>
<s> Perhaps most important , Carl Icahn , who had once threatened a hostile takeover bid , was subdued . </s>
<s> He and Mr. Roderick were even dining out together . </s>
<s> Today , Mr. Corry presides over a company whose fortunes have changed abruptly . </s>
<s> Mr. Icahn , the company 's deep-pocketed , tenacious adversary , recently disclosed that he had raised his USX stake to 13.1 % , and he again threatened a takeover . </s>
<s> A battle with Mr. Icahn would rattle even the most seasoned chief executive , to say nothing of one who took the helm less than five months ago . </s>
<s> In addition , USX 's giant steel segment , representing 34 % of its 1988 sales , is facing softening demand and slipping prices as well as increasing competition from foreign steelmakers and low-cost minimills . </s>
<s> The import quotas got only a 2 1\/2-year extension , and USX is laboring under a staggering $ 5.8 billion debt at a time when it must spend money to upgrade steel mills and drill for oil . </s>
<s> `` It 's a baptism of fire for Corry , '' says one USX executive . </s>
<s> The burning question is whether the new chief can parry Mr. Icahn without being pushed into unwelcome moves . </s>
<s> Mr. Corry might have to dismember the company more than he wants to . </s>
<s> Or he might have to incur a huge expense of either buying Mr. Icahn 's stock , possibly at a premium , or paying stockholders a special dividend partly because of Mr. Icahn 's pressure . </s>
<s> With his recent purchases of USX common stock , Mr. Icahn shattered a three-year-old , unwritten standstill agreement with Mr. Roderick . </s>
<s> In 1986 , Mr. Roderick adroitly dodged Mr. Icahn 's first bullet after the takeover specialist had built up an 11.4 % stake . </s>
<s> Mr. Roderick did so by having USX redeem a series of guaranteed notes , a move that , in effect , raised the cost of a $ 7.19 billion Icahn bid by about $ 3 billion . </s>
<s> And he managed to fend off further advances and even strike up an unlikely friendship with the interloper . </s>
<s> Over dinners at New York 's Sky Club and Links Club restaurants , the steel executive and the big investor talked steel , international trade and thoroughbred horses . </s>
<s> Mr. Corry , who has boned up on corporate raiders by reading T. Boone Pickens 's autobiography , had hoped the detente would continue . </s>
<s> He was shocked , associates say , to learn of Mr. Icahn 's new takeover threat . </s>
<s> -LRB- Both men declined to be interviewed for this article . -RRB- </s>
<s> But the fiercely competitive Mr. Corry quickly showed he 's no pushover . </s>
<s> He huddled with directors at a special meeting two weeks ago and tried to block his opponent . </s>
<s> Although the board believed that Mr. Icahn is more interested in talking the stock price higher than acquiring USX , it adopted a poison-pill defense , to be swallowed if anyone amasses a 15 % stake . </s>
<s> Now , it 's Mr. Icahn 's move . </s>
<s> Will he try to gain a seat on or control of the board and force a radical split of USX into separate oil and steel companies ? </s>
<s> Given the weakness of the junk-bond market , can he finance a buy-out ? </s>
<s> Mr. Icahn may not want to sell out unless he can get a special dividend similar to one he received before selling his stake in Texaco Inc. in June -- a coup that gave him enough cash to make his USX move . </s>
<s> And although the recent turmoil in the stock and junk-bond markets , by making it harder to arrange takeover financing , has eased some of the pressure on Mr. Corry , it does n't end the takeover threat . </s>
<s> `` I know it 's not over , '' a sober-faced Mr. Corry acknowledged while greeting steel suppliers in New York on Oct. 12 and inviting them to a buffet of salmon and sushi in honor of Kobe Steel Ltd. , USX 's partner in a steel mill in Lorain , Ohio . </s>
<s> In fact , it 's barely begun for Mr. Corry , who faces tough decisions before he has had a chance to get settled into his new job . </s>
<s> `` He 's in a vulnerable position because he has n't established much credibility on his own , '' says Bryan Jacoboski , a securities analyst at PaineWebber Inc . </s>
<s> The 57-year-old tax attorney never even aspired to the job of chief executive . </s>
<s> An undistinguished college student who dabbled in zoology until he concluded that he could n't stand cutting up frogs , Mr. Corry wanted to work for a big company `` that could do big things . '' </s>
<s> But after joining the tax department of a USX subsidiary 30 years ago , he set the modest goal of becoming tax manager by the age of 46 . </s>
<s> For years , he quietly stuck to the back accounting rooms , wearing a hat to work because everyone else did . </s>
<s> `` I was never a rebel , '' he said in an earlier interview . </s>
<s> `` I do n't think most of the people that have been around me would ever say they 've seen me pound the table or get angry . '' </s>
<s> Yet , the unassuming Mr. Corry helped chart USX 's transition from Big Steel to Big Oil . </s>
<s> He served as Mr. Roderick 's front man in tense negotiations for the 1982 purchase of Marathon Oil for $ 5.9 billion . </s>
<s> Nevertheless , Mr. Corry , once named chief executive , did n't waste any time distancing himself from his former boss , who still has an office on the 62nd floor of the USX tower in Pittsburgh . </s>
<s> Soon after taking over last June , Mr. Corry rescinded a pay cut imposed on clerical workers , a move that Mr. Roderick had n't made in spite of improved earnings . </s>
<s> Mr. Corry also ruled that all board meetings would be held in Pittsburgh instead of New York or Findlay , Ohio , Marathon 's home . </s>
<s> And , earlier this month , he announced the sale of the reserves of Texas Oil & Gas , which was acquired three years ago and has n't posted any significant operating profits since . </s>
<s> One former executive says , `` Nobody wanted that deal inside USX except Dave Roderick , '' who was a hunting and fishing buddy of William L. Hutchison , chairman of Texas Oil & Gas . </s>
<s> The executive recalls Mr. Corry whispering to him and others , `` Remember , this was Dave 's deal . '' </s>
<s> What miffed many USX executives and shareholders was that the acquisition , for $ 3 billion of stock , doubled the USX shares outstanding and considerably diluted them . </s>
<s> What 's more , the takeover occurred as natural-gas prices were falling and just as Texas Oil & Gas reported its first annual loss in 28 years . </s>
<s> Mr. Corry expected the Texas Oil & Gas sale to delight Mr. Icahn by addressing his concern about boosting shareholder value . </s>
<s> But when the two men met in New York a day after Mr. Icahn disclosed the rise in his USX stake , Mr. Corry learned that Mr. Icahn wanted him to sell all of Texas Oil -- not just its reserves of about 1.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 28 million barrels of oil but also its pipeline , gas-gathering and contract-drilling operations . </s>
<s> That would leave USX with Marathon , its steel mills and its diversified business segment , which includes , among other things , mineral and transportation products . </s>
<s> Some speculate that Mr. Corry would agree if he could find a buyer at the right price . </s>
<s> The problem is that Mr. Icahn is pushing him to move faster and further in restructuring USX than Mr. Corry had planned . </s>
<s> Mr. Icahn has long believed , associates say , that the company , whose 1988 sales totaled $ 16.88 billion , is worth $ 70 a share if broken up . </s>
<s> The stock closed yesterday at $ 33.625 , giving Mr. Icahn 's 33.6 million shares a value of $ 1.13 billion . </s>
<s> Mr. Icahn advocates the sale of the company 's steel operations , and Mr. Corry does n't necessarily disagree . </s>
<s> Unlike his predecessor , who saw steel as America 's backbone , Mr. Corry tends to view it as a capital-draining and labor-intensive business with limited potential , associates say . </s>
<s> In the past five years , USX has turned steel into a profit maker by closing several plants and reducing labor costs . </s>
<s> But the short-term outlook is so-so . </s>
<s> It is n't surprising that Messrs. Roderick and Corry view steel so differently . </s>
<s> While Mr. Roderick was reared in the shadows of Pittsburgh 's smoking mills , Mr. Corry grew up in Cincinnati , a city nicknamed `` Porkapolis '' and more accustomed to pork chops than pig iron . </s>
<s> He has never met Lynn Williams , the president of the United Steelworkers union , and is n't active in the industry 's main trade group , the American Iron and Steel Institute , which Mr. Roderick served as chairman . </s>
<s> `` Dave thought the country needed a strong U.S. Steel and , while Chuck agreed , he was more apt to say , ` Not at any cost to shareholders , ' '' a former executive says . </s>
<s> Indeed , Mr. Corry , at an August press conference , talked about investing in steel as long as it provides a good return and `` not a day longer . '' </s>
<s> However , shedding steel would run directly counter to Mr. Roderick 's original rationale for diversifying into oil and gas : Having two major products would lessen the company 's vulnerability to one market 's down cycle and help smooth out the flow of cash and earnings . </s>
<s> As Mr. Roderick once said : `` We 're a two-product company and , boy , if you ca n't figure out the value of those two parts , you are so damn dumb that you do n't belong on Wall Street . '' </s>
<s> Moreover , the opportunity to sell steel at a price acceptable to USX may be gone , for now . </s>
<s> `` The time has passed for us to spin off steel , '' either in a public offering or to a buyer , one executive contends . </s>
<s> About the only way that USX now can get out of steel is to dish it out , piece by piece , in separate joint ventures , he adds . </s>
<s> With Mr. Icahn breathing down his neck , however , Mr. Corry may have little choice but to sell at a weak price , even if it means losing some steel-related tax-loss carryforwards . </s>
<s> That would leave USX essentially an oil company with Marathon as its core . </s>
<s> Marathon has benefited from higher crude-oil prices and strong demand for refined products . </s>
<s> Oil has long been Mr. Corry 's pet . </s>
<s> Indeed , when the Bush administration finally decided this summer to renew import restrictions -- arguably the most important decision to affect the steel industry in five years -- Mr. Corry and his directors were aboard helicopters , high above Marathon 's rich oil reserves in the North Sea . </s>
<s> Should USX be left with only Marathon , Mr. Corry might well feel pushed to scout out other energy companies . </s>
<s> However , even USX executives who work closely with him are n't sure about his long-term goals . </s>
<s> `` I do n't think he has a clear sense of where he wants the company to go , '' one says . </s>
<s> Right now , the executive adds , `` he wants to continue to focus on paying down '' USX 's debt by selling assets . </s>
<s> One thing is certain , however : Mr. Corry , while studying other options , probably wo n't make a major move until he 's clear about Mr. Icahn 's intentions . </s>
<s> And then , `` he wo n't panic , '' says J. Bruce Johnston , a former USX executive and now a labor and benefit consultant with Adler Cohen & Grigsby in Pittsburgh . </s>
<s> Mr. Corry learned presence under fire when , as vice president of corporate planning , he handled what Mr. Johnston calls `` don't-con-me '' negotiations that led to USX 's shedding of a wide array of assets ranging from chemicals to construction . </s>
<s> When negotiating , Mr. Corry played his cards close to the vest . </s>
<s> Johnnie Johnson , who worked for Mr. Corry in strategic planning , recalls how his boss would routinely ask a subordinate to research an entire industry to target acquisition candidates . </s>
<s> `` What he really wanted to know was about a particular company , but you did n't know that . </s>
<s> He wanted your own unbiased , virgin opinion , '' says Mr. Johnson , now managing director at Georgeson & Co. , a proxy-solicitation and investor-relations firm . </s>
<s> Ever the pragmatist , Mr. Corry said in August that he realized that USX is on `` acquisition screens all over the country . '' </s>
<s> `` It 's part of the capitalistic market system that equity can be bought and equity is bought , '' he said . </s>
<s> USX , he noted , was formed 88 years ago , `` by in effect buying out a bunch of other companies ... . </s>
<s> People got rich through takeovers in those days , as they do today . '' </s>
