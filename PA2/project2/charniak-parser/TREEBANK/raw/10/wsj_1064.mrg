<s> American Telephone & Telegraph Co. unveiled new optical transmission systems for data , video and voice communications . </s>
<s> Two products in what the telecommunications giant called a new generation of such equipment are available now , AT&T said , and three others will be introduced in 1990 and 1991 . </s>
<s> The products are aimed at a market expected to total more than $ 1 billion a year in sales by 1995 , said Morgan Buchner Jr. , vice president of transmission systems for AT&T . </s>
<s> The products already available are cross-connect systems , used instead of mazes of wiring to interconnect other telecommunications equipment . </s>
<s> This cuts down greatly on labor , Mr. Buchner said . </s>
<s> To be introduced later are a multiplexer , which will allow several signals to travel along a single optical line ; a light-wave system , which carries voice channels ; and a network controller , which directs data flow through cross-connect systems . </s>
<s> AT&T said the products , unlike previous generations , will meet so-called Sonet compatability standards , which AT&T expects to be broadly adopted . </s>
<s> Sonet , or synchronous optical network , products have more capacity than earlier models . </s>
<s> `` These products are the heart of our transmission-product line , '' Mr. Buchner said . </s>
<s> He declined to disclose specific prices , but said each product costs in the tens of thousands , or even hundreds of thousands , of dollars . </s>
<s> AT&T said it expects to beat to the marketplace two rivals , Northern Telecom Ltd. of Canada and France 's Alcatel N.V. , which also have announced Sonet-based products . </s>
<s> AT&T predicted strong growth in demand for such products . </s>
<s> It noted that last July , Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. of Japan selected AT&T to supply $ 154 million of such equipment over a four-year period starting next year . </s>
