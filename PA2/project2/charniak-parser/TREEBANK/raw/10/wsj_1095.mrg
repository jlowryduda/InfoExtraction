<s> For the more than 43 million Americans with disabilities , the 1989 Americans With Disabilities Act provides the missing piece . </s>
<s> Disabled Americans have had their civil rights guaranteed in all federally funded programs since Section 504 was passed as a part of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act . </s>
<s> The 1989 act simply extends these guarantees to the private sector . </s>
<s> Those who fear a plethora of suits paralyzing our legal system need only look at the record on the Rehabilitation Act . </s>
<s> Without legal recourse , there are no guarantees of civil rights for anyone . </s>
