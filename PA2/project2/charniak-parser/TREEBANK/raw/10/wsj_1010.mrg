<s> Wall Street would like UAL Corp. 's board to change its mind about keeping the company independent . </s>
<s> But what happens next in the continuing takeover drama may depend more on the company 's two most powerful and fractious unions : the pilots and machinists . </s>
<s> Some people familiar with the situation believe that the collapse of the previous $ 6.79 billion buy-out , if anything , may have strengthened the hands of these two labor groups . </s>
<s> As a result , both may now have virtual veto power over any UAL transaction . </s>
<s> One reason : banks -- likely to react to any new UAL deal with even more caution than the first time around -- probably will insist on labor harmony before they agree to put up cash for any new bid or even a less-ambitious recapitalization plan . </s>
<s> `` United pilots have shown on a number of occasions they are willing and able to strike , '' said an executive at Fuji Bank , one of UAL 's large lenders . </s>
<s> `` If you have both -LCB- labor -RCB- groups on strike , you 've got no revenue and that 's a very scary thing for a bank to be looking at . '' </s>
<s> Just this past week , a leading Japanese bank asked for a meeting with the machinists ' union leaders to determine where the union would stand if another bid or recapitalization became possible . </s>
<s> Another reason : Emboldened by their success in helping to scuttle the previous transaction , the machinists are likely to be more aggressive if a second buy-out attempt occurs . </s>
<s> The two unions already had significant leverage simply because their employer has yet to settle with either on new contracts . </s>
<s> That gives them both the threat of a strike and the ability to resist any wage concessions that may be necessary to make a transaction work . </s>
<s> Thus , even investors who are pushing for the board to do a recapitalization that would pay shareholders a special dividend and possibly grant employees an ownership stake acknowledge that the unions are key . </s>
<s> `` There 's less likelihood of creating and completing a transaction without the unions ' cooperation and wage concessions , '' said Richard Nye , of Baker , Nye Investments , a New York takeover stock-trader . </s>
<s> Mr. Nye thinks the UAL board should be ousted if it does n't move soon to increase shareholder value . </s>
<s> Both the pilots and machinists have made it clear that they intend to block any transaction they do n't like . </s>
<s> `` The pilots will be involved in any transaction that takes place around here , '' pilot union chairman Frederick C. Dubinsky declared yesterday . </s>
<s> But whether the pilots can team up with their longtime adversaries , the machinists , is another question . </s>
<s> The pilots ' Mr. Dubinsky says his union would like majority ownership for employees . </s>
<s> At the very least , the pilots want some form of control over the airline , perhaps through super-majority voting rights . </s>
<s> On the other hand , the machinists have always opposed majority ownership in principle , saying they do n't think employees should be owners . </s>
<s> Still , in recent days , machinists ' union leaders have shown some new flexibility . </s>
<s> `` We may be able to reach a tradeoff where we can accommodate -LCB- the pilot union 's -RCB- concerns and ours , '' said Brian M. Freeman , the machinists ' financial adviser . </s>
<s> Mr. Freeman said machinists ' union advisers plan to meet this week to try to draw up a blueprint for some form of recapitalization that could include a special dividend for shareholders , an employee stake and , perhaps , an equity investment by a friendly investor . </s>
<s> If a compromise ca n't be reached , the pilots maintain they can do a transaction without the support of the machinists . </s>
<s> But at this point , that may just be wishful thinking . </s>
<s> The machinists lobbied heavily against the original bid from UAL pilots and management for the company . </s>
<s> Their opposition helped scare off some Japanese banks . </s>
<s> The pilots ' insistence on majority ownership also may make the idea of a recapitalization difficult to achieve . </s>
<s> `` Who wants to be a public shareholder investing in a company controlled by the pilots ' union ? '' asks Candace Browning , an analyst at Wertheim Schroeder & Co . </s>
<s> `` Who would the board be working for -- the public shareholders or the pilots ? '' she adds . </s>
<s> Ms. Browning says she believes a recapitalization involving employee ownership would succeed only if the pilots relent on their demand for control . </s>
<s> She also notes that even if the pilots accept a minority stake now , they still could come back at a later time and try to take control . </s>
<s> Another possibility is for the pilots ' to team up with an outside investor who might try to force the ouster of the board through the solicitation of consents . </s>
<s> In that way , the pilots may be able to force the board to approve a recapitalization that gives employees a majority stake , or to consider the labor-management group 's latest proposal . </s>
<s> The group did n't make a formal offer , but instead told UAL 's advisers before the most-recent board meeting that it was working on a bid valued at between $ 225 and $ 240 a share . </s>
<s> But again , they may need the help of the machinists . </s>
<s> `` I think the dynamics of this situation are that something 's got to happen , '' said one official familiar with the situation . </s>
<s> The board and UAL 's management , he says , `` ca n't go back '' to business as usual . </s>
<s> `` The pilots wo n't let them . </s>
