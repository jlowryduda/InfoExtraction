<s> International Business Machines Corp. said it agreed to let Motorola Inc. participate in a semiconductor research project as part of its effort to bolster the U.S. semiconductor industry . </s>
<s> IBM , which made the announcement at the dedication of a research center here , said it invited many other companies to participate as well , including some from Europe . </s>
<s> Jack Kuehler , IBM 's president , said IBM is also considering letting other companies participate in additional semiconductor work but declined to be more specific . </s>
<s> IBM , which said a year ago it was inviting companies to participate in some semiconductor work , has become far more open about its technology as it has tried to rally U.S. industry to head off the Japanese , who now dominate the market for dynamic random access memory chips . </s>
<s> While IBM , Armonk , N.Y. , makes the bulk of the DRAMs it uses , it does n't make the equipment needed to produce those chips . </s>
<s> And IBM worries that the Japanese will take over that equipment market , too , unless U.S. semiconductor companies produce enough memory chips here to keep U.S. equipment makers healthy . </s>
<s> Failure of U.S. equipment makers , IBM fears , would leave it dependent on many of the Japanese companies that compete with it in other parts of the market . </s>
<s> IBM also said it expects to benefit from the expertise that Motorola and other companies can bring to bear on the difficult problems involved in semiconductor manufacturing . </s>
<s> IBM already participates in one industrywide effort to improve semiconductor-manufacturing techniques . </s>
<s> IBM said it expects industrywide efforts to become prevalent because semiconductor manufacturing has become so expensive . </s>
<s> A state-of-the-art plant cost $ 40 million in the mid-1970s but costs $ 500 million today because the technology is so complex . </s>
<s> And IBM said it expects the costs to continue climbing . </s>
<s> IBM , which said Motorola is paying just a nominal fee to cover the 21-month agreement , acknowledged some companies had turned down its invitation to join in . </s>
<s> But it said that was mainly because the project may not bear fruit until the mid-1990s . </s>
<s> IBM said it thought more companies would become interested as the project progresses . </s>
<s> The project involving Motorola concerns a technique , called X-ray lithography , that figures to be crucial to future generations of memory chips . </s>
<s> Currently , chips are produced by shining light through a mask to produce an image on the chip , much as a camera produces an image on film . </s>
<s> But details on chips must now be extraordinarily fine , and the wavelengths of even ultraviolet light are long enough so that the images they draw may be too blurry -- much as someone using a wide paintbrush could produce a broad line but would have trouble painting a thin one . </s>
<s> X-rays , by contrast , travel straighter and can be focused more tightly than light . </s>
<s> X-rays have problems , too . </s>
<s> They can make the masks brittle and can pass through material they 're not supposed to . </s>
<s> But , assuming those problems can be overcome , they should allow for memory chips that could approach one billion bits of information -- 250 times as much as is contained in the four-megabit chips that are just reaching the market and a million times what was possible in the mid-1970s . </s>
