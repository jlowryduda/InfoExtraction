<s> The bad news in the junk bond market yesterday was that TW Services , a group of restaurant chains , became the latest prospective issuer to get a cold shoulder from bond buyers . </s>
<s> The good news -- to fans of stable credit , at least -- is what the rejection says about the state of mind of junk buyers . </s>
<s> Apparently they are learning to say no to excess risk . </s>
<s> Coniston Partners , which with related entities controls 80 % of TW , had been planning to sell $ 1.15 billion of junk bonds , among other things to finance their acquisition of the remaining public shares . </s>
<s> But Coniston , a New York partnership managed by the firm of Gollust , Tierney & Oliver , yesterday announced that `` in view of unsettled conditions in securities markets '' the offering would be postponed and restructured . </s>
<s> What was n't mentioned is that Coniston and its investment banker , Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette , just completed a two-week `` road show '' for the purpose of marketing the bonds . </s>
<s> And investors , at least for now , took a pass . </s>
<s> TW 's junk bonds were n't , as junk bonds go , unusually weak . </s>
<s> Its fast-food restaurants -- including Denny 's , Hardee 's , Quincy 's and El Pollo Loco -LRB- `` the only significant fast-food chain to specialize in char-broiled chicken '' -RRB- -- are stable , recession-resistant and growing . </s>
<s> But unless they continued to grow , TW , based in Paramus , N.J. , would have run into trouble . </s>
<s> Until recently , such buy-now , pray-for-growth-later deals were routine . </s>
<s> `` But people do n't buy anything on expectation anymore , '' says Jack Utter , who manages the high-yield fund of IDS Financial Services . </s>
<s> `` Investors , '' he adds , `` are getting religion . '' </s>
<s> The TW buy-out may yet be financed . </s>
<s> `` There is nothing wrong with the company , '' says Coniston principal Paul Tierney . </s>
<s> The rub , he says , is that `` the junk market is n't as deep '' as before . </s>
<s> TW 's stockholder meeting was postponed from tomorrow to Nov. 21 . </s>
<s> By then , DLJ hopes to be able to sell less-junky junk bonds . </s>
<s> Gollust , Tierney & Oliver is likely to contribute more than the $ 120 million in equity it had planned on . </s>
<s> Banks may contribute more senior debt . </s>
<s> And the total amount of junk financing will be reduced . </s>
<s> A DLJ banker , putting a best possible face on it , asserts that `` very few people said they did n't like the credit quality . </s>
<s> People said they did n't think a billion-dollar deal would trade . '' </s>
<s> But trading risk stems from credit risk . </s>
<s> And by adding equity , DLJ would seem to be acknowledging that credit risk was a concern . </s>
<s> Indeed , the DLJ banker says , in the reborn capital structure cash coverage of interest `` will meaningfully improve . '' </s>
<s> As he sums it up : `` We are listening to the market . '' </s>
<s> What is it , to borrow a term from Coniston , that so unsettled the market ? </s>
<s> Some of the same risks that were cited -- and seemingly ignored -- in dozens of previous junk offerings . </s>
<s> The TW prospectus says that if the acquisition had been completed earlier , pretax earnings `` would have been insufficient to cover its fixed charges , including interest on debt securities , '' by approximately $ 62.7 million in the first six months of 1989 . </s>
<s> TW notes , as many junk issuers do , that `` adjusted to eliminate non-cash charges '' TW would have run a cash surplus -- in this case , of $ 56 million over six months . </s>
<s> But such calculations ignore the noncash charge of depreciation , taken to allow for the gradual wearing out of french friers , deterioration of stores and the like . </s>
<s> In fact , DLJ says , the company envisions capital expenses of about $ 180 million a year . </s>
<s> TW 's pitch was that sales and earnings at its restaurants have risen steadily and that people wo n't stop eating during a downturn . </s>
<s> But they wo n't necessarily eat at Denny 's . </s>
<s> The fast-food business is `` intensely competitive , '' notes Wertheim Schroder analyst John Rohs . </s>
<s> Prospective bond buyers noted that TW historically has prospered because it has been willing to spend aggressively on remodeling restaurants and redoing menus . </s>
<s> `` We were concerned that they were n't going to generate enough cash for capital spending and also to pay down debt , '' says a big investor in high-yield debt . </s>
<s> DLJ argues that TW could , if necessary , cut capital spending , since half of what it plans to spend is for `` growth , '' rather than maintenance . </s>
<s> But investors noted that under the shelved offering , TW would have needed to grow to meet its debt payments . </s>
<s> Its calculations for meeting cash charges ignore $ 52 million a year in interest on cash-deferred , or zero-coupon debentures -- which ultimately would have had to be paid . </s>
<s> The prospectus notes `` there can be no assurance '' that future growth will continue at past levels . </s>
<s> In the recent past , bond buyers did n't seek such assurance . </s>
<s> Now , apparently , they do . </s>
