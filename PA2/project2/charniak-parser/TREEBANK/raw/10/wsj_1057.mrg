<s> One day last March , CBS Sports President Neal Pilson and Olympics superagent Barry Frank met for lunch at the Lotos Club here . </s>
<s> Mr. Frank told Mr. Pilson that Olympics officials wanted $ 290 million or more for TV rights to the 1994 Winter Games in Norway . </s>
<s> The CBS official said that price sounded fine . </s>
<s> At that price , CBS was the only player at the table when negotiations with the International Olympic Committee started in Toronto Aug. 23 . </s>
<s> Dick Pound , a committee member , began by disclosing that ABC and NBC had refused to even bid . </s>
<s> Then , he asked Mr. Pilson to raise his offer anyway : `` If we can have a number that starts with a three , you can have a dea . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Pilson and his team huddled in a hallway and took just 10 minutes to return with a $ 300 million offer . </s>
<s> Mr. Pound responded , `` It 's a deal . '' </s>
<s> A beaming Mr. Pilson announced his lastest coup at a news conference that afternoon . </s>
<s> Mr. Pilson 's rivals at ABC and NBC grimaced at the price . </s>
<s> How could CBS get pushed into outbidding itself ? </s>
<s> Well , CBS , mired in the ratings cellar and looking to sports as a way out , wanted to close the deal immediately and block its rivals from getting another chance to bid . </s>
<s> But Mr. Pilson has been put in the uncomfortable role of setting off a bidding frenzy for sports rights , a frenzy that the networks had hoped to avoid . </s>
<s> `` The price of poker has gone up , '' crows Charles M. Neinas , the College Football Association 's executive director . </s>
<s> With CBS Inc. on a spending spree that may top $ 2.5 billion for four years of major sports events , the new bout of hyperinflation could jolt the entire broadcast business . </s>
<s> CBS itself could run up losses of a few hundred million dollars on four years of various sports if its big gamble goes wrong . </s>
<s> ABC , a unit of Capital Cities\/ABC Inc. , and General Electric Co. 's National Broadcasting Co. also risk losses if they outbid CBS for other contracts . </s>
<s> While rights fees head skyward , ad rates wo n't . </s>
<s> Advertisers already are balking at higher prices . </s>
<s> `` The networks are paying too much for rights , '' warns adman Paul Isacsson of Young & Rubicam . </s>
<s> `` If they ask advertisers to absorb the costs , they 're likely to lose all but a few who need sports , above all . '' </s>
<s> Viewers may not be cheering , either . </s>
<s> Soaring rights fees will lead to an even greater clutter of commercials . </s>
<s> At the same time , some sports events will move off `` free '' television and onto cable or pay-cable , where half the nation 's TV homes ca n't see them . </s>
<s> CBS has changed the rules by throwing out the old basis for sports bids -- that is , can the network alone make a profit on it ? </s>
<s> Mr. Pilson emphasizes the ancillary benefits of positive press , contented affiliate stations , enthusiastic advertisers and huge audiences that might stick around to watch other CBS programs when the game is over . </s>
<s> The billion-dollar question is , How much are those benefits worth ? </s>
<s> Some TV people doubt they will materialize and argue that even if they do , they wo n't offset the multimillion-dollar deficits that CBS could run up . </s>
<s> `` As we 've seen in the '80s , '' says Roger Werner , the president of the ESPN sports channel , `` those deals can turn sour if the numbers do n't work . </s>
<s> And three years later , in a sea of red ink , the heroes can find themselves with a lot of explaining to do . '' </s>
<s> CBS pursues top sports `` to belie the fact that they are n't supporting affiliates , viewers and advertisers , '' charges Thomas H. Wyman , who was ousted as chairman of CBS Inc. after Laurence A. Tisch bought a 24.9 % stake in the company and took over three years ago . </s>
<s> `` They lost the entertainment crown , and they needed one . </s>
<s> And they 've bought one . '' </s>
<s> On just three big deals -- for four years of baseball and for the Olympic Winter Games in both 1992 and 1994 -- Pilson bid a total of $ 1.64 billion . </s>
<s> That 's well over half a billion dollars more than ABC and NBC were willing to pay . </s>
<s> -LRB- After 1992 , the winter and summer Olympics will be held two years apart , with the revised schedule beginning with the winter games in 1994 and the summer games in 1996 . -RRB- </s>
<s> Now , Mr. Pilson -- a former college basketball player who says a good negotiator needs `` a level of focus and intellectual attention '' similar to a good athlete-s is facing the consequences of his own aggressiveness . </s>
<s> Next month , talks will begin on two coveted CBS contracts , for the pro and college basketball finals . </s>
<s> CBS is likely to spend whatever it takes to keep them . </s>
<s> The potential bill : more than $ 600 million for several seasons , an 80 % jump . </s>
<s> A few months later , CBS 's college and pro football contracts come up for renewal ; they could go for close to $ 100 million more than CBS now pays , a 40 % to 50 % rise . </s>
<s> `` What happens to those two basketball contracts will shape the next five years of network sports , '' says Peter Lund , a former CBS Sports president now at Multimedia Inc . </s>
<s> J. William Grimes , former president of ESPN , says NBC may `` come in with a huge bid for college basketball to take it away from CBS and say , ` We can overbid , too . ' </s>
<s> And the winners will be the colleges , not either network . </s>
<s> Nor , by the way , advertisers . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Pilson is an unlikely big spender . </s>
<s> In the mid-1980s , after ABC had just bid a record $ 309 million for the 1988 Winter Games , he sniped at rivals for paying reckless prices . </s>
<s> `` I love Pilson , but he was the guy who complained most bitterly and loudly , '' says Robert Wussler , a former CBS Sports president . </s>
<s> `` And yet his company is one reason why rights are so high today . '' </s>
<s> Rivals carp at `` the principle of Pilson , '' as NBC 's Arthur Watson once put it -- `` he 's always expounding that rights are too high , then he 's going crazy . '' </s>
<s> But the 49-year-old Mr. Pilson is hardly a man to ignore the numbers . </s>
<s> A Yale law school graduate , he began his career in corporate law and then put in years at Metromedia Inc. and the William Morris talent agency . </s>
<s> In 1976 , he joined CBS Sports to head business affairs and , five years later , became its president . </s>
<s> Mr. Pilson says that when he spoke out a few years ago , `` I did n't say forever , and I did n't say every property . '' </s>
<s> The market changed , he adds . </s>
<s> And he is n't the only big spender : NBC will pay a record $ 401 million for the 1992 Summer Games , and ESPN , 80%-owned by Capital Cities\/ABC , will shell out $ 400 million for four years of baseball , airing 175 regular-season games a year . </s>
<s> `` Our competitors say we overbid them . </s>
<s> Who cares ? </s>
<s> Maybe we recognize values the other guys do n't , '' Mr. Pilson says . </s>
<s> Mr. Pilson 's `` Major Events '' strategy jelled after Mr. Tisch took over . </s>
<s> Mr. Pilson recalls that in April 1986 , after CBS 's annual meeting in Philadelphia , he and Mr. Tisch took the 90-minute train ride back to New York , and Mr. Pilson used this extended private audience to outline his ambitions . </s>
<s> Mr. Tisch , a billionaire in hotels and finance , was just learning the TV business . </s>
<s> Five months later , Mr. Tisch took over as CBS 's chief executive , and soon he was wielding sole approval each time Mr. Pilson scribbled a frighteningly large figure on a slip of paper , sealed it in an envelope and gave it to sports negotiators . </s>
<s> Then , in May 1988 , Mr. Tisch urgently needed to make a bold statement to quell rumors that he might sell the network . </s>
<s> Mr. Pilson gave him one : He bid $ 243 million for rights to the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville , France ; ABC and NBC would n't bid even $ 200 million . </s>
<s> That started the still-raging bidding wars . </s>
<s> The `` Major Events '' strategy , Mr. Pilson says , is designed to notch a place for CBS on the crowded TV dial of the 1990s . </s>
<s> It 's also a fast fix for an ailing image . </s>
<s> He sees flashy sports as the only way the last-place network can cut through the clutter of cable and VCRs , grab millions of new viewers and tell them about other shows premiering a few weeks later . </s>
<s> Next October , CBS , for the first time , wo n't have to start the season against the much-watched American and National baseball league championships and the World Series . </s>
<s> `` I 've been struggling against that for years , '' says Jonathan Rodgers , who runs WBBM-TV , the CBS-owned station in Chicago . </s>
<s> Even if baseball triggers losses at CBS -- and he does n't think it will -- `` I 'd rather see the games on our air than on NBC and ABC , '' he says . </s>
<s> That is n't surprising . </s>
<s> Regular TV series ratings have slumped in the past five years , and premiering new shows is `` a crap shoot , '' Mr. Pilson says . </s>
<s> But top sports events are still a strong bet to lure audiences 30 % or 40 % larger than those CBS usually gets . </s>
<s> Mr. Pilson says baseball and the Olympics may help CBS move up to No. 2 in the household ratings race , putting pizazz back into the network 's image . </s>
<s> And the Winter Olympics will air during the February `` sweeps , '' when ratings are used to set ad rates for local stations . </s>
<s> That will please once-grumpy affiliates -- another aim of the Pilson plan . </s>
<s> They gleefully await the `` dream season '' in 1990 . </s>
<s> CBS will air the Super Bowl , baseball playoffs , college and pro basketball finals and other premier sports events . </s>
<s> `` It 's made me more committed to CBS , '' says Philip A. Jones , the president of Meredith Corp. 's broadcast group , which has two CBS affiliates . </s>
<s> The CBS plan to use big-time sports as a platform for other series carries no guarantee of success , however . </s>
<s> No amount of hype will bring viewers back if the shows are weak . </s>
<s> `` In this market of 40 channels , sophisticated viewers and the remote control , trial is n't a guarantee of anything , '' ESPN 's Mr. Werner says . </s>
<s> `` If the show ai n't a killer , they 're gone . '' </s>
<s> During the 1984 Summer Games , for example , ABC touted `` Call to Glory , '' but the military drama was missing in action within weeks . </s>
<s> Last October , during the 1988 Summer Games , NBC relentlessly pitched a new series , `` Tattingers . '' </s>
<s> It belly-flopped anyway . </s>
<s> Moreover , sports is hardly the best way to lure adult women . </s>
<s> Though CBS might move up to No. 2 in household ratings , most advertisers buy based on ratings for women aged 18 to 49 . </s>
<s> CBS may remain a distant No. 3 in that regard . </s>
<s> Nor is CBS a shoo-in to get blockbuster ratings . </s>
<s> In recent years , the World Series and the Olympics were aired against CBS 's last-place lineup . </s>
<s> But CBS will put the athletes up against Bill Cosby , `` Cheers '' and other shows in NBC 's No. 1 schedule . </s>
<s> Even the boon to affiliate relations may be limited . </s>
<s> The sports lineup may add only 1 % to 5 % to a station 's annual profits . </s>
<s> It alone is n't likely to stop a station from dumping CBS shows . </s>
<s> `` The World Series , seven nights , was n't enough of an incentive , '' says Arnold Klinsky of WHEC-TV in Rochester , which dropped CBS for NBC six weeks ago . </s>
<s> `` You 've got to judge where the network will be in three years . '' </s>
<s> The intangible benefits may prove extremely costly if CBS ca n't avoid big losses on the sports coverage itself . </s>
<s> And avoiding such losses will take a monumental effort . </s>
<s> On the $ 1.06 billion baseball agreement alone , CBS is likely to lose $ 250 million in four years , contends Mr. Wussler , the former CBS man , now at Comsat Inc . </s>
<s> Nevertheless , he deems the deal `` plain smart '' for its huge promotional value . </s>
<s> Mr. Pilson calls that loss estimate `` wildly inaccurate , '' conceding only that CBS will lose money on baseball in the first year . </s>
<s> `` It 's too early to tell '' what happens after that , he says . </s>
<s> But Mr. Tisch expects losses in all four years of the contract , he told U.S. senators last June . </s>
<s> CBS will pay an average of $ 82 million more each year than ABC and NBC had paid together -- and those two networks expect losses on baseball this season . </s>
<s> Yet CBS will air only 12 regular-season games , 26 fewer than ABC and NBC . </s>
<s> That has outraged some fans . </s>
<s> It also indicates a $ 50 million drop in ad sales for regular-season games -- a risk CBS took to get an unprecedented lock on all playoff games . </s>
<s> If the playoffs end in four-game sweeps , losses could soar . </s>
<s> Advertisers are resisting higher prices , which would help close the gap . </s>
<s> CBS signed General Motors and Toyota to be the only auto-maker sponsors in baseball for four years . </s>
<s> Price : $ 265 million . </s>
<s> But ad executives who negotiated the deal say that works out to only $ 275,000 for a 30-second ad in the World Series through 1993 -- 17 % less than what ABC is charging for the Series this month . </s>
<s> Moreover , `` there 's no question ad rates will come down considerably '' from the GM-Toyota price , says Arnold Chase of Bozell Inc . </s>
<s> Other admen , however , say rates could rise later if ad spending surges . </s>
<s> The Winter Games outlook also is mixed . </s>
<s> CBS expects to make modest profits , but rivals contend that it will take a beating . </s>
<s> ABC lost $ 75 million on the 1988 Winter Games , partly because of its $ 309 million rights fee . </s>
<s> It aired 94.5 hours of mostly live events in Calgary -- helping raise ratings slightly from 1984 -- but still failed to deliver the audience promised to advertisers . </s>
<s> CBS will add 25 1\/2 hours to that load in 1992 , and ratings could be hurt by a lack of live events . </s>
<s> All prime-time fare will be on tape-delay because of time differences with Norway , so the results can be announced on the 6 o'clock news . </s>
<s> -LRB- Turner Broadcasting will pay CBS $ 25 million to air 50 hours of CBS coverage plus 50 hours of additional events . -RRB- </s>
<s> Barry Frank , the agent who took Mr. Pilson to lunch last March , says that even if CBS loses , say , $ 10 million , it matters little . </s>
<s> `` Ten million ai n't jack , man , when you got $ 3 billion sitting in the bank , '' says Mr. Frank , senior vice president at International Management Group , citing CBS 's enormous cash reserves from selling off various businesses . </s>
<s> `` It does n't mean anything -- it 's public-relations money . '' </s>
<s> Moreover , sports has `` claimed its place '' as a guaranteed ratings-getter , says David J. Stern , the commissioner of the National Basketball Association . </s>
<s> `` This is n't outlandish bidding ; this is a situation of very careful businessmen making judgments about the worth of product and acting on it ... . </s>
<s> I would tend to trust their judgment . '' </s>
<s> That 's easy for him to say : CBS 's four-year NBA pact , now at $ 176 million for four years , could double in price by the time his talks with Mr. Pilson are completed later this month . </s>
<s> That would cut into CBS 's slim margin for profit -- and error . </s>
<s> CBS Sports earned $ 50 million or so last year . </s>
<s> And CBS takes in the least money in prime time ; ABC and NBC charge 30 % to 35 % more for ads , according to a Variety survey . </s>
<s> But CBS 's costs are huge , and the risks go up with each new sports package that CBS locks up . </s>
<s> Although sports officials predict jumps of 50 % to 100 % in the major contracts coming up for renewal , ad rates may rise only 20 % . </s>
<s> CBS hopes to save money by ordering fewer episodes of regular series because sports will fill up a few weeks of prime time . </s>
<s> But the savings will be minuscule . </s>
<s> Each hour of Olympics and baseball in prime time will cost CBS $ 2.6 million to $ 2.8 million ; an hour-long drama costs only $ 900,000 , and it is aired twice . </s>
<s> CBS may cushion losses with about $ 200 million a year in interest earned on the proceeds from selling CBS Records and other businesses . </s>
<s> But media-stock analyst Richard J. MacDonald of MacDonald Grippo Riely says Wall Street wo n't take kindly to that . </s>
<s> `` On a stand-alone basis , the network ought to make money , '' he says . </s>
<s> When Mr. Pilson is asked directly -- can you make money on all this ? -- he does n't exactly say yes . </s>
<s> `` What you 're really asking is , Are the profit and loss margins anticipated on the events acceptable to management ? '' he says . </s>
<s> Then , he answers his own question . </s>
<s> `` Yes , they are . </s>
<s> That 's the only question we need to address . </s>
