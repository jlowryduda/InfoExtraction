<s> Kemper Financial Services Inc. , charging that program trading is ruining the stock market , cut off four big Wall Street firms from doing any of its stock-trading business . </s>
<s> The move is the biggest salvo yet in the renewed outcry against program trading , with Kemper putting its money -- the millions of dollars in commissions it generates each year -- where its mouth is . </s>
<s> The Kemper Corp. unit and other critics complain that program trading causes wild swings in stock prices , such as on Tuesday and on Oct. 13 and 16 , and has increased chances for market crashes . </s>
<s> Over the past nine months , several firms , including discount broker Charles Schwab & Co. and Sears , Roebuck & Co. 's Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. unit , have attacked program trading as a major market evil . </s>
<s> Several big securities firms backed off from program trading a few months after the 1987 crash . </s>
<s> But most of them , led by Morgan Stanley & Co. , moved back in earlier this year . </s>
<s> The most volatile form of program trading is index arbitrage -- the rapid-fire , computer-guided buying and selling of stocks offset with opposite trades in stock-index futures and options . </s>
<s> The object is to capture profits from fleeting price discrepancies between the futures and options and the stocks themselves . </s>
<s> Index arbitrage recently has accounted for about half of all program trading on the New York Stock Exchange . </s>
<s> Last month , program trading accounted for 20.9 million shares a day , or a record 13.8 % of the Big Board 's average daily volume . </s>
<s> On Tuesday afternoon , Kemper told Bear , Stearns & Co. , General Electric Co. 's Kidder , Peabody & Co. unit , Morgan Stanley and Oppenheimer & Co. that it will no longer do business with them because of their commitment to index arbitrage , officials inside and outside these firms confirmed . </s>
<s> Kemper officials declined to identify the firms but acknowledged a long-simmering dispute with four securities firms and said the list of brokers it wo n't do business with may be lengthened in the months ahead . </s>
<s> `` We 've been opposed to '' index arbitrage `` for a long time , '' said Stephen B. Timbers , chief investment officer at Kemper , which manages $ 56 billion , including $ 8 billion of stocks . </s>
<s> `` Index arbitrage does n't work , and it scares natural buyers '' of stock . </s>
<s> While Mr. Timbers explained he 's `` not totally convinced index arbitrage changes the overall level of the stock market , '' he said that `` on an intraday basis , it has major effects . </s>
<s> We 've talked to proponents of index arbitrage and told them to cool it because they 're ruining the market . </s>
<s> They said , ` Too bad , ' so we finally said we 're not going to do business with them . '' </s>
<s> Kemper also blasted the Big Board for ignoring the interests of individual and institutional holders . </s>
<s> `` The New York Stock Exchange has vested interests '' in its big member securities firms `` that cloud its objectivity , '' Mr. Timbers said . </s>
<s> `` It has never been interested in what we think . </s>
<s> The Big Board also has a terrible communication problem with individual investors , '' he added . </s>
<s> Small investors perceive that `` big operators '' dominate the market , said Thomas O'Hara , chairman of the National Association of Investors and head of the exchange 's Individual Investors Advisory Committee set up after the 1987 crash . </s>
<s> `` The impression I 've got is they 'd love to do away with it -LCB- program trading -RCB- , but they -LCB- the exchange -RCB- ca n't do it , '' he said . </s>
<s> Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan said in a recent interview that he has no inclination to eliminate program trading . </s>
<s> He said the market 's volatility disturbs him , but that all the exchange can do is `` slow down the process '' by using its circuit breakers and shock absorbers . </s>
<s> Mr. Timbers countered that `` the mere fact they put in circuit breakers is an admission of their problems . '' </s>
<s> Morgan Stanley and Kidder Peabody , the two biggest program trading firms , staunchly defend their strategies . </s>
<s> `` We continue to believe the position we 've taken is reasonable , '' a Morgan Stanley official said . </s>
<s> `` We would stop index arbitrage when the market is under stress , and we have recently , '' he said , citing Oct. 13 and earlier this week . </s>
<s> Michael Carpenter , president and chief executive officer at Kidder Peabody , said in a recent interview , `` We do n't think that index arbitrage has a negative impact on the market as a whole . '' </s>
<s> According to Lawrence Eckenfelder , a securities industry analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. , `` Kemper is the first firm to make a major statement with program trading . '' </s>
<s> He added that `` having just one firm do this is n't going to mean a hill of beans . </s>
<s> But if this prompts others to consider the same thing , then it may become much more important . </s>
