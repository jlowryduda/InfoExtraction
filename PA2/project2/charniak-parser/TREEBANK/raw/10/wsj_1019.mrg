<s> The New York Stock Exchange is expected to launch its own program trading vehicle today , just as controversy over this trading strategy heats up . </s>
<s> The Big Board this morning plans to begin trading its Exchange Stock Portfolio `` basket '' product , the first program-trading vehicle carrying the exchange 's seal of approval . </s>
<s> ESPs will allow institutional investors to buy or sell all 500 stocks in Standard & Poor 's index in a single trade of a minimum of $ 5 million . </s>
<s> `` Customized '' baskets of fewer stocks will also be available . </s>
<s> The Securities and Exchange Commission gave provisional six-month approval to the Big Board basket at a meeting late yesterday . </s>
<s> The SEC at the same time approved a similar but smaller basket product on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , where the minimum will be $ 1.7 million . </s>
<s> Also approved was a plan to trade stock portfolios by computer after regular hours on the Midwest Stock Exchange . </s>
<s> The basket products are `` an evolutionary step '' in solving problems in trading big blocks of stock that came to light in the 1987 market crash , said SEC Commissioner Joseph Grundfest . </s>
<s> New SEC Chairman Richard Breeden , overseeing his first public meeting , said there have been concerns that the Big Board 's basket could attract investors with a `` short-term perspective '' who would rapidly turn over the product , thus increasing volatility . </s>
<s> But Richard Ketchum , the SEC 's market regulation chief , said he did n't believe `` this will spawn dramatic new program-trading strategies that will be destabilizing . '' </s>
<s> The baskets on the Big Board and CBOE -- which involve the actual S&P stocks , unlike the stock-index contracts currently traded on the Chicago futures markets , and index options on the CBOE -- will begin trading as critics step up their attacks on program trading and its contributions to the stock market 's wild price swings . </s>
<s> The Big Board argues that its new product will help rather than hurt the situation by possibly drawing business from more-volatile forms of program trading . </s>
<s> ESPs are also an attempt by the Big Board to head off the exodus of program trading business to overseas markets such as London . </s>
<s> Big Board officials also hope Japanese investors will become interested in the exchange 's product . </s>
<s> Already , many of the Big Board 's own floor traders are warning that the ESP baskets are risky and not in the best interests of the investing public . </s>
<s> The 400-member Alliance of Floor Brokers said the new product , with the $ 5 million minimum , will benefit only big institutional investors and could lead to `` wild spasms of volatility . '' </s>
<s> Stockbrokers who cater to individual investors said the Big Board 's new product confirms the exchange does n't want to curtail program trading , which last month accounted for a record 13.8 % of the exchange 's average daily volume . </s>
<s> `` The New York Stock Exchange is losing its cool here , '' said James Andrews , head of institutional trading at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia . </s>
<s> The new stock baskets `` are going to make it easier for program trading to be done . </s>
<s> And it 's going to be done more frequently as the result of having more access to it at different places . '' </s>
<s> Both the Big Board 's Exchange Stock Portfolio and the Chicago exchange 's Market Basket are designed for institutional investors . </s>
<s> The Big Board lists its targets as pension plans , mutual fund managers and index-arbitrage traders . </s>
<s> In index arbitrage , program traders buy and sell stocks and stock-index futures to profit from small price discrepancies between the markets . </s>
<s> At the same time , only four securities firms have signed up with the Big Board to buy and sell ESPs as market makers , an unenthusiastic response . </s>
<s> The market makers so far are CS First Boston Group 's First Boston Corp. unit , Morgan Stanley & Co. , PaineWebber Group Inc. and Salomon Inc. 's Salomon Brothers Inc. unit . </s>
<s> Kidder , Peabody & Co. , a General Electric Co. unit that has become the biggest program trader along with Morgan Stanley , is n't a market maker , although the Big Board hopes that will change . </s>
<s> Similarly , the Big Board hopes to entice Merrill Lynch & Co . </s>
<s> Neither has plans to be a market maker for now . </s>
<s> Traders said major securities firms are reluctant to become market makers because they fear the baskets may attract only limited trading . </s>
<s> Big Board officials say only 25 contracts a day may trade at first , equivalent to a day 's action at a small , regional exchange . </s>
<s> Even though the Big Board says its product represents a post-crash `` reform , '' some traders suggest that if the new basket had been trading during this month 's Friday the 13th market plunge , the Dow Jones Industrial Average might have dropped more than the 190 points it did . </s>
<s> With the futures locked into a trading halt Oct. 13 and trading in some individual stock difficult , program traders would have undoubtedly fled to the basket system , the traders say . </s>
<s> `` If we had the baskets , we would be leaving in caskets , '' one trader said . </s>
<s> The SEC 's Mr. Breeden said the after-hours trading on the Midwest exchange would help the U.S. win back business that has moved overseas to conduct after-hours trades . </s>
