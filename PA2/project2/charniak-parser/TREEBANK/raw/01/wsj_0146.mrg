<s> Rep. John Dingell , an important sponsor of President Bush 's clean-air bill , plans to unveil a surprise proposal that would break with the White House on a centerpiece issue : acid rain . </s>
<s> The Michigan Democrat 's proposal , which is expected today , is described by government sources and lobbyists as significantly weaker than the Bush administration 's plan to cut utility emissions that lead to acid rain . </s>
<s> The administration 's plan could cost utilities , mainly those that use coal , up to $ 4 billion a year . </s>
<s> The proposal comes as a surprise even to administration officials and temporarily throws into chaos the House 's work on clean-air legislation . </s>
<s> As chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee , Mr. Dingell has almost single-handed control over clean-air legislation . </s>
<s> People close to the utility industry said Mr. Dingell 's proposal appears to guarantee only an estimated seven-million-ton cut in annual sulfur-dioxide emissions that lead to acid rain , though additional cuts could be ordered later . </s>
<s> Mr. Bush 's legislative package promises to cut emissions by 10 million tons -- basically in half -- by the year 2000 . </s>
<s> Although final details were n't available , sources said the Dingell plan would abandon the president 's proposal for a cap on utilities ' sulfur-dioxide emissions . </s>
<s> That proposal had been hailed by environmentalists but despised by utilities because they feared it would limit their growth . </s>
<s> It also would junk an innovative market-based system for trading emissions credits among polluters . </s>
<s> In addition , it is believed to offer a cost-sharing mechanism that would help subsidize the clean-up costs for the dirtiest coal-fired utilities in the country , sparing their customers from exorbitant jumps in their electric bills . </s>
<s> The administration , sticking to its vow of avoiding tax increases , has staunchly opposed cost-sharing . </s>
<s> Mr. Dingell 's staff was expected to present its acid-rain alternative to other committee members , apparently in an attempt to appease Midwestern lawmakers from high-polluting states who insist on cost-sharing . </s>
<s> It is n't clear , however , whether support for the proposal will be broad enough to pose a serious challenge to the White House 's acid-rain plan . </s>
<s> While the new proposal might appeal to the dirtiest utilities , it might not win the support of utilities , many in the West , that already have added expensive cleanup equipment or burn cleaner-burning fuels . </s>
<s> Lawmakers representing some of the cleaner utilities have been quietly working with the White House to devise ways to tinker with the administration bill to address their acid-rain concerns . </s>
