<s> Beauty Takes Backseat To Safety on Bridges </s>
<s> EVERYONE AGREES that most of the nation 's old bridges need to be repaired or replaced . </s>
<s> But there 's disagreement over how to do it . </s>
<s> Highway officials insist the ornamental railings on older bridges are n't strong enough to prevent vehicles from crashing through . </s>
<s> But other people do n't want to lose the bridges ' beautiful , sometimes historic , features . </s>
<s> `` The primary purpose of a railing is to contain a vehicle and not to provide a scenic view , '' says Jack White , a planner with the Indiana Highway Department . </s>
<s> He and others prefer to install railings such as the `` type F safety shape , '' a four-foot-high concrete slab with no openings . </s>
<s> In Richmond , Ind. , the type F railing is being used to replace arched openings on the G Street Bridge . </s>
<s> Garret Boone , who teaches art at Earlham College , calls the new structure `` just an ugly bridge '' and one that blocks the view of a new park below . </s>
<s> In Hartford , Conn. , the Charter Oak Bridge will soon be replaced , the cast-iron medallions from its railings relegated to a park . </s>
<s> Compromises are possible . </s>
<s> Citizens in Peninsula , Ohio , upset over changes to a bridge , negotiated a deal : The bottom half of the railing will be type F , while the top half will have the old bridge 's floral pattern . </s>
<s> Similarly , highway engineers agreed to keep the old railings on the Key Bridge in Washington , D.C. , as long as they could install a crash barrier between the sidewalk and the road . </s>
<s> Tray Bon ? </s>
<s> Drink Carrier Competes With Cartons </s>
<s> PORTING POTABLES just got easier , or so claims Scypher Corp. , the maker of the Cup-Tote . </s>
<s> The Chicago company 's beverage carrier , meant to replace cardboard trays at concession stands and fast-food outlets , resembles the plastic loops used on six-packs of beer , only the loops hang from a web of strings . </s>
<s> The new carrier can tote as many as four cups at once . </s>
<s> Inventor Claire Marvin says his design virtually eliminates spilling . </s>
<s> Lids are n't even needed . </s>
<s> He also claims the carrier costs less and takes up less space than most paper carriers . </s>
<s> A few fast-food outlets are giving it a try . </s>
<s> The company acknowledges some problems . </s>
<s> A driver has to find something to hang the carrier on , so the company supplies a window hook . </s>
<s> While it breaks down in prolonged sunlight , it is n't recyclable . </s>
<s> And unlike some trays , there 's no place for food . </s>
<s> Spirit of Perestroika Touches Design World </s>
<s> AN EXCHANGE of U.S. and Soviet designers promises change on both sides . </s>
<s> An exhibition of American design and architecture opened in September in Moscow and will travel to eight other Soviet cities . </s>
<s> The show runs the gamut , from a blender to chairs to a model of the Citicorp building . </s>
<s> The event continues into next year and includes an exchange program to swap design teachers at Carnegie-Mellon and Leningrad 's Mutchin Institute . </s>
<s> Dan Droz , leader of the Carnegie-Mellon group , sees benefits all around . </s>
<s> The Soviets , who normally have few clients other than the state , will get `` exposure to a market system , '' he says . </s>
<s> Americans will learn more about making products for the Soviets . </s>
<s> Mr. Droz says the Soviets could even help U.S. designers renew their sense of purpose . </s>
<s> `` In Moscow , they kept asking us things like , ` Why do you make 15 different corkscrews , when all you need is one good one ? ' '' he says . </s>
<s> `` They got us thinking maybe we should be helping U.S. companies improve existing products rather than always developing new ones . '' </s>
<s> Seed for Jail Solution Fails to Take Root </s>
<s> IT 'S A TWO BIRDS with one stone deal : Eggers Group architects propose using grain elevators to house prisoners . </s>
<s> It would ease jail overcrowding while preserving historic structures , the company says . </s>
<s> But New York state , which is seeking solutions to its prison cell shortage , says `` no . '' </s>
<s> Grain elevators built in the 1920s and '30s have six-inch concrete walls and a tubular shape that would easily contain semicircular cells with a control point in the middle , the New York firm says . </s>
<s> Many are far enough from residential areas to pass public muster , yet close enough to permit family visits . </s>
<s> Besides , Eggers says , grain elevators are worth preserving for aesthetic reasons -- one famed architect compared them to the pyramids of Egypt . </s>
<s> A number of cities -- including Minneapolis , Philadelphia and Houston -- have vacant grain elevators , Eggers says . </s>
<s> A medium-sized one in Brooklyn , it says , could be altered to house up to 1,000 inmates at a lower cost than building a new prison in upstate New York . </s>
<s> A spokesman for the state , however , calls the idea `` not effective or cost efficient . </s>
