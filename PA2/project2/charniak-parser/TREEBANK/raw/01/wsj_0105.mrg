<s> Your Oct. 6 editorial `` The Ill Homeless '' referred to research by us and six of our colleagues that was reported in the Sept. 8 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association . </s>
<s> Your comments implied we had discovered that the `` principal cause '' of homelessness is to be found in the large numbers of mentally ill and substance-abusing people in the homeless population . </s>
<s> We have made no such statement . </s>
<s> It is clear that most mentally ill people and most alcoholics do not become homeless . </s>
<s> The `` causes '' of homelessness are poorly understood and complex in any individual case . </s>
<s> In quoting from our research you emphasized the high prevalance of mental illness and alcoholism . </s>
<s> You did not note that the homeless people we examined had a multitude of physical disorders in addition to their psychiatric problems and substance abuse . </s>
<s> They suffered from malnutrition , chest diseases , cardiovascular disorders , skin problems , infectious diseases and the aftereffects of assaults and rape . </s>
<s> Homeless people not only lack safety , privacy and shelter , they also lack the elementary necessities of nutrition , cleanliness and basic health care . </s>
<s> In a recent report , the Institute of Medicine pointed out that certain health problems may predispose a person to homelessness , others may be a consequence of it , and a third category is composed of disorders whose treatment is difficult or impossible if a person lacks adequate shelter . </s>
<s> The interactions between health and homelessness are complex , defying sweeping generalizations as to `` cause '' or `` effect . '' </s>
<s> If we look to the future , preventing homelessness is an important objective . </s>
<s> This will require us to develop a much more sophisticated understanding of the dynamics of homelessness than we currently possess , an understanding that can be developed only through careful study and research . </s>

<s> A study by Tulane Prof. James Wright says homelessness is due to a complex array of problems , with the common thread of poverty . </s>
<s> The study shows that nearly 40 % of the homeless population is made up of women and children and that only 25 % of the homeless exhibits some combination of drug , alcohol and mental problems . </s>
<s> According to Dr. Wright , homelessness is `` simultaneously a housing problem , an employment problem , a demographic problem , a problem of social disaffiliation , a mental health problem , a family violence problem , a problem created by the cutbacks in social welfare spending , a problem resulting from the decay of the traditional nuclear family , and a problem intimately connected to the recent increase in the number of persons living below the poverty level .

<s> To quote the highly regarded director of a privately funded drop-in center for the homeless in New York : `` If you 're homeless , you do n't sleep for fear of being robbed or murdered . </s>
<s> After your first three weeks of sleep deprivation , you 're scarcely in touch with reality any more ; without psychiatric treatment , you may well be unable to fend for yourself ever again . '' </s>
<s> Some of the homeless , obviously , had pre-existing mental illness or addiction . </s>
<s> But many others have fallen through cracks in the economy into the grim , brutal world of our city streets . </s>
<s> Once there , what ways of escape are open to them other than drink , drugs or insanity ? </s>
<s> Maxwell R.D. Vos Brooklyn , N.Y . </s>
<s> You dismiss as `` sentimental '' the view that the reduction of federal housing-assistance programs by 77 % might have played a significant role in the increased number of men and women sleeping on our city streets during the Reagan-Bush years . </s>
<s> There is no sign that you bothered to consider the inverse of your logic : namely , that mental illness and substance abuse might be to some degree consequences rather than causes of homelessness . </s>
<s> Your research stopped when a convenient assertion could be made . </s>
<s> Robert S. Jenkins Cambridge , Mass . </s>
<s> Of the approximately 200 sponsors of the recent march in Washington for the homeless , you chose to cite such groups as the National Association of Home Builders and the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen , insinuating that the march got its major support from self-serving groups that `` know a good thing when they see it , '' and that the crusade was based on greed or the profit motive . </s>
<s> But is n't the desire for profit the driving force behind those who subscribe to , and advertise in , your paper ? </s>
<s> Why did n't you mention the YMCA or the YWCA or Catholic Charities USA or a hundred other nonprofit organizations that participated in the march ? </s>
<s> As for the findings on the 203 Baltimore homeless who underwent psychiatric examinations , I suggest you conduct your own survey . </s>
<s> Choose 203 business executives , including , perhaps , someone from your own staff , and put them out on the streets , to be deprived for one month of their homes , families and income . </s>
<s> I would predict that within a short time most of them would find Thunderbird a satisfactory substitute for Chivas Regal and that their `` normal '' phobias , anxieties , depressions and substance abuse would increase dramatically . </s>
