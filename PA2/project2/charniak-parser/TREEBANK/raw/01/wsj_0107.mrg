<s> The House passed legislation designed to make it easier for the Transportation Department to block airline leveraged buy-outs . </s>
<s> The final vote came after the House rejected Republican efforts to weaken the bill and approved two amendments sought by organized labor . </s>
<s> The Bush administration has threatened to veto such a bill because of what it views as an undesirable intrusion into the affairs of industry , but the 300-113 vote suggests that supporters have the potential to override a veto . </s>
<s> The broader question is where the Senate stands on the issue . </s>
<s> While the Senate Commerce Committee has approved legislation similar to the House bill on airline leveraged buy-outs , the measure has n't yet come to the full floor . </s>
<s> Although the legislation would apply to acquisitions involving any major airline , it is aimed at giving the Transportation Department the chance to review in advance transactions financed by large amounts of debt . </s>
<s> `` The purpose of the bill is to put the brakes on airline acquisitions that would so load a carrier up with debt that it would impede safety or a carrier 's ability to compete , '' Rep. John Paul Hammerschmidt , -LRB- R. , Ark . -RRB- said . </s>
<s> The bill , as it was approved by the House Public Works and Transportation Committee , would give the Transportation Department up to 50 days to review any purchase of 15 % or more of the stock in an airline . </s>
<s> The department would be required to block the buy-out if the acquisition is likely to financially weaken a carrier so that safety would be impaired ; its ability to compete would be sharply diminished ; it would be put into foreign control ; or if the transaction would result in the sale of airline-related assets -- unless selling such assets had an overriding public benefit . </s>
<s> The House approved an amendment offered by Rep. Peter DeFazio -LRB- D. , Ore. -RRB- that would , in addition to the previous criteria , also require the department to block the acquisition of an airline if the added debt incurred were likely to result in a reduction in the number of the carrier 's employees , or their wages or benefits . </s>
<s> Rep. James Traficant -LRB- D. , Ohio -RRB- , said the amendment , which passed 271-147 , would `` let the American worker know that we consider them occasionally . '' </s>
<s> But Rep. Hammerschmidt said that the provision , which he dubbed a `` special interest '' amendment , was likely to make the bill even more controversial . </s>
<s> On Tuesday , the House approved a labor-backed amendment that would require the Transportation Department to reject airline acquisitions if the person seeking to purchase a carrier had run two or more airlines previously that have filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code . </s>
<s> The provision , called the `` two-time-losers '' amendment by its supporters , apparently was aimed at preventing Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo from attempting to take over another airline . </s>
