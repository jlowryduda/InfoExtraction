<s> USX Corp. posted a 23 % drop in third-quarter profit , as improved oil results failed to offset weakness in steel and natural gas operations . </s>
<s> The nation 's largest steelmaker earned $ 175 million , or 62 cents a share , compared with the year-earlier $ 228 million , or 80 cents a share . </s>
<s> The recent quarter includes pretax gains of $ 98 million from asset sales , while like gains in the year-earlier quarter totaled $ 61 million . </s>
<s> In the 1988 period , USX also had a $ 71 million after-tax gain from a tax dispute settlement . </s>
<s> Sales rose 5 % to $ 4.4 billion from $ 4.2 billion . </s>
<s> The earnings drop appears particularly steep in comparison with last year 's unusually strong third quarter , when the company was riding an industrywide boom in demand and pricing . </s>
<s> However , third-quarter operating profit fell 14 % , as USX sold sizable chunks of its diversified and steel segments , eliminating income from those operations . </s>
<s> Among segments that continue to operate , though , the company 's steel division continued to suffer from soft demand for its tubular goods serving the oil industry and other markets . </s>
<s> Peter Marcus , an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. , said that a downturn in the appliance industry , coupled with sluggish automotive sales , hurt USX results . </s>
<s> Moreover , USX exports more than other steelmakers , and the overseas market has been under more severe pricing pressure . </s>
<s> The company attributed lower sales and earnings for the steel segment to the loss of results from the Lorain , Ohio , plant , which now is a 50-50 joint venture with Japan 's Kobe Steel Ltd . </s>
<s> In the steel division , operating profit dropped 11 % to $ 85 million . </s>
<s> Profit per ton of steel shipped dropped to about $ 33 a ton from $ 42 a ton last year and $ 53 a ton in the second quarter , analysts said . </s>
<s> Still , USX fared better than other major steelmakers , earning more per ton of steel shipped than either Bethlehem Steel Corp. , which posted a 54 % drop in net income , or Inland Steel Industries Inc. , whose profit plummeted 70 % . </s>
<s> In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , USX shares closed up $ 1.25 , at $ 34.625 , as the reported earnings exceeded projections by some analysts who had n't expected as great a volume of asset sales . </s>
<s> The rise in the stock 's price may also reflect the fact that USX 's steel segment fared better than some other steelmakers ' . </s>
<s> Charles Bradford , an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets , said USX may have received orders lost by competitors who were involved in labor contracts earlier this year . </s>
<s> He said USX also appeared to sell a richer mix of steel products , such as the more profitable pipe and galvanized coated sheet , than lower-priced structural goods . </s>
<s> The energy segment , with a 15 % rise in operating profit , is clearly the company 's strongest . </s>
<s> Higher crude oil prices helped boost operating profit for the Marathon Oil Co. unit to $ 198 million from $ 180 million . </s>

<s> USX announced in October that it was soliciting bids to sell TXO 's oil and gas reserves . </s>
<s> Proceeds of that sale are to be used to reduce debt and buy back shares . </s>
