<s> Robert L. Bernstein , chairman and president of Random House Inc. , announced his resignation from the publishing house he has run for 23 years . </s>
<s> A successor was n't named , which fueled speculation that Mr. Bernstein may have clashed with S.I. Newhouse Jr. , whose family company , Advance Publications Inc. , owns Random House . </s>
<s> Abrupt departures are n't unheard of within the Newhouse empire . </s>
<s> In an interview , Mr. Bernstein said his departure `` evolved out of discussions with Si Newhouse and that 's the decision I reached . '' </s>
<s> He declined to elaborate , other than to say , `` It just seemed the right thing to do at this minute . </s>
<s> Sometimes you just go with your gut . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Bernstein said he will stay until Dec. 31 and work with his successor , who is to be named soon . </s>
<s> Mr. Newhouse , meanwhile , insisted that he is n't unhappy with Mr. Bernstein or the performance of Random House , the largest trade publishing house in the U.S. . </s>
<s> The company said the publisher 's annual sales volume increased to $ 800 million from $ 40 million during Mr. Bernstein 's tenure . </s>
<s> `` Bob has handled the extraordinary growth of the company quite brilliantly , '' said Mr. Newhouse . </s>
<s> `` The company is doing well , it 's stable , it 's got good people . </s>
<s> Bob has an agenda and this seemed like the natural time . '' </s>
<s> Publishing officials believe that while Random House has enjoyed spectacular growth and has smoothly integrated many acquisitions in recent years , some of the bigger ones have n't been absorbed so easily . </s>
<s> Crown Publishing Group , acquired last year , is said to be turning in disappointing results . </s>
<s> As a private company , Random House does n't report its earnings . </s>
<s> Mr. Bernstein , who succeeded Bennett Cerf , has been only the second president of Random House since it was founded in 1925 . </s>
<s> Speculation on his successor centers on a number of division heads at the house . </s>
<s> Possible candidates include Susan Petersen , president of Ballantine\/Del Rey\/Fawcett , Random House 's huge and successful paperback division . </s>
<s> Some say Anthony Cheetham , head of a recently acquired British company , Century Hutchinson , could be chosen . </s>
<s> There is also speculation that Mr. Newhouse could bring in a powerhouse businessman or another Newhouse family member to run the business side , in combination with a publishing executive like Robert Gottlieb , who left Random House 's Alfred A. Knopf to run the New Yorker , also owned by the Newhouse family . </s>
<s> Not included on the most-likely-successor list are Joni Evans , recruited two years ago to be publisher of adult trade books for Random House , and Sonny Mehta , president of the prestigious Alfred A. Knopf unit . </s>
<s> When Ms. Evans took her job , several important divisions that had reported to her predecessor were n't included partly because she did n't wish to be a full-time administrator . </s>
<s> Mr. Mehta is widely viewed as a brilliant editor but a less-than-brilliant administrator and his own departure was rumored recently . </s>
<s> Mr. Bernstein , a tall , energetic man who is widely respected as a publishing executive , has spent much of his time in recent years on human rights issues . </s>
