<s> New York financier Saul Steinberg sought federal permission to buy more than 15 % of United Airlines ' parent , UAL Corp. , saying he might seek control of the nation 's second-largest airline . </s>
<s> Although takeover experts said they doubted Mr. Steinberg will make a bid by himself , the application by his Reliance Group Holdings Inc. could signal his interest in helping revive a failed labor-management bid . </s>
<s> Such an application for federal antitrust clearance is necessary for any investor that might seek control . </s>
<s> But some investors have used such filings to boost the value of their stock holdings , which -- without buying more stock -- they then sold . </s>
<s> Takeover stock traders were puzzled by the Reliance filing and cautioned that it does n't mean Mr. Steinberg will definitely seek control . </s>
<s> `` Maybe he just wants to make something happen , '' said one takeover expert . </s>
<s> One investment banker said Mr. Steinberg may be trying to position himself as a friendly investor who could help UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf revive a failed labor-management bid . </s>
<s> Mr. Steinberg , he suggested , could replace British Airways PLC , which has withdrawn from the buy-out group . </s>
<s> Reliance had already bought and sold UAL stock at a big profit without making an antitrust filing before the collapse Oct. 13 of the $ 6.79 billion , $ 300-a-share labor-management buy-out . </s>
<s> Reliance acquired a 7 % UAL stake early this year at an average cost of $ 110 a share , and reduced its stake to 4.7 % after UAL accepted the bid at prices higher than $ 282 a share . </s>
<s> Market sources said Reliance has already sold its entire UAL stake , and thus would n't have any reason to file the application simply to boost the value of its stock . </s>
<s> But the exact amount of Reliance 's current holding has n't been formally disclosed . </s>
<s> The filing adds a new twist to market speculation that Coniston Partners , a New York money manager , has bought more than 5 % of UAL stock and may challenge the UAL board 's decision last week to remain independent . </s>
<s> Speculation about Coniston has caused the stock to rebound from a low of $ 145 . </s>
<s> UAL 's announcement came after the market closed yesterday . </s>
<s> In composite New York Stock Exchange trading , the shares closed at $ 177 , up $ 1.50 . </s>
<s> UAL would n't elaborate on a statement that it had been notified of the filing by Reliance . </s>
<s> Reliance confirmed the filing but would n't elaborate . </s>
<s> Some takeover experts were skeptical , saying it was possible that Mr. Steinberg made the filing only to help boost the value of any remaining Reliance stake in UAL . </s>
<s> Mr. Steinberg is thought to be on friendly terms with UAL 's Mr. Wolf . </s>
<s> The investor was instrumental in tapping Mr. Wolf to run the air cargo unit of Tiger International Inc . </s>
<s> Mr. Wolf 's success in that job helped him land the top job with UAL in December 1987 . </s>
<s> But any potential acquirer must attempt to reach some kind of accord with the company 's employees , primarily its pilots and the powerful machinists ' union , which has opposed a takeover . </s>
