<s> An arbitrator awarded Eastern Airlines pilots between $ 60 million and $ 100 million in back pay , a decision that could complicate the carrier 's bankruptcy-law reorganization . </s>
<s> Eastern , a unit of Texas Air Corp. , said it is examining the ruling to determine if it can appeal . </s>
<s> It 's unclear whether Eastern will succeed in overturning the arbitrator 's decision , made in a long-simmering `` pay parity '' dispute that predates both the carrier 's Chapter 11 petition and its 1986 acquisition by Texas Air . </s>
<s> All Eastern 's previous court efforts to head off the pilots ' demands have failed . </s>
<s> An Eastern spokesman said he does n't expect that the arbitrator 's ruling `` will have any overall material effect on the company 's strategic plan . '' </s>
<s> Bankruptcy experts said the law is n't clear on how such an arbitration ruling can affect a company 's case . </s>
<s> Like any other creditor , the pilots will have to apply to the court for payment of their claim . </s>
<s> That may leave a lot of leeway for U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland to decide what , if anything , the pilots actually collect . </s>
<s> In August , he issued the ruling that let the pilots pursue their back-pay grievance before the arbitrator . </s>
<s> The pilots ' contract with Eastern calls for a mutually acceptable private arbitrator to resolve such grievances . </s>
<s> In a statement to employees , Eastern said the company was disappointed by the ruling . </s>
<s> `` The obligation is totally unwarranted , '' the statement said . </s>
<s> James Linsey , a lawyer for the Air Line Pilots Association , said the pilots were extremely pleased . </s>
<s> `` This is a blow not only to Eastern but to the creditors committee , '' he said . </s>
<s> Eastern 's creditors committee , along with the company , has consistently opposed the pilots ' claim , which if paid would have to come out of money both hope to use to pay off other bankruptcy claims . </s>
<s> Eastern and its creditors are in the final , delicate stages of negotiating a second reorganization plan to pay off the airline 's debts . </s>
<s> An earlier plan , which had received the creditors ' approval in July , fell apart when Eastern changed its business plan . </s>
<s> It is n't known whether the pilot claim was figured into either plan . </s>
<s> The dispute between Eastern and its pilots is over a `` pay parity '' clause in the pilots ' contract . </s>
<s> The clause was part of an agreement in which pilots accepted a substantial pay cut as long as no other labor group got a raise . </s>
<s> Shortly after Texas Air took control of Eastern , some Machinists union supervisors received a 20 % pay raise . </s>
<s> The pilots argued that this triggered a pay raise for them . </s>
<s> Eastern has disputed the claim , but a federal district court , an appeals court and now the arbitrator have all sided with the pilots . </s>
<s> The two sides do n't even agree about how much money is at issue . </s>
<s> The pilots put the amount as high as $ 100 million , the company at $ 65 million . </s>
<s> Another arbitrator is hearing another pay parity case between Eastern and its pilots , resulting from a similar set of circumstances involving a separate pay raise granted another union . </s>
<s> A decision on that case is n't expected before mid-November . </s>
<s> Ironically , many of the pilots involved have left Eastern or are still striking the carrier , which filed for bankruptcy protection March 9 . </s>
<s> About 800 have crossed the picket lines and returned to work . </s>
