<s> As Yogi Berra might say , it 's deja vu all over again . </s>
<s> Crouched at shortstop , Bert Campaneris , once Oakland 's master thief , effortlessly scoops up a groundball and flips it to second . </s>
<s> In the outfield , Paul Blair , the Orioles ' eight-time Gold Glove winner , elegantly shags a fly . </s>
<s> On the mound , former Red Sox great Luis Tiant , the wily master of 1,001 moves , throws an off-speed strike . </s>
<s> `` Babies , kiddies , '' growls their manager -- a fellow named Earl Weaver , who , in a different time , handled four World Series teams and now handles the Gold Coast Suns . </s>
<s> `` Old-time kiddies , '' he says . </s>
<s> Perhaps . </s>
<s> But for the next few months , these boys of summers long past are going to be reveling in an Indian summer of the soul . </s>
<s> Now that the baseball season is officially over , you see , it 's time for a new season to begin . </s>
<s> Today is the debut of the Senior Professional Baseball Association , a new eight-team pro sports circuit , modeled after the highly successful senior tennis and golf tours and complete with good salaries , a cable television contract and even expansion plans . </s>
<s> One hundred and ninety two former greats , near greats , hardly knowns and unknowns begin a 72-game , three-month season in spring-training stadiums up and down Florida . </s>
<s> For everyone involved , it 's one more swig of that elixir of youth , baseball . </s>
<s> `` Someone always makes you quit , '' says legendary St. Louis Cardinals centerfielder Curt Flood , the league 's commissioner . </s>
<s> `` You feel you want one more -- one more at-bat , one more hit , one more game . '' </s>
<s> Until the baby-faced heroes of today reclaim these ballparks for spring training , there is one more . </s>
<s> And not just for the players . </s>
<s> It 's one more for the baseball-loving lawyers , accountants and real estate developers who ponied up about $ 1 million each for the chance to be an owner , to step into the shoes of a Gene Autry or have a beer with Rollie Fingers . </s>
<s> `` Nothing can be better than this , '' says Don Sider , owner of the West Palm Beach Tropics . </s>
<s> Early in the morning Mr. Sider , an estate lawyer , pores over last wills and testaments . </s>
<s> Midmorning , he dons an orange-and-blue uniform and , for fun , may field a bunt from Dave Kingman . </s>
<s> It 's one more , too , for the fans who dream of a season that never ends . </s>
<s> `` I feel like a little kid , '' says a gleeful Alex de Castro , a car salesman , who has stopped by a workout of the Suns to slip six Campaneris cards to the Great Man Himself to be autographed . </s>
<s> The league 's promoters hope retirees and tourists will join die-hard fans like Mr. de Castro and pack the stands to see the seniors . </s>
<s> The league is the brainchild of Colorado real estate developer James Morley -- once a minor-leaguer himself -- who says he had the idea last January while lying on a beach in Australia . </s>
<s> When he sent letters offering 1,250 retired major leaguers the chance of another season , 730 responded . </s>
<s> Eventually , about 250 made the trip to Florida to compete for the available slots . </s>
<s> -LRB- Players have to be 35 or older , except for catchers , who are eligible at 32 because life behind the plate is so rough . -RRB- </s>
<s> For some players , the lure is money -- up to $ 15,000 a month . </s>
<s> Others , just released from the majors , hope the senior league will be their bridge back into the big-time . </s>
<s> But as they hurl fireballs that smolder rather than burn , and relive old duels in the sun , it 's clear that most are there to make their fans cheer again or recapture the camaraderie of seasons past or prove to themselves and their colleagues that they still have it -- or something close to it . </s>
<s> `` My fastball is good . </s>
<s> Real good , '' says 39-year-old Pete Broberg , working in the midday heat of the Tropics camp . </s>
<s> Mr. Broberg , who started with the now-defunct Washington Senators , says that when he left baseball in 1978 , he `` never looked back . '' </s>
<s> For a long time , he ignored baseball altogether , even the sports pages . </s>
<s> Now Mr. Broberg , a lawyer , claims he 'd play for free . </s>
<s> `` You ca n't give it up that easily , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` I tried . '' </s>
<s> The nagging memory of one afternoon fourteen years ago drove Jim Gideon , a lean 36-year-old righthander to take a four-month leave from selling insurance in Texas to try out for Mr. Weaver 's team . </s>
<s> `` It does n't replace pitching in the majors , but it proves to me that I would have been able to play if I 'd stayed healthy , '' he says . </s>
<s> Back in 1975 , late in the season , a then-21 Mr. Gideon made his only major league appearance , five and two-thirds innings for the Texas Rangers against the Chicago White Sox . </s>
<s> He gave up seven hits , walked five and did n't get a decision . </s>
<s> Arm troubles forced him back to the minors the next year . </s>
<s> `` There 's a satisfaction in going against the rules , '' offers Will McEnaney , once a stopper with Cincinnati 's Big Red Machine . </s>
<s> He means the rule that a player ca n't cut it after a certain age . </s>
<s> These days he hustles to house-painting jobs in his Chevy pickup before and after training with the Tropics . </s>
<s> While sipping a beer after practice , he vividly recounts getting the Red Sox 's Carl Yastrzemski to pop out to end the 1975 World Series , and repeating the feat against the Yankees ' Roy White in 1976 . </s>
<s> Some of the game 's reigning philosophers dislike the idea of middle-aged men attempting a young man 's sport . </s>
<s> `` I personally do n't enjoy seeing players who I remember vividly from their playing days running about and being gallant about their deficiencies , '' says Roger Angell , New Yorker magazine 's resident baseball sage . </s>
<s> `` I feel people should be allowed to remember players as they were . '' </s>
<s> Worse , says baseball author Lawrence Ritter , `` Someone will get a heart attack and that will be the end of the whole story . '' </s>
<s> But the ballplayers disagree . </s>
<s> Most are trim . </s>
<s> Some have been training for months ; others only recently left active status . </s>
<s> -LRB- No one has worked out the players ' average age , but most appear to be in their late 30s . -RRB- </s>
<s> And there 's pride . </s>
<s> `` I 'm not going to look stupid , '' vows former Pittsburgh Pirate second baseman Rennie Stennett , sweat dotting his brow as he prepares for some practice swings . </s>
<s> `` It 's going to be a tough league , '' promises the 47-year-old Mr. Campaneris . </s>
<s> `` There will be a lot of malice . '' </s>
<s> Men who have played hard all their lives are n't about to change their habits , he says . </s>
<s> Nonetheless , one ca n't help wonder whether the game will be just a little bit slower . </s>
<s> At the weatherbeaten Pompano Beach municipal stadium , Mr. Blair , the 45-year-old former Oriole , knows his power is n't what it used to be . </s>
<s> So he adjusts . </s>
<s> He no longer crowds the plate . </s>
<s> He 's not thinking about home runs anymore , just base hits . </s>
<s> Still , `` how sweet it is , '' he says , savoring the fat sound of the well-hit line drive that bounces off the center field wall . </s>
<s> And do n't expect many complete games by pitchers -- perhaps three out of 288 , laughs Mr. Fingers , the former Oakland reliever . </s>
<s> Expect `` tricky '' stuff from pitchers , says Mr. Weaver , the manager . </s>
<s> Expect brushbacks but no beanballs , says Mr. McEnaney . </s>
<s> Even expect stolen bases , says the wiry and fit Mr. Campaneris : `` If you know how to slide , it 's no problem , '' he says . </s>
<s> And expect slower fastballs . </s>
<s> `` I 'm not so young anymore , '' concedes the cigar-chomping , 48-year-old Mr. Tiant . </s>
<s> `` I wo n't be throwing 90 mph , but I will throw 80-plus , '' he says . </s>
<s> White-haired Pedro Ramos , at 54 the league 's oldest player and a pitcher-coach with the Suns , has lost even more speed . </s>
<s> Stuffing a wad of Red Man into his cheek , he admits the fastball he brought into the majors in 1955 has become a slowball . </s>
<s> Its maximum velocity is 72 mph . </s>
<s> But he is n't worried . </s>
<s> He will compensate with the guile learned from his years in the majors . </s>
<s> He has good control . </s>
<s> He will keep the ball down , move it around . </s>
<s> After all , he says , `` Even to make love , you need experience . </s>
