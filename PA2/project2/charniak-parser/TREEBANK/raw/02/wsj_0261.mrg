<s> Now was that a quarter cup or a half cup ? </s>
<s> Not a gripping question , unless you 're the pastry chef of this city 's Chez Panisse restaurant and you 've just lost your priceless personal dessert notebook . </s>
<s> Chez Panisse was listed among the top 30 restaurants in the world this year by Connoisseur magazine . </s>
<s> The tattered black binder , bulging with 18 years ' worth of recipes held together by rubber bands , was in chef Lindsey Shere 's purse when it was stolen from her house recently . </s>
<s> The Berkeley police do n't have any leads but doubt the crime was driven by a passion for sweets . </s>
<s> Instead , they figure the culprit probably took money from Ms. Shere 's wallet and discarded all the tips in the five-by-eight-inch looseleaf . </s>
<s> Chez Panisse , whose founder , Alice Waters , is considered the inventor of the cooking style known as California cuisine and whose patrons make reservations a month in advance , has n't exactly subjected diners to vanilla ice cream because of the theft . </s>
<s> For one thing , Ms. Shere can draw on her cookbook , published by Random House four years ago , which is teeming with recipes for such specialties as kiwi sherbet , gooseberry fool -LRB- a creamy dish made with crushed stewed berries -RRB- and hazelnut `` oeufs a la neige . '' </s>
<s> For another , sympathetic fans have sent Ms. Shere copies of her recipes clipped from magazines over the years . </s>
<s> Still , the restaurant 's ever-changing menu of five-course dinners -- it supposedly has n't repeated a meal since opening in 1971 -- requires constant improvisation . </s>
<s> And that puts added pressure on Chez Panisse dessert-menu planners . </s>
<s> `` We make what we know how to make , '' says business manager Richard Mazzera . </s>
<s> Many in the Bay Area 's pastry community express disbelief that Ms. Shere kept only one copy of such valuable notes , but she has received moral support from Baker 's Dozen , a group of California pastry chefs that meets regularly to discuss issues like how to keep meringues from weeping and how bovine eating habits affect butter texture . </s>
<s> Ms. Shere has offered a $ 500 reward for the book 's return but figures she 'll have to reinvent many recipes from scratch . </s>
<s> `` It 's an overwhelming job , '' she says . </s>
<s> `` There are so many possible proportions when you consider how many things are made out of eggs and butter and milk . </s>
