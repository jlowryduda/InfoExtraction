<s> Healthcare International Inc. said it reached a 120-day standstill agreement with its HealthVest affiliate calling for Healthcare to pay HealthVest $ 5 million right away and additional amounts in the future . </s>
<s> Under the agreement , Healthcare , a manager of health-care facilities , said it would pay HealthVest $ 3.9 million in overdue rent and mortgage payments and repay $ 1.1 million in funds that HealthVest advanced for construction work on facilities . </s>
<s> In return , HealthVest agreed that it wo n't exercise its rights and remedies against Healthcare during the 120-day period . </s>
<s> After the payment , Healthcare still will be $ 6.5 million in arrears on rent and mortgage payments to HealthVest , a real estate investment trust whose portfolio consists largely of properties operated by Healthcare . </s>
<s> Healthcare has given HealthVest a 12 % note for that overdue amount , to be repaid over three years . </s>
<s> In addition , Healthcare agreed to make monthly rent and mortgage payments of $ 2.7 million to $ 3 million to HealthVest during the standstill period , to be paid when Healthcare successfully completes asset sales . </s>
<s> Because Healthcare actually owes HealthVest $ 4.2 million in rent and mortgage payments each month , the amount due above the amount paid will be added to the three-year note . </s>
<s> The funds should help ease a cash bind at HealthVest , which has been unable to pay its debts because Healthcare has n't made complete rent and mortgage payments since July . </s>
<s> A spokesman said HealthVest has paid two of the three banks it owed interest to in October and is in negotiations with the third bank . </s>
<s> Healthcare , which has been in a severe liquidity bind , said it is able to make the payments because it completed a transaction with Greenery Rehabilitation Group Inc. in which Greenery purchased stock and warrants for $ 500,000 and loaned Healthcare $ 9 million . </s>
<s> The loan is backed by Healthcare 's 5.4 % stake in HealthVest and interest in certain facilities . </s>
