<s> Few people in the advertising business have raised as many hackles as Alvin A. Achenbaum . </s>
<s> The general public may not know his name , but he 's famous -- make that infamous -- in advertising circles : A marketing consultant , he pioneered slashing ad agency commissions , to the delight of advertising clients and the dismay of agencies . </s>
<s> Now , after beating them , Mr. Achenbaum is joining them . </s>
<s> Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide named Mr. Achenbaum , 62 , vice chairman of professional services , reporting directly to Carl Spielvogel , chairman and chief executive officer . </s>
<s> He joins Nov. 13 , dissolving his consulting firm , Canter , Achenbaum Associates . </s>
<s> In years past , the ad industry 's most distinguished executives did n't hesitate to excorciate Mr. Achenbaum . </s>
<s> They have since mellowed , although one senior Young & Rubicam executive , echoing others , said : `` I think ad agencies owe Carl -LCB- Spielvogel -RCB- a vote of thanks for getting him out of the consulting business . '' </s>
<s> But industry executives also believe hiring Mr. Achenbaum is a shrewd move for Backer Spielvogel , a unit of Saatchi & Saatchi . </s>
<s> Mr. Achenbaum has counted among his clients some of the most visible blue-chip advertisers in the country , including Nissan , Toyota , Seagram and Backer Spielvogel clients Hyundai and J.P. Morgan . </s>
<s> At Backer Spielvogel , he will work with clients and potential clients on marketing strategies ; aside from agency compensation issues , he helped Nissan , for example , come up with its positioning and pricing for its new Infiniti line . </s>
<s> His client contacts , meanwhile , could prove a gold mine for an agency that has had few new business wins of late . </s>
<s> `` I 've done over 40 ad agency searches -LCB- for clients -RCB- , so I have a pretty good notion of what clients are interested in when they look for an agency , '' Mr. Achenbaum said . </s>
<s> As a consultant , he has given seminars at agencies including Ogilvy & Mather on how to win new business . </s>
<s> Mr. Spielvogel said he hopes Mr. Achenbaum will do some strategic consulting at the agency for `` non-clients , in hopes that they become clients . '' </s>
<s> At Backer Spielvogel , Mr. Spielvogel 's hallmark has been personal involvement with all major clients . </s>
<s> He pampers them ; he invites them to fabulous parties ; he strokes them . </s>
<s> Mr. Achenbaum , too , delves into his clients ' business . </s>
<s> `` Carl has a much higher degree of intimacy with his clients than is ordinary for an agency his size . </s>
<s> And with Al 's record of being a delver and a detail guy , you can see how the two fit , '' said Alan Gottesman , an analyst with PaineWebber . </s>
<s> Mr. Achenbaum 's move follows the announcement last month that his consulting partner , Stanley Canter , 66 , would retire . </s>
<s> When the announcement came out , `` I picked up the phone and said , ` Why do n't you come to us ? ' '' Mr. Spielvogel said . </s>
<s> Mr. Achenbaum , who had been considering paring down his firm or merging it with another small consulting outfit , soon agreed . </s>
<s> The two men are longtime friends and tennis partners , having met about 25 years ago . </s>
<s> Before becoming a consultant in 1974 , Mr. Achenbaum was a senior executive at J. Walter Thompson Co . </s>
<s> He spent most of his career formulating marketing strategies , but became best-known for chipping away at ad agency compensation . </s>
<s> Ad agencies typically earned a straight 15 % commission ; if a client spent $ 100 million on TV time , the agency made $ 15 million . </s>
<s> But Mr. Achenbaum pioneered negotiated fees , which often worked out to less than 15 % . </s>
<s> More recently , he negotiated `` indemnification '' clauses in which an ad agency in some cases must pay a client if it drops the account . </s>
<s> He ultimately became so well-known for cutting compensation , however , that clients did n't seek him out for anything else . </s>
<s> `` I was very frustrated , '' he said . </s>
<s> `` The fact of the matter is , I am a marketer . </s>
<s> That 's another reason -LCB- for the Backer Spielvogel job -RCB- . </s>
<s> It struck me as a way to get back to what I really want to do . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Spielvogel added pointedly : `` The pressure on commissions did n't begin with Al Achenbaum . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Spielvogel said Mr. Achenbaum will work with clients to determine the mix of promotion , merchandising , publicity and other marketing outlets , and to integrate those services . </s>
<s> He will concentrate on , among others , J.P. Morgan and Hyundai . </s>
<s> Mr. Achenbaum helped Morgan in its recent agency search , and he has a long relationship with Hyundai , which is having severe troubles , including declining sales . </s>
<s> `` The trail of revenue is increasingly going away from pure advertising , and going towards other services , '' Mr. Spielvogel said . </s>
<s> Instead of being just an ad agency , he said : `` We have redefined our mission here . </s>
<s> Our mission is to help our clients grow , and to use every tool of marketing communications to accomplish that . '' </s>
<s> Industry executives are wishing Mr. Achenbaum well . </s>
<s> Leonard Matthews , then-president of the American Association of Advertising Agencies , called Mr. Achenbaum a `` quisling '' in an incendiary 1987 speech . </s>
<s> Yesterday , Mr. Matthews , now a consultant with the Stamford , Conn. , firm Matthews & Johnston , quipped , `` I think he 'll be very good at that -LCB- new job -RCB- . </s>
<s> And much better at that than at -LCB- the price-cutting -RCB- he 's been doing recently . '' </s>
<s> Cotton Inc . Campaign </s>
<s> Cotton Inc. , the fiber company that represents cotton growers , will begin a new ad campaign , developed by Ogilvy & Mather , Thanksgiving Day . </s>
<s> J. Nicholas Hahn , Cotton Inc. 's president and chief executive , was an outspoken critic of WPP Group 's acquisition of Ogilvy Group earlier this year . </s>
<s> During the takeover , Mr. Hahn said he would put his account up for review if WPP 's bid were successful , but he did n't . </s>
<s> Cotton Inc. 's new $ 9 million campaign calls cotton the `` Fabric of Our Lives . '' </s>
<s> The campaign replaces its `` Take Comfort in Cotton '' ads and marks the end of its national cooperative advertising efforts . </s>
<s> For years , the company 's ads were tied in with pitches for Cannon sheets or Martex towels , for example , and an announcer at the end of the ads would tell customers where to `` find the true performance label . '' </s>
<s> With the new TV spots , Ogilvy & Mather has opted for a family style with lots of laughter , hugs and tears . </s>
<s> `` We 're making a fairly obvious plea for some emotional reaction , '' says Tom Rost , creative director at Ogilvy & Mather . </s>
<s> Cotton Inc. will spend nearly $ 2 million on broadcasting on Thanksgiving Day alone , advertising on such programs as `` Good Morning America , '' `` Macy 's Thanksgiving Day Parade '' and the NFL holiday game . </s>
<s> Frank Mingo Dies at 49 </s>
<s> Frank L. Mingo , one of the pioneers of advertising targeted at black audiences , died at the age of 49 after a stroke . </s>
<s> Mr. Mingo was chief executive officer of the Mingo Group , which he founded in 1977 and which created ads for the black market . </s>
<s> Clients include Miller Brewing Co. and General Motors . </s>
<s> Mr. Mingo was hospitalized Sept. 23 and died Monday , according to Samuel J. Chisholm , the agency 's president and chief operating officer . </s>

<s> Omnicom Group Inc. , New York , reported third-quarter net income rose 54 % to $ 5.6 million , or 22 cents a share , from $ 3.6 million , or 15 cents a share , a year earlier . </s>
<s> Revenue increased 20 % to $ 246.6 million from $ 204.8 million . </s>
