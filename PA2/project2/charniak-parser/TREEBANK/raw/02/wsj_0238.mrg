<s> Yields on savings-type certificates of deposit dropped slightly in the week ended yesterday . </s>
<s> The average yield on a six-month CD of $ 50,000 or less was 7.90 % , compared with 7.94 % a week earlier . </s>
<s> The average one-year savings-type CD was down to 7.99 % from 8.01 % , according to Banxquote Money Markets , a New York information service that tracks CD yields . </s>
<s> `` This week was uneventful for the CD market , '' said Norberto Mehl , chairman of Banxquote . </s>
<s> `` The major banks have n't even reacted to sharp rises in the three-month Treasury bill rates '' in the past two weeks . </s>
<s> Banks that adjusted payouts on CDs in the most recent week made only fractional moves , he said . </s>
<s> The CD trend runs counter to the direction of short-term interest rates at the Treasury bill auction Monday . </s>
<s> The average six-month bill was sold with a yield of 8.04 % , up from 7.90 % . </s>
<s> The average three-month issue rose to 8.05 % from 7.77 % . </s>
<s> Typically , banks offer CD yields higher than those on Treasury bills , which are considered the safest short-term investments ; banks need a competitive edge to sell their products . </s>
<s> But when market interest rates move up rapidly , increases in bank CD yields sometimes lag . </s>
<s> Most yields on short-term jumbo CDs , those with denominations over $ 90,000 , also moved in the opposite direction of Treasury bill yields . </s>
<s> The average six-month yield on a jumbo CD was at 7.90 % , down from 7.93 % , Banxquote said . </s>
<s> For longer-term CDs , yields were up . </s>
<s> The average two-year and five-year jumbos were up 0.02 of a percentage point to 7.91 % and 7.96 % , respectively . </s>
<s> However , CDs sold through major broker-dealer networks were up slightly almost across the board . </s>
<s> The average six-month CD in that category added 0.05 percentage point to 8.35 % , for example . </s>
<s> Mr. Mehl attributed the rise specifically to the Treasury bill increase . </s>
<s> Among the major banks surveyed by Banxquote in six regions of the country , 8.33 % is the highest yield available . </s>
<s> It is offered by the flagship banks of New York 's Manufacturers Hanover Corp. in the one-year maturity only . </s>
<s> The yield is offered across a range of maturities at San Francisco 's BankAmerica Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co . </s>
<s> Just two weeks ago , BankAmerica 's yields in many of those maturities was 8.61 % . </s>
<s> Still , on average , the major California banks have the highest yields on CDs , according to Banxquote . </s>
<s> The average yield there on six-month issues is 8.32 % . </s>
