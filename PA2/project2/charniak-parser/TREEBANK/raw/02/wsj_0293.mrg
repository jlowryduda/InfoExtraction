<s> INTENSIVE AUDITS are coming to 55,500 taxpayers as research guinea pigs . </s>
<s> This is the year : Unsuspecting filers of 1988 personal returns are being picked randomly for thorough audits to help the IRS update its criteria for enforcement , audit selection , and use of resources . </s>
<s> The last Taxpayer Compliance Measurement Program survey covered 1985 returns . </s>
<s> The 1988-return project starts Jan. 1 and is to be done by May 31 , 1991 . </s>
<s> Specially trained IRS agents will look for under-reported income and unsupported deductions and credits . </s>
<s> The agents will make more than routine inquiries about such items as marital status and dependents ; they want to look at living standards and business assets . </s>
<s> But they also are to see that taxpayers get all allowable tax benefits and to ask if filers who sought IRS aid were satisfied with it . </s>
<s> Courts have ruled that taxpayers must submit to TCMP audits , but the IRS will excuse from the fullscale rigors anyone who was audited without change for either 1986 or 1987 . </s>
<s> Rewards have been suggested -- but never adopted -- for filers who come through TCMP audits without change . </s>
<s> PENALTY OVERHAUL is still likely , congressional sources say . </s>
<s> Long-debated proposals to simplify the more than 150 civil penalties and make them fairer and easier to administer are in the House tax bill . </s>
<s> But they were stripped from the Senate bill after staffers estimated penalty revenue would fall by $ 216 million over five years . </s>
<s> Still , congressional aides say penalty reform is a strong candidate for enactment , even if not this time around , although some provisions may be modified . </s>
<s> Sen. Pryor -LRB- D. , Ark. -RRB- , a leader on the issue who generally backs the House plan , wants some changes -- for one , separate sanctions for negligence and large misstatements of tax owed , not a single penalty . </s>
<s> He would ease the proposed penalties for delayed payroll-tax deposits and for faulty Form 1099 and other reports that taxpayers correct voluntarily . </s>
<s> The General Accounting Office urges Congress to ensure that all penalties retain their force as deterrents . </s>
<s> TAXPAYERS ' RIGHTS are defined by a growing number of states . </s>
<s> The 1988 tax act created a federal bill of rights spelling out IRS duties to protect taxpayers ' rights in the assessment and collection of taxes . </s>
<s> States are following suit . </s>
<s> California enacted a rights law in 1988 . </s>
<s> In 1989 , Illinois , Kansas , Ohio , Oregon and South Carolina have adopted rights laws , the Federation of Tax Administrators , a state officials ' group , reports ; the features vary . </s>
<s> And taxpayer groups are urging legislation in many other states . </s>
<s> One group is the Committee on State Taxation , which comprises 330 multistate corporations and advises the Council of State Chambers of Commerce . </s>
<s> The group 's Mark Cahoon says its efforts begun in 1989 have led to the introduction of bills in Massachusetts , Minnesota and Colorado to establish evenhanded procedures affecting all kinds of taxpayers . </s>
<s> The group also seeks uniformity among states in provisions for taxpayers ' rights . </s>
<s> This week , New York City announced a 10-point policy patterned on the federal bill of rights for taxpayers . </s>
<s> THE MILEAGE RATE allowed for business use of a car in 1989 has risen to 25.5 cents a mile for the first 15,000 from 24 cents in 1988 , the IRS says ; the rate stays 11 cents for each added mile . </s>
<s> Also unaltered : 12 cents for charitable activities and nine cents for medical and moving costs . </s>
<s> IRA BALANCES could be used to qualify for bank services under a bill entered by Reps. Chandler -LRB- R. , Wash . -RRB- and Andrews -LRB- D. , Texas -RRB- . </s>
<s> The bill would thwart a recent Labor Department opinion that investing individual-retirement-account funds to earn free checking violates the law . </s>
<s> HUGO FELLED vast timberlands . </s>
<s> South Carolina 's congressional delegation has entered Senate and House bills to provide special casualty-loss treatment and other tax relief for timber growers in the hurricane disaster areas . </s>
<s> HE RODE HIS HOBBY , but he could n't milk it , the Tax Court says . </s>
<s> The court often weighs deductions of sideline-business costs : Do they stem from a profit-seeking activity or a nondeductible hobby ? </s>
<s> But it 's rare to see both functions in one case . </s>
<s> Charles O. Givens of Mount Vernon , Ind. - investment broker , ex-accountant , and son of a former stable owner - bred Tennessee Walking Horses for six years , raised cattle for four , and never made a profit on either . </s>
<s> He claimed losses totaling $ 42,455 -- and the IRS denied them all . </s>
<s> Special Judge Galloway noted that Givens managed horse-breeding in a businesslike way : He kept detailed accounts , practiced soil conservation , enhanced his experience by consulting experts , spent several hours a day doing chores , and dropped the sideline when his best brood mare died . </s>
<s> Yet he took little businesslike care with his cattle : He had no prior experience and did n't seek business counsel about them . </s>
<s> The judge said Givens may deduct his $ 30,180 of losses from horse breeding , but rejected the $ 12,275 in deductions from the cattle operation . </s>
<s> BRIEFS : </s>
<s> The IRS already is doing intensive TCMP audits of 19,000 returns for 1987 and fiscal 1988 filed by corporations with under $ 10 million in assets ... . </s>
<s> President Bush says he will name Donald E. Kirkendall to the new Treasury post of inspector general , which has responsibilities for the IRS ... . </s>
<s> The U.S. and Finland signed an income-tax treaty , subject to ratification . </s>
