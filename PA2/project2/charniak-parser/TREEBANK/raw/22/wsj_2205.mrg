<s> Steve Clark , a Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. trader , reported for work at 5 a.m. , two and a half hours before the usual Monday morning strategy meeting . </s>
<s> At Jefferies & Co. , J. Francis Palamara did n't reach the office until 5:30 a.m. , but then he had been up most of the night at home . </s>
<s> `` I had calls all night long from the States , '' he said . </s>
<s> `` I was woken up every hour -- 1:30 , 2:30 , 3:30 , 4:30 . </s>
<s> People are looking for possible opportunities to buy , but nobody wants to stick their chin out . '' </s>
<s> For many of London 's securities traders , it was a day that started nervously in the small hours . </s>
<s> By lunchtime , the selling was at near-panic fever . </s>
<s> But as the day ended in a frantic Wall Street-inspired rally , the City breathed a sigh of relief . </s>
<s> So it went yesterday in the trading rooms of London 's financial district . </s>
<s> In the wake of Wall Street 's plunge last Friday , the London market was considered especially vulnerable . </s>
<s> And before the opening of trading here yesterday , all eyes were on early trading in Tokyo for a clue as to how widespread the fallout might be . </s>
<s> By the time trading officially got under way at 9 a.m. , the news from Asia was in . </s>
<s> And it left mixed signals for London . </s>
<s> Tokyo stocks closed off a significant but less-than-alarming 1.8 % on thin volume ; Hong Kong stocks declined 6.5 % in orderly trading . </s>
<s> At Jefferies ' trading room on Finsbury Circus , a stately circle at the edge of the financial district , desktop computer screens displayed the London market 's major barometer -- the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index . </s>
<s> Red figures on the screens indicated falling stocks ; blue figures , rising stocks . </s>
<s> Right away , the reds outnumbered the blues , 80 to 20 , as the index opened at 2076.8 , off 157.1 points , or 7 % . </s>
<s> `` I see concern , but I do n't see any panic , '' said Mr. Palamara , a big , good-humored New York native who runs the 15-trader office . </s>
<s> The Jefferies office , a branch of the Los Angeles-based firm , played it conservatively , seeking to avoid risk . </s>
<s> `` This is not the sort of market to have a big position in , '' said David Smith , who heads trading in all non-U.S. stocks . </s>
<s> `` We tend to run a very tight book . '' </s>
<s> Jefferies spent most of its energies in the morning trying to match buyers and sellers , and there were n't many buyers . </s>
<s> `` All the takeover stocks -- Scottish & Newcastle , B.A.T , DRG -- are getting pretty well pasted this morning , '' Mr. Smith said . </s>
<s> Seconds later , a 7,500-share `` sell '' order for Scottish & Newcastle came in . </s>
<s> For the third time in 15 minutes , a trader next to Mr. Smith left the no-smoking area to have a cigarette . </s>
<s> On the screens , only two forlorn blue figures remained , but the index had recovered a few points and was off about 140 . </s>
<s> `` Because Tokyo did n't collapse , let 's pick up a little stock , '' Mr. Smith said . </s>
<s> He targeted 7,500 shares of Reuters and punched a button to call up on his screen other dealers ' price quotes . </s>
<s> The vivid yellow figures showed the best price at 845 pence , -LRB- $ 13.27 -RRB- and Mr. Smith 's traders started putting out feelers . </s>
<s> But the market sensed a serious buyer on a day dominated by selling , and the quotes immediately jumped to 850 pence . </s>
<s> `` When I want to buy , they run from you -- they keep changing their prices , '' Mr. Smith said . </s>
<s> `` It 's very frustrating . '' </s>
<s> He temporarily abandoned his search for the Reuters shares . </s>
<s> By this time , it was 4:30 a.m. in New York , and Mr. Smith fielded a call from a New York customer wanting an opinion on the British stock market , which had been having troubles of its own even before Friday 's New York market break . </s>
<s> `` Fundamentally dangerous ... , '' Mr. Smith said , almost in a whisper , `` ... . fundamentally weak ... fairly vulnerable still ... extremely dangerously poised ... </s>
<s> we 're in for a lot of turbulence ... . '' </s>
<s> He was right . </s>
<s> By midday , the London market was in full retreat . </s>
<s> `` It 's falling like a stone , '' said Danny Linger , a pit trader who was standing outside the London International Financial Futures Exchange . </s>
<s> Only half the usual lunchtime crowd gathered at the tony Corney & Barrow wine bar on Old Broad Street nearby . </s>
<s> Conversation was subdued as most patrons watched the latest market statistics on television . </s>
<s> At 12:49 p.m. , the index hit its low , 2029.7 , off 204.2 points . </s>
<s> `` France opened the limit down , off at least 10 % if you could calculate the index , which you could n't , '' Mr. Clark , the Shearson trader , said early in the afternoon . </s>
<s> `` Spain is down 10 % and suspended , Sweden 's down 8 % , Norway 11 % . </s>
<s> This market has been very badly damaged . '' </s>
<s> As 2:30 p.m. -- Wall Street 's opening time -- neared , Shearson traders and salesmen traded bets on how low the New York market would open . </s>
<s> In the center of the trading floor , chief trader Roger Streeter and two colleagues scrambled for the telephones as soon as the New York market opened -- plummeting more than 60 points in the first few minutes . </s>
<s> They saw an opportunity created by the sell-off . </s>
<s> As Wall Street traders dumped American Depositary Receipts in Jaguar PLC , Mr. Streeter and trader Sam Ruiz bought them to resell in the U.K . </s>
<s> Investors here still expect Ford Motor Co. or General Motors Corp. to bid for Jaguar . </s>
<s> Suddenly , after about 45 minutes , the U.S. markets rallied . </s>
<s> `` The MMI has gone better , '' shouted one trader at about 3:15 London time , as the U.S. Major Markets Index contract suddenly indicated a turnabout . </s>
<s> As Wall Street strengthened , the London trading room went wild . </s>
<s> Traders shouted as their screens posted an ever-narrowing loss on Wall Street . </s>
<s> Then , nine minutes later , Wall Street suddenly rebounded to a gain on the day . </s>
<s> `` Rally ! Rally ! Rally ! '' shouted Shearson trader Andy Rosen , selling more Jaguar shares . </s>
<s> `` This is panic buying ! '' </s>
<s> As the London market rallied , some wondered whether the weekend of worrying and jitters had been worth it . </s>
<s> The London index closed at 2163.4 , its high for the day , off 70.5 , or about 3.3 % . </s>
