<s> The House Aviation Subcommittee approved a bill that would give the transportation secretary authority to review and approve leveraged buy-outs of major U.S. airlines . </s>
<s> The collapsed plan to acquire UAL Corp. , parent of United Airlines , spurred quick action on the legislation , introduced Wednesday and approved by the subcommittee on a voice vote yesterday . </s>
<s> The bill is expected to be taken up by the Public Works and Transportation Committee tomorrow , and a floor vote by next week will be urged . </s>
<s> The measure drew criticism from the Bush administration and a parting shot from financier Donald Trump , who yesterday withdrew his takeover bid for AMR Corp. , the parent of American Airlines . </s>
<s> In a letter to subcommittee Chairman James Oberstar -LRB- D. , Minn. -RRB- , Mr. Trump criticized the bill as an explicit effort to thwart his bid for AMR , and said it contributed to the collapse of the deal . </s>
<s> Elaine Chao , deputy transportation secretary , also sent a letter to express the administration 's opposition to the bill `` in its present form . '' </s>
<s> Rep. Oberstar brushed off Mr. Trump 's allegations as an `` excuse for his own deal failing . '' </s>
<s> He also said the fact that the other letter had n't come from Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner indicated there is `` wiggle room '' in the administration 's position . </s>
<s> Mr. Oberstar and other committee members repeatedly stressed that the legislation was n't a response to any particular market situation . </s>
<s> But they cited the UAL and AMR examples as reasons to move quickly to enact this legislation . </s>
<s> Aides both in the House and Senate said the withdrawal of the Trump bid for AMR is n't likely to deflate efforts to push the legislation . </s>
<s> `` It 's still on the fast track and we still want to do it , '' said one Senate aide . </s>
<s> The bill is aimed at addressing the concern that an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures to pay off the debt incurred in a leveraged buy-out . </s>
<s> Currently , the transportation secretary does n't have clearly established authority to block mergers , but can take the drastic step of revoking the operating certificate of any carrier the official considers unfit . </s>
<s> Supporters of the legislation view the bill as an effort to add stability and certainty to the airline-acquisition process , and to preserve the safety and fitness of the industry . </s>
<s> In general , the bill would give the Transportation Department a 30-day review period before 15 % or more of the voting stock of a major U.S. air carrier could be acquired . </s>
<s> It also would require the acquiring party to notify the transportation secretary and to provide all information relevant to determining the intent of the acquisition . </s>
<s> The bill would allow the secretary to reject a buy-out if sufficient information has n't been provided , or if the buy-out is likely to weaken the carrier financially , result in a substantial reduction in size of the airline through disposal of assets , or give control to a foreign interest . </s>
<s> If more information is needed , the secretary would have authority to extend the review period 20 days . </s>
<s> All the witnesses , both congressmen and industry experts , expressed support for the bill in order to prevent profiteers from cashing in on airline profits at the expense of safe , cost-effective service . </s>
<s> But several committee members disapproved , some backing Mr. Trump 's claim that the threat of regulation caused the failure of the UAL deal and the stock-market plunge . </s>
<s> One of the major concerns expressed by the dissenters was that large airlines would be prohibited from divesting themselves of smaller entities and producing independent spin-off companies . </s>
