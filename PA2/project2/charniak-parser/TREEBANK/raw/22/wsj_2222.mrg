<s> What happened Friday shows that financial markets are not yet sufficiently coordinated to handle another meltdown in prices . </s>
<s> No fiddling with systems and procedures will ever prevent markets from suffering a panic wave of selling . </s>
<s> But markets can operate with greater or lesser efficiency . </s>
<s> After the 1987 plunge , markets agreed that it would be wise to halt trading whenever panic conditions arose . </s>
<s> The New York Stock Exchange adopted two specific circuit breakers : If the Dow Jones index falls 250 points in a day , the exchange will halt trading for one hour ; if the decline hits 400 points , the exchange will close for an additional two hours . </s>
<s> The rationale is that an interruption of trading will allow investors to reconsider their strategies , calm sellers and lead buyers to enter the market at indicated new price levels . </s>
<s> It is impossible to know whether that theory is realistic . </s>
<s> A temporary cessation of trading may indeed discourage a selling panic from feeding on itself . </s>
<s> But there is also the possibility that shutting down markets will intensify fears and cause an even more abrupt slide in prices . </s>
<s> What happened Friday was the worst of all worlds . </s>
<s> The futures exchanges followed their own pre-set circuit breakers and shut down at about 3 p.m. for 30 minutes , after the Standard & Poor 's 500 stock index had fallen 12 points , or about 100 points on the Dow Jones index . </s>
<s> Options markets stopped trading in many securities . </s>
<s> The New York Stock Exchange , under its own rules , remained open . </s>
<s> With nowhere else to go , sellers , and particularly program traders , focused all their selling on the New York Stock Exchange . </s>
<s> As liquidity on that market weakened , prices fell sharply . </s>
<s> Had the futures and options markets been open , additional liquidity would have been provided and the decline , most probably , would have been less intense . </s>
<s> At 3:30 , after intense telephone negotiations between the trading markets and Washington , the futures exchanges reopened . </s>
<s> Futures trading , however , was halted altogether at 3:45 , after the futures markets had dropped an additional 30 points , which is the daily limit for price declines . </s>
<s> At this point , the options markets also shut down and once more left all sales to be handled by the New York Stock Exchange . </s>
<s> It is time to recognize that the New York Stock Exchange , the futures markets and the options markets , though physically separate , have actually become so closely intertwined as to constitute one market effectively . </s>
<s> Traders can vary their strategies and execute their orders in any one of them . </s>
<s> It therefore makes no sense for each market to adopt different circuit breakers . </s>
<s> To achieve maximum liquidity and minimize price volatility , either all markets should be open to trading or none . </s>
<s> Synchronized circuit breakers would not have halted the slide in prices on Friday , but they probably would have made for smoother , less volatile executions . </s>
<s> It 's time for the exchanges and the Securities and Exchange Commission to agree on joint conditions for halting trading or staying open . </s>
<s> Let 's not have one market shut down for 30 minutes when the Dow declines 100 points and another shut down for an hour after a 250-point decline . </s>
<s> The need for hurried last-minute telephone negotiations among market officials will disappear once rules are in place that synchronize circuit breakers in all markets . </s>
<s> The new circuit breakers , if they are to be applied at all , will require that futures and options trading continue as long as the New York Stock Exchange remains open . </s>
<s> The rules should be established by agreement of the officials of all affected exchanges acting under the oversight and with the approval of the government regulatory agencies . </s>
<s> Should the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission -LRB- which , with the SEC , regulates the Chicago stock-index markets -RRB- be unable to agree , the issue may have to be resolved by decision of the Treasury secretary . </s>
<s> In many ways , our financial markets are better prepared today to handle a decline than they were two years ago . </s>
<s> The New York Stock Exchange now has the capacity to handle a volume of nearly a billion shares a day . </s>
<s> Telephone service has been improved for customers trying to reach their brokers , and specialists -- who I believe should stay , despite the urgings of some post-crash critics -- have larger capital positions . </s>
<s> -LRB- Of course , specialists ' actions alone can never prevent a major crack in stock prices . </s>
<s> Witness the fact that trading in some stocks closed early Friday and opened late Monday because of an excess of sell orders . -RRB- </s>
<s> But the task of improving market performance remains unfinished . </s>
