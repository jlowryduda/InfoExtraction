<s> For the moment , at least , euphoria has replaced anxiety on Wall Street . </s>
<s> The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped sharply yesterday to close at 2657.38 , panic did n't sweep the world 's markets , and investors large and small seemed to accept Friday 's dizzying 190-point plunge as a sharp correction , not a calamity . </s>
<s> Many went bargain-hunting . </s>
<s> Among those sighing with relief was John H. Gutfreund , chairman of Salomon Brothers , who took to the firm 's trading floor to monitor yesterday 's events . </s>
<s> As the rally gained strength at 3:15 p.m. , he smiled broadly , brandished his unlit cigar and slapped Stanley Shopkorn , his top stock trader , on the back . </s>
<s> At first , it seemed as if history might repeat itself . </s>
<s> As trading opened yesterday morning on the Big Board , stocks of many of the nation 's biggest companies could n't open for trading because a wave of sell orders was overwhelming buyers . </s>
<s> By 10:10 , the Dow Industrials were off 63.52 points , and the stock of UAL Corp. , whose troubles had kicked off Friday 's plunge , still had n't opened . </s>
<s> But then , as quickly as the Dow had fallen , it began to turn around . </s>
<s> It ended with a gain of 88.12 points . </s>
<s> By the market 's close , volume on the New York exchange totaled more than 416 million , the fourth highest on record . </s>
<s> The Big Board handled the huge volume without any obvious strain , in sharp contrast to Black Monday of 1987 . </s>
<s> But the rally was largely confined to the blue-chip stocks , which had been hard hit during Friday 's selling frenzy . </s>
<s> Overall , more Big Board stocks lost money than gained . </s>
<s> And many arbitragers , already reeling from Friday 's collapse of the UAL deal , were further hurt yesterday when a proposed takeover of AMR Corp. , the parent of American Airlines , collapsed . </s>
<s> Indeed , the Dow Jones Transportation Average plunged 102.06 points , its second-worst drop in history . </s>
<s> World-wide , trading was generally manageable . </s>
<s> The Frankfurt stock exchange was hardest hit of the major markets , with blue chips there falling 12.8 % . </s>
<s> In London , a midday rally left the market 's major index off 3.2 % , and Tokyo 's leading stock index fell only 1.8 % in surprisingly lackluster trading . </s>
<s> Other , more thinly traded Asian markets were hit harder than Tokyo 's , but there were no free-fall declines . </s>
<s> Investors big and small say they learned valuable lessons since the 1987 crash : In this age of computerized trading , huge corrections or runups in a few hours ' time must be expected . </s>
<s> What 's more , such short-term cataclysms are survivable and are no cause for panic selling . </s>
<s> Stephen Boesel , a major money manager for T. Rowe Price in Baltimore , says , `` There was less panic than in 1987 : We had been through it once . '' </s>
<s> In Somerset , Wis. , Adrian Sween , who owns a supplier of nursing-home equipment and is n't active in the stock market , agrees . </s>
<s> `` I look at it as a ho-hum matter , '' he says . </s>
<s> Many other factors played a part in yesterday 's comeback . </s>
<s> The Federal Reserve signaled its willingness to provide liquidity ; the interest rate on its loans to major banks inched downward early in the day . </s>
<s> Foreign stock markets , which kicked off Black Monday with a huge selling spree , began the day off by relatively modest amounts . </s>
<s> The dollar , after falling sharply in overnight trading to 139.10 yen , bounced back strongly to 141.8 , thus easing fears that foreigners would unload U.S. stocks . </s>
<s> And the widely disseminated opinion among most market experts that a crash was n't in store also helped calm investors . </s>
<s> Many major institutions , for example , came into work yesterday ready to buy some of the blue chips they felt had been sharply undervalued on Friday . </s>
<s> Still , amid all the backslapping and signs of relief over yesterday 's events , some market professionals cautioned that there is nothing present in the current market system to prevent another dizzying drop such as Friday 's . </s>
<s> `` There is too much complacency , '' says money manager Barry Schrager . </s>
<s> Computers have increasingly connected securities markets world-wide , so that a buying or selling wave in one market is often passed around the globe . </s>
<s> So investors everywhere nervously eyed yesterday 's opening in Tokyo , where the Nikkei average of 225 blue-chip stocks got off to a rocky start . </s>
<s> The average plunged some 600 points , or 1.7 % , in the first 20 minutes of trading . </s>
<s> But the selling wave had no conviction , and the market first surged upward by 200 points , then drifted lower , closing down 647 . </s>
<s> Unlike two years ago , most of Japan 's major investors chose to sit this calamity out . </s>
<s> In Merrill Lynch & Co. 's Tokyo trading room , some 40 traders and assistants sat quietly , with few orders to process . </s>
<s> Clients `` are all staying out '' of the market , one Merrill trader says . </s>
<s> The relative calm in Tokyo proved little comfort to markets opening up in Europe . </s>
<s> Frankfurt 's opening was delayed a half hour because of a crush of sell orders . </s>
<s> `` The beginning was chaotic , '' says Nigel Longley , a broker for Commerzbank </s>
<s> In London , the view from the trading floor of an American securities firm , Jefferies & Co. , also was troubling . </s>
<s> A computer screen displaying 100 blue-chip stocks colors each one red when its price is falling . </s>
<s> The screen was a sea of red . </s>
<s> `` I see concern , but I do n't see panic , '' says J. Francis Palamara , a New Yorker who runs the 15-trader office . </s>
<s> London 's blue-chip stock index turned up just before 8 a.m . New York time , sending an encouraging message to Wall Street . </s>
<s> When trading opened in New York at 9:30 a.m. EDT , stocks fell sharply -- as expected . </s>
<s> Futures markets in Chicago had opened at a level suggesting the Dow would fall by about 60 points . </s>
<s> With sell orders piled up from Friday , about half the stocks in the Dow could n't open on time . </s>
<s> By 9:45 , the industrial average had dropped 27 points . </s>
<s> By 10 a.m. , it was down 49 . </s>
<s> Ten minutes later , the Dow hit bottom - down 63.52 points , another 2.5 % . </s>
<s> But shortly before then , some of Wall Street 's sharpest traders say , they sensed a turn . </s>
<s> `` The first thing that caught my eye that was encouraging was Treasury bonds were off , '' says Austin George , head of stock trading at T. Rowe Price . </s>
<s> `` It meant that people were n't running pell-mell to the safety of bonds . '' </s>
<s> Shortly after 10 a.m. , the Major Market Index , a Chicago Board of Trade futures contract of 20 stocks designed to mimic the DJIA , exploded upward . </s>
<s> Stock traders were buoyed -- because an upturn in the MMI had also started the recovery in stocks on the Tuesday following Black Monday . </s>
<s> `` The MMI has gone better , '' shouted a trader in the London office of Shearson Lehman Hutton . </s>
<s> Shearson 's London trading room went wild . </s>
<s> Traders shouted out as their Reuters , Quotron and Telerate screens posted an ever-narrowing loss on Wall Street . </s>
<s> Then , nine minutes later , Wall Street suddenly rebounded to a gain on the day . </s>
<s> `` Rally , rally , rally , '' shouted Shearson 's Andy Rosen . </s>
<s> `` This is panic buying . '' </s>
<s> Major blue-chip stocks like Philip Morris , General Motors and Proctor & Gamble led the rally . </s>
<s> Japanese were said to be heavy buyers . </s>
<s> German and Dutch investors reportedly loaded up on Kellogg Co . </s>
<s> Then , traders say , corporations with share buy-back programs kicked into high gear , triggering gains in , among other issues , Alcan Aluminium and McDonald 's . </s>
<s> Walt Disney Co. , which had one of the biggest sell-order imbalances on Friday and was one of seven stocks that halted trading and never reopened that day , opened yesterday late at 114.5 , down 8.5 . </s>
<s> But then it suddenly burst upward 7.5 as Goldman , Sachs & Co. stepped in and bought almost every share offer , traders said . </s>
<s> By 10:25 , the Dow had turned up for the day , prompting cheers on trading desks and exchange floors . </s>
<s> Among Big Board specialists , the cry was `` Pull your offers '' -- meaning that specialists soon expected to get higher prices for their shares . </s>
<s> `` It was bedlam on the upside , '' said one Big Board specialist . </s>
<s> `` What we had was a real , old-fashioned rally . '' </s>
<s> This technical strength spurred buying from Wall Street 's `` black boxes , '' computer programs designed to trigger large stock purchases during bullish periods . </s>
<s> Typical , perhaps , was Batterymarch 's Dean LeBaron . </s>
<s> Mr. LeBaron , who manages $ 10 billion , says , `` We turned the trading system on , and it did whatever it was programmed to do . '' </s>
<s> Asked what stocks the computer bought , the money manager says , `` I do n't know . '' </s>
<s> Not everybody was making money . </s>
<s> The carnage on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , the nation 's major options market , was heavy after the trading in S&P 100 stock-index options was halted Friday . </s>
<s> Many market makers in the S&P 100 index options contract had bullish positions Friday , and when the shutdown came they were frozen with huge losses . </s>
<s> Over the weekend , clearing firms told the Chicago market makers to get out of their positions at any cost Monday morning . </s>
<s> `` They were absolutely killed , slaughtered , '' said one Chicago-based options trader . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , a test of the stock market 's rally came at about 2 p.m. , with the Dow at 2600 , up 31 points on the day . </s>
<s> Charles Clough , a strategist at Merrill Lynch , says bargain hunting had explained the Dow 's strength up to that point and that many market professionals were anticipating a drop in the Dow . </s>
<s> Moreover , the announcement that real estate magnate and sometime raider Donald Trump was withdrawing his offer for AMR Corp. might have been expected to rattle traders . </s>
<s> Instead , the rally only paused for about 25 minutes and then steamed forward as institutions resumed buying . </s>
<s> The market closed minutes after reaching its high for the day of </s>
<s> Across the country , many people took yesterday 's events in stride , while remaining generally uneasy about the stock market in general . </s>
<s> Says James Norman , the mayor of Ava , Mo. : `` I do n't invest in stocks . </s>
<s> I much prefer money I can put my hands on . '' </s>
<s> While Mayor Norman found the market 's performance Monday reassuring , he says , he remains uneasy . </s>
<s> `` We have half the experts saying one thing and half the other '' about the course of the economy . </s>
<s> Ralph Holzfaster , a farmer and farm-supply store operator in Ogallala , Neb. , says of the last few days events , `` If anything good comes out of this , it might be that it puts some of these LBOs on the skids . '' </s>
<s> Says Gordon Fines , a money manager at IDS Financial Services in Minneapolis , `` You 're on a roller coaster , and that may last . </s>
<s> The public is still cautious . </s>
