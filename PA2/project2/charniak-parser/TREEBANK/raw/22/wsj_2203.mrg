<s> NCR Corp. reported a 10 % drop in third-quarter net income , citing intense competition that caused its gross profit margins to dip . </s>
<s> Net income for the quarter fell to $ 93.1 million from $ 103.1 million , roughly what analysts had expected . </s>

<s> NCR said revenue declined both in the U.S. and overseas , reflecting a world-wide softening of the computer markets . </s>
<s> The company , however , said orders in the U.S. showed `` good gains '' during the latest quarter . </s>
<s> Analysts estimate those gains at 12 % to 13 % , a good part of it coming from large orders placed by a few of NCR 's major customers . </s>
