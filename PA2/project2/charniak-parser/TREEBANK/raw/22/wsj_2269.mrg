<s> Whirlpool Corp. , Benton Harbor , Mich. , said it has developed a process to recover environmentally harmful chlorofluorocarbons , or CFCs , that previously entered the atmosphere during in-home repair of refrigerators and freezers . </s>
<s> The maker of home appliances said the process , which involves the use of a multilayer plastic bag during repairs to capture the gaseous substance and transport it to a recycling center , is already in use at a number of its service centers , and will be available to all authorized repair centers by spring . </s>
<s> Earlier repairs vented the CFCs out of the home through a hose directly into the atmosphere . </s>
<s> CFCs are widely used as solvents , coolants and fire suppressants . </s>
<s> But their use has been linked to a potentially dangerous depletion of the Earth 's ozone layer , and a number of companies are seeking to curtail use , or at least emission , of the substance . </s>
<s> Whirpool said , `` We see this process as a small but important step toward eventual elimination of CFC use in appliance manufacture . </s>
