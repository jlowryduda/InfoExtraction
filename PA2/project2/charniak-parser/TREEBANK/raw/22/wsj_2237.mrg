<s> Congress has been critical of the Bush administration for not sending enough aid to Poland , so it is getting ready to send its own version of a CARE package . </s>
<s> Last month , the Senate voted to send a delegation of congressional staffers to Poland to assist its legislature , the Sejm , in democratic procedures . </s>
<s> Senator Pete Domenici calls this effort `` the first gift of democracy . '' </s>
<s> The Poles might do better to view it as a Trojan Horse . </s>
<s> It is the vast shadow government of 15,000 congressional staffers that helps create such legislative atrocities as the 1,376 page , 13-pound reconciliation bill that claimed to be the budget of the United States . </s>
<s> Maybe after the staffers explain their work to the Poles , they 'd be willing to come back and do the same for the American people . </s>
