<s> Concerning your Sept. 19 article `` Wall Street Firms Link Analysts ' Pay to Performance , '' I 'm delighted that Wall Street is finally tuning in to the hard , cold facts of the real working world . </s>
<s> If the firms are serious , however , why limit the practice to the poor , maligned analysts whose ability to see into the future is fragile at best ? </s>
<s> Why not extend the same harsh standards to the sales force , and pay brokers a base salary with annual bonus based on how much money they made for their clients during the year ? </s>
<s> That should stop a lot of account-churning , and produce a stock market driven only by professional concern , careful thought and good sense . </s>
<s> Now , would n't that be a novelty . </s>
