<s> J.P. Morgan & Co. swung to a loss in the third quarter , while NCNB Corp. reported net income more than doubled , and Security Pacific Corp. net rose 10 % . </s>
<s> J.P. Morgan & Co . </s>
<s> J.P. Morgan , as expected , posted a $ 1.82 billion net loss for the quarter , reflecting the New York bank 's decision last month to add $ 2 billion to reserves for losses on loans to less-developed countries . </s>
<s> The reserve addition placed the parent of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. among a few major U.S. banks that have covered nearly all their medium and long-term portfolios to less-developed countries with reserves . </s>
<s> The latest quarter 's loss equals $ 9.92 a share . </s>
<s> In the year-earlier quarter , Morgan earned $ 233.6 million , or $ 1.25 a share . </s>
<s> George M. Salem , analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. , called the results `` mildly disappointing . '' </s>
<s> Excluding the $ 2 billion provision and allowing for the taxes Morgan paid , earnings were about 65 cents a share , Mr. Salem said . </s>
<s> In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Morgan climbed $ 1.50 a share to $ 44.125 . </s>
<s> Net interest income sank 27 % in the quarter to $ 254 million from $ 347 million . </s>
<s> The interest rate on short-term funds , which banks borrow to finance longer-term loans to customers , was `` sharply higher , '' Morgan said . </s>
<s> Morgan received $ 2 million of interest payments on its medium and long-term Brazilian loans ; had they been accruing interest , net interest income would have been $ 35 million higher in the quarter , Morgan said . </s>
<s> Such loans to Argentina also remain classified as non-accruing , costing the bank $ 10 million of interest income in the third period . </s>
<s> Income from sources other than interest climbed 12 % to $ 414 million , reflecting higher corporate-finance and other fees and gains on sales of investment securities . </s>
<s> `` These increases were partly offset by lower trading-related '' income , the bank said . </s>
<s> Non-interest expenses grew 16 % to $ 496 million . </s>
<s> NCNB Corp . </s>
<s> NCNB Corp. 's net income more than doubled in the period , largely because of continued strong performance by the bank 's Texas operations . </s>
<s> The Charlotte , N.C. , company said earnings rose to $ 143.6 million , or $ 1.45 a share , from $ 58.9 million , or 69 cents a share , a year earlier . </s>
<s> The latest quarter included a gain of $ 56.1 million , or 59 cents a share , related to the purchase of the remaining 51 % of NCNB Texas National Bank from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . </s>
<s> The strong performance , however , contrasted with an unexpectedly large increase in the size of NCNB 's problem loans , particularly in the Southeast . </s>
<s> In the third quarter , nonperforming assets jumped to $ 474.1 million , or 1.43 % of net loans and leases , from $ 232.8 million , or 1.13 % in the second quarter . </s>
<s> Nonperformers totaled $ 230.8 million , or 1.27 % in the year-ago third quarter . </s>
<s> Included in the increase in the most recent quarter is a $ 33 million loan , which NCNB said it `` expects to be fully repaid , with no loss , early in the fourth quarter . '' </s>
<s> The deterioration in credit quality offset strong loan growth of 17 % in NCNB 's Southeast operations , as well as a 28 % growth in deposits resulting from an aggressive marketing campaign . </s>
<s> The higher rates paid on deposits also helped squeeze NCNB 's net interest margin in the Southeast to 3.38 % from 3.80 % a year earlier . </s>
<s> In Big Board composite trading yesterday , NCNB jumped $ 3.50 a share , to $ 51 . </s>
<s> Results were released after the market closed . </s>
<s> NCNB Texas National , formed from the remnants of of the failed First RepublicBank Corp. of Dallas , contributed $ 76.9 million to NCNB 's bottom line in the third quarter . </s>
<s> NCNB said its third-quarter results reflect 100 % of earnings of the Texas operation since Aug. 1 . </s>
<s> NCNB raised some $ 1.9 billion in new capital during the quarter to complete the NCNB Texas purchase , and to acquire several small failed thrifts to fill out its regional franchise . </s>
<s> Last week , the banking company said it purchased both Freedom Savings & Loan Association , Tampa , Fla. , and University Federal Savings Association of San Antonio , Texas , for $ 169.4 million . </s>
<s> In the first nine months , NCNB 's net income climbed 65 % to $ 310.9 million , or $ 3.30 a share , from $ 188.2 million , or $ 2.22 a share , a year earlier . </s>
<s> Security Pacific Corp . </s>
<s> Security Pacific 's earnings growth slowed in the third quarter , but the Los Angeles bank holding company was still able to post a 10 % increase in net income because of robust growth in residential real-estate and consumer loans . </s>
<s> Net rose to $ 185.1 million , or $ 1.55 a share , from $ 167.9 million , or $ 1.47 a share , a year earlier . </s>
<s> The company said the gain resulted mainly from a $ 54 million increase in net interest income , reflecting a 33 % increase in real estate loans -LRB- mainly residential -RRB- , and a 19 % rise in consumer loans . </s>
<s> These high-yielding loans in effect replaced some low-yielding assets such as inter-bank loans , which were allowed to decrease . </s>
<s> As a result , Security Pacific 's net interest margin fell only 13 basis points , a more mild decrease than some major banks outside California , which have been reporting more sluggish earnings . </s>
<s> Security Pacific shares closed at $ 44.625 , down 37.5 cents , in Big Board composite trading . </s>
<s> The earnings represent a 0.89 % return on assets for Security Pacific , and an 18.9 % return on equity . </s>
<s> The loan growth offset continuing real-estate loan losses in the depressed Arizona market . </s>
<s> Security Pacific reported a 33 % increase in net credit losses for the quarter , to $ 109 million from $ 81.9 million in the year-ago period . </s>
<s> Nonperforming loans grew slightly to $ 1.75 billion at Sept. 30 , from $ 1.7 billion a year ago . </s>
<s> Security Pacific 's loan-loss provision was down 22 % , or $ 30.4 million , because it added to its foreign-debt reserve the year before . </s>
<s> Non-interest income fell 6 % in the quarter , mainly because of an unusual gain a year earlier from the sale of Hong Kong banking operations . </s>
<s> Non-interest expense grew only 4 % in the period . </s>
<s> For the nine months , net rose 17 % to $ 548.9 million , or $ 4.67 a share , from $ 469.4 million , or $ 4.13 a share , a year earlier . </s>
