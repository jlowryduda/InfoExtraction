<s> You know what the law of averages is , do n't you ? </s>
<s> It 's what 1 -RRB- explains why we are like , well , ourselves rather than Bo Jackson ; 2 -RRB- cautions that it 's possible to drown in a lake that averages two feet deep ; and 3 -RRB- predicts that 10,000 monkeys placed before 10,000 pianos would produce 1,118 publishable rock 'n' roll tunes . </s>
<s> Baseball , that game of the long haul , is the quintessential sport of the mean , and the mean ol' law caught up with the San Francisco Giants in the World Series last weekend . </s>
<s> The team that dumped runs by the bushel on the Chicago Cubs in the National League playoffs was held to just one in two games by the home-team Oakland A 's , the gang that had been done unto similarly by the Los Angeles Dodgers and Orel Hershiser in last year 's tournament . </s>
<s> Morever , much of the damage was accomplished by A 's who had some catching up to do . </s>
<s> In game two , on a cool Sunday evening in this land of perpetual autumn , a lot of the catching up was done by the A 's catcher , Terry Steinbach . </s>
<s> He hit a 2-0 pitch from Rick Reuschel into the left-field stands in inning four to stretch his team 's lead from 2-1 to a decisive 5-1 , where it stayed . </s>
<s> So what if Steinbach had struck just seven home runs in 130 regular-season games , and batted in the seventh position of the A 's lineup . </s>
<s> `` If you get your pitch , and take a good swing , anything can happen , '' he later remarked . </s>
<s> On Saturday night , quite a few of the boys in green and gold salted away successes to salve the pain of past and , no doubt , future droughts . </s>
<s> Mark McGwire , the big , red-haired Oakland first baseman , had three hits in four at bats , two more than he 'd had in the five-game Dodger series in which he 'd gone 1-for-17 . </s>
<s> The A-men batting Nos. 6 through 9 , a.k.a. the `` bottom of the order , '' got seven of their team 's 11 hits and scored four of its runs in a 5-0 decision . </s>
<s> Right-hander Dave Stewart held the Giants to five hits to account for the zero on the other side of the Saturday ledger . </s>
<s> That he was the A 's winningest pitcher during its American League campaign with a 21-9 mark , plus two wins over Toronto in the playoffs , indicates he may have some evening up coming , but with the way his split-fingered fastball is behaving , that might not be this week . </s>
<s> The same goes for Mike Moore , another veteran who overcame early struggles to permit the Giants but a run and four hits in seven innings in Sunday 's contest . </s>
<s> `` Every guy they put out there had a better split-finger than the guy before , '' marveled Giant manager Roger Craig . </s>
<s> He 's an ex-hurler who 's one of the leading gurus of the fashionable delivery , which looks like a fastball until it dives beneath the lunging bat . </s>
<s> The upshot of the downshoot is that the A 's go into San Francisco 's Candlestick Park tonight up two games to none in the best-of-seven fest . </s>
<s> The stat to reckon with here says that about three of four clubs -LRB- 29 of 39 -RRB- that took 2-0 Series leads went on to win it all . </s>
<s> That 's not an average to soothe Giant rooters . </s>
<s> One might think that the home fans in this Series of the Subway Called BART -LRB- that 's a better name for a public conveyance than `` Desire , '' do n't you think ? -RRB- would have been ecstatic over the proceedings , but they observe them in relative calm . </s>
<s> Partisans of the two combatants sat side by side in the 49,000-plus seats of Oakland Coliseum , and while they cheered their favorites and booed the opposition , hostilities advanced no further , at least as far as I could see . </s>
<s> A few folks even showed up wearing caps bearing the colors and emblems of both teams . </s>
<s> `` I 'm for the Giants today , but only because they lost yesterday . </s>
<s> I love 'em both . </s>
<s> The only thing I 'm rooting for is for the Series to go seven games , '' said David Williams , a Sacramento septuagenarian , at the Coliseum before Sunday 's go . </s>
<s> The above represents a triumph of either apathy or civility . </s>
<s> I choose to believe it 's the latter , although it probably springs from the fact that just about everyone out here , including the A 's and Giants , is originally from somewhere else . </s>
<s> Suffice it to say that if this were a New York Yankees-Mets series , or one between the Chicago Cubs and White Sox -LRB- hey , it 's possible -RRB- , you 'd need uniformed police in every other seat to separate opposing fans , and only the suicidal would bifurcate their bonnets . </s>
<s> Anyway , the A 's gave you a lot of heroes to root for . </s>
<s> In the opening game , besides Steinbach and Stewart , there was Walt Weiss , a twiggy-looking , second-year shortstop who had lost a couple months of the season to knee surgery . </s>
<s> He was flawless afield -LRB- ditto in game two -RRB- , moved a runner along in the A 's three-run second inning , and homered for his team 's final tally . </s>
<s> Such is his reputation among the East Bay Bashers that when he hit his first career home run last season , the fan who caught it agreed to turn the ball over to him in return for an autograph . </s>
<s> Not his autograph ; power-hitter McGwire 's . </s>
<s> An A 's co-hero of the second game was Rickey Henderson , who exemplifies the hot side of the hot-cold equation . </s>
<s> He smoked Toronto in the playoffs with six hits , seven walks and eight stolen bases in 22 at bats , and continued that by going 3-for-3 at the plate Sunday , along with walking , stealing a base and scoring a run . </s>
<s> `` When you 're in the groove , you see every ball tremendously , '' he lectured . </s>
<s> The cold guys in the set were Will Clark , Kevin Mitchell and Matt Williams , the Giants ' 3-4-5 hitters . </s>
<s> They combined for 25 hits , six home runs and 24 runs batted in in the five games against the Cubs . </s>
<s> They went a collective 5-for-24 here , with zero homers and ribbies . </s>
<s> It 's that last set of numbers , as much as anything else , that gives the Giants hope in the Series games to come . </s>
<s> `` I believe in the law of averages , '' declared San Francisco batting coach Dusty Baker after game two . </s>
<s> `` I 'd rather see a so-so hitter who 's hot come up for the other side than a good hitter who 's cold . '' </s>
<s> But the old Dodger slugger wisely offered no prediction about when good times would return to his side . </s>
<s> `` When it goes , you never know when you 'll get it back , '' he said . </s>
<s> `` That 's baseball . </s>
