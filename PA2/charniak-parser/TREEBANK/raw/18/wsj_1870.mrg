<s> From a helicopter a thousand feet above Oakland after the second-deadliest earthquake in U.S. history , a scene of devastation emerges : a freeway crumbled into a concrete sandwich , hoses pumping water into once-fashionable apartments , abandoned autos . </s>
<s> But this quake was n't the big one , the replay of 1906 that has been feared for so many years . </s>
<s> Despite the tragic loss of more than 270 lives , and damage estimated in the billions , most businesses and their plants and offices in the Bay area were n't greatly affected . </s>
<s> The economic life of the region is expected to revive in a day or two , although some transportation problems may last weeks or months . </s>
<s> A main factor mitigating more widespread damage was the location of the quake 's epicenter -- 20 miles from the heart of the Silicon Valley and more than 50 miles from downtown San Francisco and Oakland . </s>
<s> Also , the region 's insistence on strict building codes helped prevent wider damage . </s>
<s> The tremendous energy of the quake was dissipated by the distance , so that most parts of the valley and the major cities suffered largely cosmetic damage -- broken windows , falling brick and cornices , buckled asphalt or sidewalks . </s>
<s> Of course , the quake was the worst since the emergence of the computer era turned Silicon Valley into the nation 's capital of high technology . </s>
<s> Like other major American cities , the San Francisco -- Oakland area owes its current prosperity more to its infrastructure of fiber-optic cables linking thousands of computer terminals and telephones than to its location astride one of the world 's great natural harbors . </s>
<s> When the tremors struck , the region 's largely unseen high-tech fabric held up surprisingly well despite the devastation visible from the air . </s>
<s> Michael L. Bandler , vice president for network technology at Pacific Bell Telephone Co. , says nearly all the network 's computer switches , which move thousands of calls a minute from one location to another , changed to battery power when the city lost power . </s>
<s> The battery packs have enough power for only three hours , but that gave emergency crews time to turn on an emergency system that runs primarily on diesel fuel . </s>
<s> Of some 160 switches in Pacific Bell 's network , only four went down . </s>
<s> One of those was in Hollister , Calif. , near the earthquake 's epicenter . </s>
<s> Few telephone lines snapped . </s>
<s> That 's because the widely used fiber-optic cable has been installed underground with 25 extra feet of cable between junction points . </s>
<s> The slack absorbs the pulling strain generated by an earthquake . </s>
<s> Nevertheless , phone service was sporadic ; many computer terminals remained dark , and by late yesterday a third of San Francisco remained without power . </s>
<s> Business in the nation 's fourth-largest metropolitan region was nearly paralyzed ; an estimated one million members of the work force stayed at home . </s>
<s> The economic dislocation was as abrupt as the earthquake itself , as virtually all businesses shut down . </s>
<s> The $ 125-billion-a-year Bay area economy represents one-fourth of the economy of the nation 's most populous state and accounts for 2 % to 3 % of the nation 's total output of goods and services , according to the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto . </s>
<s> In high-tech , the Bay area accounts for 15 % to 20 % of the U.S. computer-related industry . </s>
<s> `` This has been a major disruption for the Bay area economy , '' says Pauline Sweezey , the chief economist at the California Department of Finance . </s>
<s> `` Obviously , things are going to have to go on hold for many companies . '' </s>
<s> The damage to the Bay area 's roadways could cause significant economic hardship . </s>
<s> A quarter of a million people cross the Bay Bridge every day , far more than the 100,000 that use the Bay Area Rapid Transit system -LRB- BART -RRB- -- which was working but was n't stopping in the city 's Financial District yesterday afternoon because electricity was shut off and the area was being checked for gas leaks . </s>
<s> California state transportation officials interviewed by telephone say they nevertheless do n't expect serious problems for commerce in and out of the Bay area . </s>
<s> All major roadways except Interstate 880 , known as the Nimitz Freeway , and the Bay Bridge were open by 1 p.m. yesterday . </s>
<s> Officials expect difficulty routing traffic through downtown San Francisco . </s>
<s> The earthquake caused many streets to buckle and crack , making them impassible . </s>
<s> Other roads were obstructed by collapsed buildings and damaged water and power lines , an emergency relief spokesman says . </s>
<s> San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos estimated the damage to his city alone at $ 2 billion . </s>
<s> But many predicted that the commercial disruption would be short-lived . </s>
<s> Of the scores of companies contacted by this newspaper , few reported any damage that they did n't expect to have remedied within a day or two . </s>
<s> It is possible , of course , that some of the most seriously damaged companies could n't be reached , particularly in areas nearest the epicenter . </s>
<s> Typical , perhaps , was the situation at New United Motor Manufacturing Inc. , the General Motors Corp.-Toyota joint-venture auto plant in Fremont , about 35 miles south of Oakland . </s>
<s> Ten of the plant 's workers were injured when the quake hit about a half-hour into the afternoon shift ; seven were hospitalized . </s>
<s> Metal racks on the plant floor fell over , and water mains ruptured , a spokeswoman says . </s>
<s> The plant was evacuated and workers sent home . </s>
<s> But the plant was able to resume limited production of its Toyota Corollas and Geo Prizms by 6 a.m. yesterday , and absenteeism was only 7 % of the work force , about twice normal . </s>
<s> Computer maker Hewlett-Packard Co. , based in Palo Alto , says one of its buildings sustained severe damage when it was knocked off its foundation . </s>
<s> Other buildings had broken glass , dangling light fixtures and broken pipes , a spokesperson says , estimating the cost of reconstruction `` in the millions . '' </s>
<s> Most banks were closed but were expected to reopen today with few problems anticipated . </s>
<s> At the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco , Vice President Robert Fienberg says operations were `` steaming along as usual '' yesterday afternoon . </s>
<s> ` When the quake hit , we turned on our emergency generator and brought our computers up , '' he says . </s>
<s> The Fed serves as a middleman for banks , taking checks from one bank and sending them to another , an operation that it handled smoothly Tuesday night after the quake . </s>
<s> `` The volume we received from the banks was a lot lower than usual , '' he says . </s>
<s> A disaster-contingency plan in which the Los Angeles Fed would come to San Francisco 's aid was n't needed , he adds . </s>
<s> Most of the telephone problems in the immediate aftermath stemmed from congestion . </s>
<s> The telephone network simply could n't handle the large number of people seeking to make a call at the same time . </s>
<s> The volume resulted in dial-tone delays that were as short as 15 seconds and as long as five minutes . </s>
<s> Mr. Bandler puts traffic volume at 10 to 50 times normal . </s>
<s> American Telephone & Telegraph Co. , MCI Communications Inc. and United Telecommunications ' U S Sprint unit were blocking phone calls into the Bay area to alleviate congestion . </s>
<s> The companies block traffic much as highway on-ramps are blocked when traffic backs up . </s>
<s> William E. Downing , Pacific Bell 's vice president of customer services for the Bay area , says most long-distance companies were blocking about 50 % of all calls . </s>
<s> Pacific Telesis says its Pacific Bell unit also was blocking about 50 % of its calls locally . </s>
<s> Ironically , the long-term effect of the earthquake may be to bolster the Bay area 's economic fortunes and , indeed , the nation 's gross national product . </s>
<s> It may also lead to new safeguards in major construction projects such as double-deck highways . </s>
<s> `` It would in the near-term give a boost to the San Francisco economy because there will be an influx of people to help , '' says Beth Burnham Mace , a regional economist at DRI\/McGraw Hill , a Lexington , Mass. , forecasting firm . </s>
<s> The construction industry is sure to feel increased demand . </s>
<s> `` There will be a big influx of federal dollars and gains in state , federal and local employment , '' Ms. Mace says . </s>
<s> Adds Stacy Kotman , an economist at Georgia State University , `` There 's nothing positive about an earthquake , but it will probably generate more construction activity . '' </s>
<s> Wall Street reacted swiftly yesterday to the disaster by bidding up stocks of construction and related companies . </s>
<s> Shares of Lone Star Industries Inc. , a cement maker , rose sharply in anticipation of stepped-up demand . </s>
<s> In Greenwich , Conn. , Lone Star spokesman Michael London says , `` Obviously with an earthquake of this size , there are likely to be construction projects that would n't otherwise have been anticipated . </s>
<s> But any increase is n't likely to be any kind of a surge . </s>
<s> It 's something likely to be spread out over a long period of time . </s>
<s> There will be a lot of repair work that wo n't require the quantities of cement or concrete that new constructon would . '' </s>
<s> Lone Star 's San Francisco facilities were n't damaged in the quake . </s>
<s> The earthquake is likely to reduce GNP negligibly in the near term and then could raise it a bit as rebuilding begins . </s>
<s> The first effects are , of course , negative as work is disrupted and people lose income and cut spending . </s>
<s> Corporate profits may also dip initially . </s>
<s> Many of the lost tourism dollars wo n't be recovered ; many trips delayed never take place . </s>
<s> Subsequently , however , the ill effects are likely to be offset , at least in economic terms , as construction activity begins . </s>
<s> Because of the way the government keeps its books , the damage to the Bay Bridge , however costly , wo n't be counted as a minus . </s>
<s> The money spent on repairs will be counted as a plus . </s>
<s> `` It 's very difficult to model the long-term impact of this , '' says Andrew Goldberg , who studies the public-policy and crisis-management aspects of earthquakes at the Center for Strategic International Studies in Washington , D.C . </s>
<s> `` You certainly can say it 's going to be extremely severe . </s>
<s> We really are talking about shutting down a major American city for a number of days , maybe for a few weeks . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Goldberg says the cost of the earthquake will definitely top $ 1 billion and could reach $ 4 billion . </s>
<s> He cautions that early damage estimates are often low ; the damage totals in Hurricane Hugo increased tenfold as more information was received . </s>
<s> The earthquake damage , of course , would have been far greater if the epicenter had been in downtown San Francisco . </s>
<s> A direct hit on a major city , Mr. Goldberg figures , would cause $ 20 billion to $ 40 billion of damage . </s>
<s> Experts caution that it is far too soon for reliable estimates of the quake 's total damage , but it 's clear that insurers are likely to pay out enormous sums . </s>
<s> Jack Byrne , the chairman of Fireman 's Fund Corp. , which is based in Novato , Calif. , estimates insured losses resulting the earthquake could total $ 2 billion . </s>
<s> The impact on the insurance industry `` will be big and harsh , but less than -LCB- Hurricane -RCB- Hugo , '' says Mr. Byrne , who toured the Bay area by car yesterday afternoon to get a sense of the company 's exposure to the earthquake . </s>
<s> Mr. Byrne says Fireman 's Fund will probably pay hundreds of millions in primary claims , but , after taxes and use of its reinsurance lines , the company 's fourthquarter charge against earnings should n't top $ 50 million . </s>
<s> The company was able to assess its damage liability quickly because it has computerized maps of Northern California showing the exact locations of all the property it insures . </s>
<s> Fireman 's Fund had claims adjusters on the streets of San Francisco right after sunrise yesterday and was paying as many claims as it could right on the spot . </s>
<s> Fireman 's Fund insures 37,300 homes and autos and 35,000 businesses in the Bay area . </s>
<s> In addition to paying for earthquake and fire damage , the insurer must cover worker-compensation claims and also losses due to businesses being shut down by lack of power or phone service . </s>
<s> But many Californians may not have adequate insurance coverage to pay for damages to their property . </s>
<s> The Independent Insurance Agents of America says fewer than one of every five California homeowners has earthquake insurance . </s>
<s> A somewhat higher percentage of people living in the Bay area have bought the additional insurance protection , but the great majority are n't covered . </s>
<s> Earthquake insurance typically runs $ 200 or more a year for a small house . </s>
<s> Whatever the long-term economic effect , the scene from the helicopter above Oakland is one of tragedy . </s>
<s> Gargantuan sections of a double-decker freeway have been heaved about like plastic building blocks . </s>
<s> Atop them sit cars and trucks abandoned in a terrifying scramble to safety the day before . </s>
<s> In areas where the freeway made giant concrete sandwiches of itself lie cars that police say have been flattened into foot-thick slabs . </s>
<s> On the periphery , rescue workers seem , from the air , to move in slow motion . </s>
<s> They peck away at the 1 1\/2-mile section of rubble , searching for more of the 250 people thought to have died here . </s>
<s> About 20 other deaths were also attributed to the earthquake . </s>
<s> The heart of the earthquake , 6.9 on the Richter scale , was 50 miles to the south , near Santa Cruz , but its terrible fist struck here on the Nimitz Freeway , a major artery serving the Bay Bridge between Oakland and San Francisco . </s>
<s> Along the way , the quake toppled a mall in Santa Cruz , knocked down buildings in San Francisco 's fashionable Marina District and sent a wall of bricks crashing on motorists in the city 's Financial District . </s>
<s> Just a short span across the bay to the west , the quake also showed its mettle : A four-square-block area of the Marina District lies smoldering under a steady stream of seawater being pumped onto rubble to prevent it from blazing anew . </s>
<s> Many of the buildings , mostly condominiums and apartments , were flattened almost instantly as the underlying soil -- much of it landfill -- was literally turned to ooze by the quake 's intensive shaking , rupturing gas lines . </s>
<s> Onlookers say three persons died when one of the buildings exploded into a fireball shortly after the quake struck . </s>
<s> Efforts to fight the blaze were hampered because water mains were severed as well . </s>
<s> From the air , ribbons of yellow fire hose carry water from the bay to high-pressure nozzles trained on the site . </s>
<s> As onlookers stand behind barricades , helmeted firemen and building inspectors survey rows of nearby buildings that were twisted from their foundations and seem on the verge of collapse . </s>
<s> In the Marina District , residents spent yesterday assessing damage , cleaning up and trying to find friends and neighbors . </s>
<s> Evelyn Boccone , 85 years old , has lived in the district most of her life . </s>
<s> Her parents lost everything in the 1906 earthquake . </s>
<s> `` Now , we realize what our mothers must have gone through , '' she says . </s>
<s> `` We always heard about the earthquake , but as children we did n't always listen . </s>
