<s> After failing to find a buyer for the Sears Tower in Chicago , Sears , Roebuck & Co. is negotiating with Boston pension fund adviser Aldrich , Eastman & Waltch Inc. to refinance the property for close to $ 850 million , according to people close to the negotiations . </s>
<s> Under the proposed agreement involving the world 's tallest building , Chicago-based Sears would receive about half the money through conventional mortgage financing and the other half as a convertible mortgage . </s>
<s> At the end of the term of the convertible loan , Sears could still own half the building , and AEW could own the other half . </s>
<s> Neither side would comment . </s>
<s> The parties are currently negotiating over who would manage the building , which will be emptied of 6,000 employees from Sears ' merchandise group , which is moving elsewhere . </s>
<s> The new manager will face the daunting task of leasing 1.8 million square feet in a relatively soft Chicago real estate market . </s>
<s> Also , it has not yet been decided exactly how much of the mortgage AEW will be able to convert into equity . </s>
<s> Convertible mortgages have become an increasingly popular way to finance prestigious buildings of late . </s>
<s> In a convertible mortgage , the investor lends the building owner a certain amount in return for the option to convert its interest into equity , usually less than 50 % , at the end of the loan term . </s>
<s> During the term , the lender can either receive a percentage of cash flow , a percentage of the building 's appreciation or a fixed return . </s>
<s> The main advantage of a convertible mortgage is that it is not a sale and therefore does not trigger costly transfer taxes and reappraisal . </s>
<s> Sears said it would put the 110-story tower on the block almost a year ago as part of its anti-takeover restructuring . </s>
<s> But Japanese institutions shied away from bidding on the high-profile tower out of fear their purchase of the property would trigger anti-Japanese sentiment . </s>
<s> Last summer , Sears appeared to have a deal with Canadian developer Olympia & York Developments Ltd . </s>
<s> But that deal fell through in September after it became clear that the sale would lead to a major real estate tax reassessment , raising property taxes , and making it difficult to lease the building at competitive prices . </s>
<s> Real estate industry executives said Sears ' investment banker , Goldman , Sachs & Co. , sought financing in Japan . </s>
<s> However , Japanese authorities apparently were concerned that a refinancing also would attract too much publicity . </s>
<s> Sears then went back to AEW , the Boston pension adviser that had proposed a convertible debt deal during the first round of bids last spring . </s>
<s> AEW has $ 3.5 billion of real estate investments nationwide , according to a spokesman . </s>
