<s> One of the most remarkable features of the forced marches of the ethnic Turks out of Bulgaria over the past five months has been the lack of international attention . </s>
<s> The deportation of more than 315,000 men , women and children by the Bulgarian regime adds up to one of the largest migrations seen in the postwar years . </s>
<s> Yet some people are advancing a chilling casuistry : that what we are seeing is somehow the understandable result of the historical sins committed by the Turks in the 16th century . </s>
<s> Today 's Turks in Bulgaria , in other words , deserve what is coming to them four centuries later . </s>
<s> As if this were n't enough , the Senate Judiciary Committee is getting into the act . </s>
<s> On Tuesday it approved Senator Bob Dole 's proposed commemorative resolution designating April 24 , 1990 , as the `` National Day of Remembrance of the 75th Anniversary of the Armenian Genocide of 1915-1923 , '' suffered at the hands of the warring Ottoman Empire . </s>
<s> There can be no quibbling that the Armenians endured terrible suffering , but one has to wonder what possible good such a resolution will achieve . </s>
<s> It puts great strain on a longstanding U.S. friendship with Turkey , a country that has been one of America 's strongest allies in NATO . </s>
<s> The resolution also comes at a time when Turkey has been seeking help from the United States in resolving its Bulgarian emigration controversy and pursuing democratic reforms that may lead to membership in the European Community . </s>
<s> Turkey has been fighting its past for years , and thus far has been only partially successful . </s>
<s> Must it now accept that one of its strongest allies blames it for the genocide of another people ? </s>
<s> Such sentiment only encourages the adverse feelings toward Turkey that surfaced when Turkey asked for assistance in dealing with its Bulgarian emigration crisis . </s>
<s> Mr. Dole 's odd effort notwithstanding , most of Turkey 's political problems lie with the Europeans . </s>
<s> Part of the problem some Europeans have with Turkey seems to stem from its location -- Turkey is n't really part of Europe . </s>
<s> Why , they wonder , should it belong to the EC ? </s>
<s> Another anti-Turkish hook is the Islamic faith of the majority of the Turkish people : Turkey , we are told , is not a Christian nation ; its people simply wo n't fit in with the Western European Judeo-Christian tradition . </s>
<s> It 's when these rationalizations fall on deaf ears that the old standby of retribution for treatment at the hands of the Ottoman Empire comes to the fore . </s>
<s> No one has to accept the sins of the Ottoman Empire to reject that argument . </s>
<s> Turkey in any event is long past it . </s>
<s> The country has in recent years accepted more than 500,000 refugees from at least four bordering nations . </s>
<s> Kurds , suffering what many people consider to be a current extermination campaign at the hands of Syria , Iran and Iraq have inundated eastern Turkey . </s>
<s> Now it is their fellow Turks arriving as refugees from Bulgaria . </s>
<s> The Turkish refugee tragedy and the ongoing crisis can not be ignored and shuttled off to that notorious dustbin of history that has become so convenient recently . </s>
<s> Surely , the past suffering of any people at any time can not be simply filed away and forgotten . </s>
<s> But what the Senate Judiciary Committee has done in supporting the strongly worded Armenian resolution achieves no useful end ; it merely produces more controversy and embittered memories . </s>
<s> Congress has enough difficulty dealing with the realities of the world as it currently exists . </s>
<s> Bulgaria 's government has been behaving beyond the pale for months , and the U.S. does its values no credit by ignoring that while casting its votes into the past . </s>
