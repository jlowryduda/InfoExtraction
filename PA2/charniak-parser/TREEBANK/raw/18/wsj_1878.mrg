<s> As the citizens of San Francisco and surrounding communities began assessing the damage from Tuesday 's devastating earthquake , NBC News began assessing the damage from what some said was a failure to provide comprehensive coverage in the earthquake 's initial moments . </s>
<s> `` In terms of coverage , it was a disaster equal to the earthquakes , '' said Eric Premner , president for broadcasting of King Broadcasting Co. , which owns the NBC affiliate in Seattle , Wash . </s>
<s> While rival ABC News outstripped the competition in live coverage of the event by sheer luck -- the network was broadcasting the World Series from Candlestick Park when the quake struck -- NBC News was unable to get its signal out of San Francisco for the first hour after the quake . </s>
<s> `` I have to attribute the lackluster performance to a natural disaster , '' said Mr. Premner . </s>
<s> `` So before I start to be really critical of NBC , I would like to know more about what happened . '' </s>
<s> There were no complaints from affiliates of CBS Inc. and Cable News Network , a unit of Turner Broadcasting System Inc . </s>
<s> But that was not the case at NBC News , which has been dogged with the image of not being aggressive on major breaking stories . </s>
<s> Last summer , the affiliates bitterly complained to network executives about the poor coverage of the student uprising in China . </s>
<s> `` I was not pleased with the slow start , and neither was NBC News , '' said Guy Hempel , general manager of NBC affiliate WAVE in Louisville , Ky . </s>
<s> A spokesman for National Broadcasting Co. , a unit of General Electric Co. , said the network was `` looking into what happened . '' </s>
<s> The stations said they were pleased with the extended coverage yesterday , including a special five-hour edition of `` Today . '' </s>
<s> Don Browne , director of news at NBC News , said in an interview that `` we could n't get a signal out of San Francisco . </s>
<s> We were out of the box . </s>
<s> It was horrible . </s>
<s> The comment we 're hearing is that we were slow out of the box , but beat everyone else in the stretch . '' </s>
<s> NBC broadcast throughout the entire night and did not go off the air until noon yesterday . </s>
<s> The quake postponed the third and fourth games of the World Series . </s>
<s> In place of the games , ABC said it planned to broadcast next week 's episodes of its prime-time Wednesday and Thursday lineups , except for a one-hour special on the earthquake at 10 p.m. last night . </s>
<s> The series is scheduled to resume Tuesday evening in San Francisco . </s>
<s> `` There are no commercials to make up for since we 're going to eventually broadcast the World Series , '' said a network spokesman . </s>
