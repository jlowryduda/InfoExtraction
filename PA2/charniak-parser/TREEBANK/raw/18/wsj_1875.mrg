<s> The Berlin Wall still stands . </s>
<s> But the man who built it has fallen . </s>
<s> East Germany yesterday removed Erich Honecker , one of the staunchest holdouts against the reform rumbling through the Communist world , in an effort to win back the confidence of its increasingly rebellious citizens . </s>
<s> But while it was a move that stunned the East bloc , it hardly ushers in an era of reform -- at least anytime soon . </s>
<s> For the Politburo replaced Mr. Honecker , who had led East Germany for 18 years and before that headed its security apparatus , with a man cut of the same cloth : Egon Krenz , the most recent internal-security chief and a longtime Honecker protege . </s>
<s> East Germany , it is clear , is no Poland , where the Communist Party now shares power with the democratically elected Solidarity union . </s>
<s> Nor is it a Hungary , where yesterday the parliament approved constitutional changes meant to help turn the Communist nation into a multiparty democracy . </s>
<s> Still , any change in East Germany has enormous implications , for both East and West . </s>
<s> It raises the long-cherished hopes of many Germans for reunification -- a prospect that almost equally alarms political leaders in Moscow , Washington and Western Europe . </s>
<s> Mr. Krenz , 52 , was named the new party chief just minutes after the Party 's 163-member Central Committee convened in East Berlin . </s>
<s> Although the East German news agency ADN claimed Mr. Honecker had asked to be relieved of his duties for `` health reasons , '' West German government sources said the 26-man Politburo had asked for his resignation at a separate meeting late Tuesday . </s>
<s> -LRB- Mr. Honecker was twice hospitalized this summer for a gall bladder ailment and his physical condition has been the subject of intense speculation in the Western media . -RRB- </s>
<s> ADN said Mr. Honecker , a hard-line Stalinist who in 1961 supervised the construction of the Berlin Wall , also was relieved of his title as head of state and his position as chief of the military . </s>
<s> Mr. Krenz is expected to be formally named to all three positions once the nation 's parliament convenes later this week . </s>
<s> Mr. Honecker 's ignoble fall culminates nearly two decades of iron-handed leadership during which Mr. Honecker , now 77 years old , built East Germany into the most economically advanced nation in the Soviet bloc . </s>
<s> His grip on power unraveled this summer as thousands of his countrymen , dissatisfied by the harshness of his rule , fled to the West . </s>
<s> Thousands more have taken to the streets in the last month in East Germany 's largest wave of domestic unrest since a workers ' uprising in 1953 . </s>
<s> In Washington , the Bush administration took a characteristically cautious and skeptical view of the leadership change . </s>
<s> The official line was to offer warmer ties to Mr. Krenz , provided he is willing to institute reforms . </s>
<s> But U.S. officials have strong doubts that he is a reformer . </s>
<s> President Bush told reporters : `` Whether that -LCB- the leadership change -RCB- reflects a change in East-West relations , I do n't think so . </s>
<s> Because Mr. Krenz has been very much in accord with the policies of Honecker . '' </s>
<s> One top U.S. expert on East Germany added : `` There is no clear-cut champion of reform , that we know of , in the East German leadership . '' </s>
<s> Indeed , Mr. Krenz said on East German television last night that there will be no sharing of power with pro-democracy groups . </s>
<s> He said , while dialogue is important , enough forums already exist `` in which different interests '' can express themselves . </s>
<s> The removal of Mr. Honecker was apparently the result of bitter infighting within the top ranks of the Communist party . </s>
<s> According to West German government sources , Mr. Honecker and several senior Politburo members fought over the last week to delay any decisions about a leadership change . </s>
<s> But , with public demonstrations in the country growing in size and intensity , Mr. Honecker and several key allies lost out in this battle , officials say . </s>
<s> Those allies included Politburo members Guenter Mittag , who has long headed economic affairs , and Joachim Hermann , chief of information policy . </s>
<s> Both men were also relieved of their duties yesterday . </s>
<s> Although other resignations may follow , it 's still not clear to what extent the change in party personnel will alter the government 's resistance to fundamental change . </s>
<s> Clearly , the central figure in this process is Egon Krenz . </s>
<s> Born in 1937 in a Baltic Sea town now part of Poland , he was eight years old when World War II ended . </s>
<s> Like West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl , he represents the postwar generation that has grown up during Germany 's division . </s>
<s> Since joining the Politburo in 1983 as its youngest member , Mr. Krenz had acquired the nickname `` crown prince , '' a reference to the widely held view that he was the hand-picked successor to Mr. Honecker . </s>
<s> In fact , the two men have had strikingly similar career paths , both having served as chief of internal security before their rise to the top party position . </s>
<s> Moreover , both men have hewn to a similar hard-line philosophy . </s>
<s> Notably , one of Mr. Krenz 's few official visits overseas came a few months ago , when he visited China after the massacre in Beijing . </s>
<s> He later defended the Chinese government 's response during a separate visit to West Germany . </s>
<s> East German Protestantism in particular fears Mr. Krenz , in part because of an incident in January 1988 when he was believed to have ordered the arrest of hundreds of dissidents who had sought refuge in the Church . </s>
<s> However , Mr. Krenz also has a reputation for being politically savvy . </s>
<s> His shrewd ability to read the shifting popular mood in East Germany is best illustrated by his apparent break with his old mentor , Mr. Honecker . </s>
<s> Indeed , according to West German government sources , he was one of the leaders in the power struggle that toppled Mr. Honecker . </s>
<s> In recent days , Mr. Krenz has sought to project a kinder image . </s>
<s> According to a report widely circulating in East Berlin , it was Mr. Krenz who ordered police to stop using excessive force against demonstrators in Leipzig . </s>
<s> `` He does n't want to have the image of the gun man , '' says Fred Oldenburg , an expert at the Bonn-sponsored Institute of East European and International Studies in Cologne . </s>
<s> `` He 's not a reformer -- he wants to have the image of a reformer . '' </s>
<s> As part of his image polishing , Mr. Krenz is expected to take modest steps toward reform to rebuild confidence among the people and reassert the party 's authority . </s>
<s> Besides sacking other senior Politburo officials who allied themselves with Mr. Honecker , Mr. Krenz could loosen controls on the news media , free up travel restrictions , and establish a dialogue with various dissident groups . </s>
<s> But will it be enough ? </s>
<s> West German government officials and Western analysts are doubtful . </s>
<s> `` He does n't signify what people want , so the unrest will go on , '' Mr. Oldenburg predicts . </s>
<s> At the same time , the expectations of the East German people are great and will continue to grow . </s>
<s> Says one West German official : `` What 's necessary now is the process of democratization . </s>
<s> Not just that people are being heard but that their interests are being taken seriously . '' </s>
<s> Chancellor Kohl , meanwhile , has invited Mr. Krenz to open discussions with Bonn on a wide range of subjects . </s>
<s> Reports in the West German press , citing sources in East Germany , suggest Mr. Krenz may serve only as a bridge between Mr. Honecker and a genuine reform leader . </s>
<s> Adding to that speculation is Mr. Krenz 's reputation as a heavy drinker , who is said to also suffer from diabetes . </s>
<s> `` This is a dynamic process and we 're experiencing the first step , '' the Bonn official adds . </s>
<s> The selection of Mr. Krenz may also disappoint Moscow . </s>
<s> Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has pressed hard for a change in East Germany 's rigid stance . </s>
<s> Two reform-minded party leaders favored by Moscow as possible successors to Mr. Honecker , Dresden party secretary Hans Modrow and Politburo member Guenter Schabowski , were passed over . </s>
<s> If Mr. Krenz sticks to rigid policies the pressure from the Soviet Union could intensify . </s>
<s> In Moscow , Mr. Gorbachev sent Mr. Krenz a congratulatory telegram that appeared to urge the new leadership to heed growing calls for change . </s>
<s> According to the Soviet news agency Tass , `` Gorbachev expressed the conviction that the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of -LCB- East -RCB- Germany , being sensitive to the demands of the time , ... will find solutions to complicated problems the GDR -LCB- German Democratic Republic -RCB- encountered . '' </s>
<s> A force of younger pro-Gorbachev members in the East German bureaucracy has for some time been pushing for relaxation within their country . </s>
<s> The older generation has been torn between a fear of tampering with the status quo and a fear of what might happen if they did n't . </s>
<s> From the perspective of East Germany 's old guard , reforms that smack of capitalism and Western-style democracy could eliminate their country 's reason for being . </s>
<s> Unlike the other nations of the bloc , East Germany is a creature of the Cold War . </s>
<s> Erasing the differences still dividing Europe , and the vast international reordering that implies , wo n't endanger the statehood of a Poland or a Hungary . </s>
<s> But it could ultimately lead to German reunification and the disappearance of East Germany from the map . </s>
<s> Which is what the Old Guard fears . </s>
<s> `` I 'm sure they 'll formulate a reform that will be a recipe for the GDR 's future as a separately identifiable state , '' says Michael Simmons , a British journalist whose book on East Germany , entitled `` The Unloved Country , '' was published this month . </s>
<s> Up to now , that recipe has consisted of a dogged effort by former leader Walter Ulbricht to establish the country 's international legitimacy , followed by Mr. Honecker 's campaign to build the East bloc 's only successful Stalinist economy into a consumer paradise . </s>
<s> Neither man achieved perfection . </s>
<s> Early in 1987 , Mr. Honecker and his team stopped paying thin compliments to Mr. Gorbachev and joined with Romania in rejecting any necessity for adjustments in their systems . </s>
<s> The less-self-confident Czechoslovaks and Bulgarians , in contrast , declared their intentions to reform , while doing nothing concrete about it . </s>
<s> The East German media soon began presenting Mr. Gorbachev 's speeches only as sketchy summaries , and giving space to his opponents . </s>
<s> By late 1988 , they were banning Soviet publications . </s>
<s> The country abandoned its former devotion to socialist unity and took to insisting instead that each country in the bloc ought to travel its own road . </s>
<s> Mr. Honecker spoke of `` generally valid objective laws of socialism '' and left no room for debate . </s>
<s> With this year 's dislocations in China and the Soviet Union , and the drive to democracy in Poland and Hungary , the East German leadership grew still more defensive . </s>
<s> Politburo member Joachim Herrman confessed to a `` grave concern '' over Hungarian democracy . </s>
<s> `` Under the banner that proclaims the ` renewal of socialism , ' '' he said , `` forces are at work that are striving to eliminate socialism . '' </s>
<s> Some loyal voices , in and out of the East German Communist party , saw the nation 's unrest coming . </s>
<s> The first signs were economic . </s>
<s> Despite heavily subsidized consumer industries , East Germans have for years watched the West pull farther out ahead . </s>
<s> In 1988 , for the first time , economic growth came to a dead stop . </s>
<s> Gingerly , some economists began to blame central planning . </s>
<s> Some writers in theoretical journals even raised the notion of introducing democracy , at least in the workplace . </s>
<s> By summer , an independent reform movement was saying out loud what it had only whispered before . </s>
<s> But they are stalwart socialists . </s>
<s> Their proclaimed purpose is to cleanse East Germany of its Stalinist muck , not to merge with the West . </s>
<s> One of their pastors has envisioned a `` new utopia '' of `` creative socialism . '' </s>
<s> Meanwhile , the man Mr. Krenz replaces has left an indelible mark on East German society . </s>
<s> Imprisoned by the Nazis during World War II for his political beliefs , Mr. Honecker typified the postwar generation of committed Communist leaders in Eastern Europe who took their cues from Moscow . </s>
<s> He was a `` socialist warrior '' who felt rankled by West Germany 's enormous postwar prosperity and the Bonn government 's steadfast refusal to recognize the legitimacy of his state . </s>
<s> Finally , during his first and only state visit to Bonn two years ago , he won some measure of the recognition he had long sought . </s>
<s> But ultimately he was undone by forces unleashed by his own comrade , Mr. Gorbachev . </s>
<s> Mr. Honecker 's removal `` was bound to happen , '' says one aide to Chancellor Kohl . </s>
<s> `` It was only a matter of time . '' </s>
<s> The European Community Commission increased its forecast for economic growth in the EC in 1989 to 3.5 % , slightly higher than its June projection of 3.25 % . </s>

<s> EC inflation was seen at 4.8 % in 1989 , higher than 1988 's 3.6 % price rise . </s>

<s> Slower growth countries included Greece , at 2.5 % , the U.K. , at 2.25 % , and Denmark , at 1.75 % . </s>
<s> Inflation is expected to be highest in Greece , where it is projected at 14.25 % , and Portugal , at 13 % . </s>
<s> At the other end of the spectrum , West German inflation was forecast at 3 % in 1989 and 2.75 % in 1990 . </s>

<s> The charges are the culmination of weeks of rumors concerning CDL that have depressed the company 's share price and to a lesser extent the shares of all companies owned by CDL 's controlling Quek family , brokers in Singapore say . </s>
<s> The Queks control the Hong Leong Group , which has widespread interests in manufacturing , property and finance in both Malaysia and Singapore . </s>
