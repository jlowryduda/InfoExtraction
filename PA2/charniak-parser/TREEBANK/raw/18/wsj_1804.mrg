<s> Whitbread & Co. put its spirits division up for sale , triggering a scramble among global groups for the British company 's brands . </s>
<s> Whitbread already has been approached by `` about half a dozen '' companies interested in buying all or part of the spirits business , a spokesman said . </s>
<s> Analysts expect the spirits operations and some California vineyards that also are being sold to fetch about # 500 million -LRB- $ 788.8 million -RRB- . </s>
<s> Among the brands for sale are Beefeater gin , the No. 2 imported gin in the U.S. , and Laphroaig single-malt whiskey . </s>
<s> Also for sale are Buckingham Wile Co. , which distributes Cutty Sark blended whiskey in the U.S. , and Whitbread 's Atlas Peak Vineyards in California 's Napa Valley . </s>
<s> Beefeater alone is worth as much as # 300 million , analysts said . </s>
<s> Whitbread bought the Beefeater distillery two years ago for # 174.5 million . </s>
<s> That purchase represented an attempt by Whitbread , a venerable British brewer , to become a major player in the global liquor business . </s>
<s> But Whitbread has been squeezed by giant rivals amid widespread consolidation in the industry . </s>
<s> Now , it wants to concentrate on beer and its newer hotel and restaurant operations . </s>
<s> For rival liquor companies , the Whitbread auction is a rare opportunity to acquire valuable brands . </s>
<s> `` It 's not very often something like this comes up , '' said Ron Littleboy , a liquor company analyst at Nomura Research Institute in London . </s>
<s> `` The division will be sold off quite rapidly , '' predicted Neill Junor , an analyst at London brokers County NatWest WoodMac . </s>
<s> Among possible buyers , Grand Metropolitan PLC might find Beefeater a useful addition to its portfolio . </s>
<s> Grand Met owns Bombay gin , the No. 3 imported gin in the U.S. ; rival Guinness PLC has the No. 1 imported brand , Tanqueray . </s>
<s> The Whitbread spirits auction `` is an extremely interesting development ... and naturally we 'll be considering it carefully , '' a Grand Met spokesman said . </s>
<s> Guinness , which owns several leading whiskey brands plus Gordon 's gin , the world 's No. 1 gin , is considered less likely to bid for the Whitbread spirits . </s>
<s> A Guinness spokesman declined to comment . </s>
<s> Two other global liquor giants , Canada 's Seagram Co. and Britain 's Allied-Lyons PLC , also are possible buyers . </s>
<s> Seagram 's gin is the world 's No. 2 gin brand , but the company does n't own any of the major gin brands imported in the U.S. . </s>
<s> Allied-Lyons , while powerful in whiskey , does n't own any major white-spirit brands . </s>
<s> `` We will certainly have to take a look at '' the Whitbread spirits business , an Allied-Lyons spokesman said . </s>
<s> `` We would certainly like to have a major white-spirits brand in our portfolio . '' </s>
<s> A Seagram spokesman in New York would n't comment . </s>
<s> Smaller liquor companies , such as Brown-Forman Corp. and American Brands Inc. of the U.S. , also are likely to be interested . </s>
<s> Such companies `` are increasingly being left behind '' in the global liquor business , says Nomura 's Mr. Littleboy . </s>
<s> In New York , a spokesman for American Brands would n't comment . </s>
<s> Brown-Forman , a Louisville , Ky. distiller , also declined to comment . </s>
<s> Whitbread 's wine , spirits and soft-drink operations had trading profit of # 35.4 million on sales of # 315.5 million in the year ended Feb. 25 . </s>
<s> The company , which is retaining most of its wine and all of its soft-drink interests , did n't break out results for the businesses it plans to sell . </s>
<s> But analysts estimate their trading profit at # 30 million . </s>
<s> Whitbread had total pretax profit in the year ended Feb. 25 of # 223.2 million , on sales of # 2.26 billion . </s>
<s> Whitbread 's spirits auction occurs amid a parallel shakeup in the British beer industry . </s>
<s> Earlier this year , the government announced plans to foster increased competition in the industry . </s>
<s> British brewers currently own thousands of pubs , which in turn sell only the breweries ' beer and soft drinks . </s>
<s> Under new rules , many of the country 's pubs would become `` free houses , '' selling beers of their choice . </s>
<s> Whitbread now intends to bolster its brewing interests , in an effort to grab a share of sales to free houses . </s>
<s> The company , which last month paid # 50.7 million for regional British brewer Boddington Group PLC , has about 13 % of the British beer market . </s>
<s> Whitbread also owns the license to brew and distribute Heineken and Stella Artois beers in Britain . </s>
<s> In addition , Whitbread intends to focus on its newer hotel , liquor store and restaurant businesses in Europe and North America . </s>
<s> In Britain , those interests include the Beefeater steakhouse chain and joint ownership with PepsiCo Inc. of the country 's Pizza Hut chain . </s>
<s> In Canada and the U.S. , Whitbread owns The Keg chain of steak and seafood restaurants . </s>
<s> Focusing on beer , restaurants and hotels means `` we can concentrate our skills and resources more effectively , '' Peter Jarvis , Whitbread 's managing director , said in a statement . </s>
<s> The spirits business `` would require substantial additional investment to enable it to compete effectively in the first division of global players . '' </s>
<s> Whitbread also announced that Mr. Jarvis , who is 48 , will become the company 's chief executive March 1 . </s>
<s> At that time Sam Whitbread , the company 's chairman and a descendant of its 18th-century founder , will retire from executive duties . </s>
<s> He will retain the honorary title of non-executive chairman . </s>
