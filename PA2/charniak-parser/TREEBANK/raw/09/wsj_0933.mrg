<s> TAX SHELTERS CALLED Individual Retirement Accounts , or `` IRAs , '' were created without fanfare on Sept. 2 , 1974 , but grew beyond expectations as an inducement to personal saving . </s>

<s> That year a four-man group headed by William Lieber in the Legislation and Regulations division of the Office of the Chief Counsel for the Internal Revenue Service , was assigned the task of designing a plan . </s>
<s> They used the 1962 Keogh Plan , a pension plan created by a New York congressman for the self-employed , as a partial model . </s>
<s> This team initially called its new model Personal Retirement Account , or `` PRA . '' </s>
