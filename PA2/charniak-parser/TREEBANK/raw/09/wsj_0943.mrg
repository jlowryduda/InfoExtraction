<s> Bell Atlantic Corp. said it agreed definitively to acquire one of Control Data Corp. 's computer-maintenance businesses . </s>
<s> Terms of the accord were n't disclosed . </s>
<s> Control Data 's third-party maintenance unit services products primarily made by Digital Equipment Corp. and International Business Machines Corp . </s>
<s> The unit has 6,000 customers and , according to one analyst , had 1988 revenue of about $ 85 million . </s>
<s> Under the agreement , which had been widely expected , Bell Atlantic would be buying Control Data 's customer base and its approximately 100 U.S. maintenance facilities in about 33 cities . </s>
<s> However , Control Data would continue to provide maintenance services for customers of its Cyber product line . </s>
<s> The unit represents a small portion of Minneapolis-based Control Data 's overall computer-servicing business , which last year posted sales of about $ 400 million . </s>
<s> Earlier this year , the company sold a similar unit in Europe for about $ 25 million . </s>
<s> Lawrence Perlman , Control Data 's president and chief operating officer , said the maintenance business no longer fits into the company 's `` strategy to be a data solutions company . '' </s>
<s> Thomas Vassiliades , president of Bell Atlantic 's customer services division , said the acquisition would give the company 's Sorbus computer-maintenance unit added expertise in `` the increasingly sophisticated workstation and high-end mainframe technologies . </s>
