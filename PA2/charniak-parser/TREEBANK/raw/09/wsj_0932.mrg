<s> The amount of blood surgical patients can donate and store before surgery can be increased by the new genetically engineered drug , EPO . </s>
<s> EPO , or erythropoietin , is a protein the human body makes to stimulate the growth of red blood cells . </s>
<s> A genetically engineered version of the human protein developed by Amgen Corp. of Thousand Oaks , Calif. , recently has been marketed by the Ortho Pharmaceuticals division of Johnson & Johnson . </s>
<s> A competing version of EPO is being developed by Genetics Institute Inc. in Cambridge , Mass . </s>
<s> The drug is being used primarily to treat anemias . </s>
<s> A new experiment , reported in this week 's New England Journal of Medicine , involved giving injections of Amgen 's EPO to 23 patients who wanted to store units of their own blood . </s>
<s> The patients began receiving EPO injections about a month before their scheduled surgery . </s>
<s> They then began donating blood twice a week , receiving an EPO injection each time . </s>
<s> If tests indicated a low number of red cells , blood was n't taken . </s>
<s> The EPO-treated patients donated an average of 5.4 units of blood each compared with only 4.1 units donated by a similar group of surgical patients who received a placebo injection . </s>
<s> The volume of red cells donated by the EPO-treated patients was 41 % higher per donor , the research team representing a number of hospitals and blood banks reported . </s>
