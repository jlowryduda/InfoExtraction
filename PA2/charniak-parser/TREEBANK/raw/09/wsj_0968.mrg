<s> National Convenience Stores Inc. , trying to shake the doldrums in the convenience-store business , said it will rearrange the merchandise in all of its stores in the next 18 months to cater better to the neighborhoods around its stores . </s>
<s> As part of the plan , the Houston-based company 's 1,100 Stop 'N Go stores will be refocused to target black , Hispanic , upscale or core middle-class customers . </s>
<s> Stores in upper-income neighborhoods , for instance , will carry high-priced wines , publications such as Vanity Fair , gourmet pasta sauces , oat bran cereals and Weight Watchers and Pritikin products . </s>
<s> Stores in Hispanic areas will stock an assortment of Spanish-language magazines , Mexican cooking items and candies . </s>
<s> Stores in the company 's core middle-class market will get more frozen and quick-to-prepare foods and a greater selection of bottled water . </s>
<s> V.H. Van Horn , National Convenience president and chief executive officer , said the move reflects the company 's realization that the industry 's poor performance stems from its failure to give customers what they want -- rather than from increasing competition from gasoline stations and 24-hour grocery stores . </s>
<s> `` Convenience store merchandise has not kept pace with current trends in consumer preferences , '' he said in a speech at the company 's annual shareholders meeting . </s>
<s> Analysts and competitors said the move reflects a growing need by the stores to expand their customer base beyond the traditional blue-collar worker who pops into a convenience store for a sandwich , cigarettes , soda or beer . </s>
<s> `` There are an increasing number of people out there who are time-poor , '' said Chris Vroom , retail analyst with Alex . Brown & Sons of Baltimore . </s>
<s> `` Those are primarily white-collar workers , a customer segment that has historically proved elusive for convenience stores . '' </s>
<s> National Convenience 's move is likely to be echoed by other chains , though analysts note that Southland Corp. , owner of 7-Eleven stores , and Circle K Corp. are too debt-heavy to roll out such an extensive effort . </s>
<s> Still , Southland said that its franchisees have been targeting their merchandise to their customers for years , and that the company has begun to follow suit . </s>
<s> For instance , Southland has expanded its bottled water selection in some stores and added fresh sandwiches in some outlets . </s>
<s> Several months ago , it also added black health and beauty aids displays to many stores , a spokeswoman said . </s>
<s> `` We certainly see an increasing trend toward that , '' she added . </s>
<s> National Convenience said it has tested its new merchandise mix in 100 stores , with favorable results . </s>
<s> Analysts said the company 's effort will be helped by its decision last year to put point-of-sale scanners in 200 stores , allowing National Convenience to quickly track items that are selling and those that are n't . </s>
<s> To promote its new strategy , National Convenience said it plans to spend about $ 12 million on advertising for the year ending June 30 , up from about $ 10 million in fiscal 1989 . </s>
