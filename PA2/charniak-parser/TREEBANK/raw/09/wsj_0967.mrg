<s> Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc. , a unit of Daimler-Benz AG , paid Massachusetts $ 9.1 million in taxes , bringing to an end a 10-month-long corporate tax chase . </s>
<s> Officials at the Department of Revenue had dogged the foreign car maker for taxes owed on business transactions and were proceeding to settle the dispute in court . </s>
<s> But `` the check arrived in the mail , '' said Stephen Kidder , Massachusetts Commissioner of Revenue . </s>
<s> Mercedes-Benz , which had said it did n't owe taxes to Massachusetts partly because it sells its cars at a dock in Baltimore and not in Massachusetts , did n't explain its change of heart . </s>
<s> Last month , Mercedes-Benz executives approached state revenue officials complaining about bad press , the commissioner said . </s>
<s> The dispute was the subject of a Wall Street Journal article in August . </s>
<s> The amount covers taxes , interest and penalties owed from 1966 , when the state began collecting corporate taxes , to 1985 . </s>
<s> Mercedes-Benz also agreed to pay taxes owed for the years 1986 through 1988 , Mr. Kidder added . </s>
<s> Under Massachusetts tax laws , corporations must pay 9.5 % of estimated profits resulting from business transactions in the state if the company conducts a variety of non-sales activities , including warranties , customer complaints and relations with independent dealerships . </s>
