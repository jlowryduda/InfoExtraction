<s> Qintex Entertainment also said Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Jonathan Lloyd , 37 years old , would join the nine-member board . </s>
<s> He succeeds Roger Kimmel , who resigned last week saying his participation in evaluating the company 's role in buying MGM\/UA Communications Co. was no longer necessary . </s>
<s> Mr. Evans will stay until a successor is found , but not later than the end of the year , the company said . </s>
<s> It was the 49-year-old Mr. Evans who had moved into the offices of MGM\/UA and run the company during Qintex Australia Ltd. 's aborted bid for the movie company . </s>

<s> And the relationship between Qintex Entertainment and the Australian company appears to be quickly deteriorating . </s>

<s> Qintex Entertainment was depending on Qintex Australia to arrange financing . </s>
<s> But early on Oct. 19 , the second of two hectic days of board meetings , Mr. Evans said he believed Qintex Australia would n't be forthcoming . </s>
<s> He recommended that the company file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code before the MCA deadline , according to a source familiar with the sessions . </s>
<s> But a majority of the board , which includes three members from the Australian company , overrode him . </s>
<s> Mr. Evans resigned . </s>
<s> Later in the day , according to the source , the board reversed itself , decided to file for bankruptcy protection , and asked Mr. Evans to stay on . </s>
<s> Mr. Evans told the board he needed the weekend to think about it . </s>

<s> Last Monday , Qintex Australia announced a restructuring plan and said it would sell off assets . </s>
<s> Last week the company indicated it would cut back on the working capital it would supply to Qintex Entertainment . </s>
<s> Separately , a Qintex Entertainment shareholder filed suit in federal court in Los Angeles charging Qintex Australia with misleading shareholders about Qintex Entertainment 's financial position . </s>
<s> Qintex Australia said it had n't seen the suit and could n't comment . </s>
