<s> One day after Delmed Inc. made top management changes and disclosed the end of an important business tie , its stock did n't trade and the company forecast a `` significant '' drop next year in sales of its core product . </s>
<s> That disclosure came , a Delmed spokeswoman said , after the American Stock Exchange alerted the company that trading would n't resume in its stock until additional information about developments was provided . </s>
<s> In addition to the forecast , the company also said it is examining potential cost cuts and reductions in overhead . </s>
<s> The spokeswoman said the exchange would resume trading of Delmed stock today . </s>
<s> Delmed , which makes and sells peritoneal dialysis products used in treating kidney disease , on Tuesday announced the resignations of Robert S. Ehrlich , chairman , president and chief executive officer , and of Leslie I. Shapiro , chief operating officer and chief financial officer . </s>
<s> They were succeeded by executives of Fresenius USA Inc. and its parent , Fresenius AG , which owns about 45 % of Delmed . </s>
<s> At the same time , the New Brunswick , N.J. , company said negotiations about pricing and volumes of product had collapsed between it and its exclusive distributor in the U.S. , National Medical Care Inc . </s>
<s> Following that announcement Tuesday , however , company officials were unavailable to elaborate . </s>
<s> Yesterday , the spokeswoman said sales of Delmed products through the exclusive arrangement with National Medical accounted for 87 % of Delmed 's 1988 sales of $ 21.1 million . </s>
<s> The current distribution arrangement ends in March 1990 , although Delmed said it will continue to provide some supplies of the peritoneal dialysis products to National Medical , the spokeswoman said . </s>
<s> Nonetheless , `` Delmed currently expects that 1990 sales ... will be significantly below their 1989 level , '' the company said in a statement . </s>
<s> Delmed said yesterday that Fresenius USA would begin distributing the product and that the company is investigating other possible distribution channels . </s>
<s> In any case , supplies to patients wo n't be interrupted , the company added . </s>
<s> Fresenius , a West German pharmaceutical concern , has been discussing a transaction in which it would buy Delmed stock for cash to bring its beneficial ownership to between 70 % and 80 % . </s>
<s> The transaction also would combine Fresenius USA and Delmed . </s>
<s> But the plan now is being `` reformulated , '' Delmed said , declining to provide most of the new terms of the combination . </s>
<s> Said the spokeswoman : `` The whole structure has changed . </s>
<s> The value of the company has changed . '' </s>
<s> Delmed did say that the proposal still would infuse cash into Delmed but less than the $ 10 million originally expected . </s>
<s> Delmed also would receive the North American rights to certain Fresenius AG products . </s>
<s> Another option for Delmed , the company said , is that it could sell its plant in Ogden , Utah . </s>
<s> It added that no discussions about such a sale are under way . </s>
