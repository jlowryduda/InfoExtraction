<s> The White House has decided to push for changes in pesticide law that are designed to speed the removal of harmful chemicals from the nation 's food supply . </s>
<s> The proposed changes , which are scheduled to be announced today , would apply to pesticides and other substances found on fresh and processed foods , according to federal officials . </s>
<s> Environmental groups have been calling for faster action on dangerous pesticides and may welcome part of the proposal . </s>
<s> But they are already objecting to , among other things , a plan to give more weight to cost-benefit considerations in evaluating pesticides . </s>
<s> `` It 's a tremendous disappointment , '' said Janet Hathaway , an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council . </s>
<s> `` Allowing the EPA to condone continued use of a chemical whenever the benefits outweigh the risks is absolutely anathema to the environmental community . '' </s>
<s> The Bush administration plans to announce a series of principles and to work with congressional leaders in writing specific legislative proposals that embody them . </s>
<s> The principles would give the Environmental Protection Agency increased authority and flexibility in regulating pesticides , with the aim of enabling the agency to move more quickly . </s>
<s> There already are proposals pending in Congress to overhaul pesticide law . </s>
<s> Moves to accelerate the removal of dangerous pesticides gained new impetus during this year 's Alar scare , when the EPA was harshly criticized for failing to yank the possible carcinogen , a growth regulator used to make apples redder and crunchier . </s>
<s> The agency has since acted to remove Alar from the nation 's grocery shelves by May 31 , 1991 , and the apple industry has said that growers already have stopped using the chemical . </s>
<s> In addition , the principles attempt to eliminate the so-called Delaney Paradox . </s>
<s> Under the Delaney clause , which applies to processed food , a chemical is banned if it causes cancer in laboratory animals . </s>
<s> Under other laws applying to pesticide use , however , that same chemical could be allowed to be used on fresh food if it fell within the EPA 's tolerance level . </s>
<s> Among other changes , the White House wants to : </s>
<s> -- Give the EPA more flexibility to declare a pesticide an imminent hazard and pull it from the marketplace . </s>
<s> -- Speed up the process for removing a pesticide that is n't an imminent hazard . </s>
<s> -- Bar states from setting more stringent tolerance levels for a pesticide once the federal government has set a standard . </s>
<s> -- Give the EPA added discretion to set `` negligible risk '' levels for pesticide residues in processed food . </s>
<s> Chemicals that exceed these risk levels would be barred , but those that fall below these levels would be allowed . </s>
<s> -- Allow the EPA to permit the continued use of pesticides that exceed its negligible risk standard if the benefits of doing so outweigh the cost . </s>
