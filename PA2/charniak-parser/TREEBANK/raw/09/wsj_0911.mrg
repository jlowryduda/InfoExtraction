<s> Robert H. Knight 's Oct. 5 editorial-page article bemoaning violence in comedy movies -LRB- `` Hollywood , You Slay Me '' -RRB- is interesting , but somewhat off-base . </s>
<s> As a fan of older movies from the 1920s on , I do not find modern comedies contain violence , sex and foul language to any greater degree than other recent movies . </s>
<s> Older movies have plenty of violence , though it is portrayed in keeping with the more restrictive social conventions of the time . </s>
<s> For example , one of my favorite movies is the 1949 British comedy `` Kind Hearts and Coronets , '' in which the entire comedy is based on actor Dennis Price 's murdering eight titled relatives -LRB- all played by Alec Guinness -RRB- because they snubbed his mother and stand in the way of his acquiring the family title . </s>
<s> Similarly , one of the most popular comedy genres of the 1930s and '40s was the `` murder mystery\/comedy . '' </s>
<s> The `` Thin Man '' series of movies , as well as many others , based their entire comedic appeal on the star detectives ' witty quips and puns as other characters in the movies were murdered . </s>
<s> Further , I think Mr. Knight made a poor choice in picking `` A Fish Called Wanda '' as an example of the deplorable state of modern comedy movies . </s>
<s> The specific scene he mentions in which pet dogs are crushed is somewhat reminiscent of the continual plights that befall the coyote in the old Warner Bros . `` Road Runner '' cartoons . </s>
<s> There is no slow-motion close-up , blood-and-guts portrayal of the animal 's demise . </s>
<s> Keep in mind that this is the same movie in which a character is flattened by a steamroller only to pop right back up and peer in the window of a Boeing 747 -- from the outside -- as it takes off . </s>
<s> I will be the first to agree that there is much to be found wrong with modern movie making . </s>
<s> Many modern scriptwriters seem to be incapable of writing drama , or anything else , without foul-mouthed cursing . </s>
<s> Sex and violence are routinely included even when they are irrelevant to the script , and high-tech special effects are continually substituted for good plot and character development . </s>
<s> In short , we have a movie and television industry that is either incapable or petrified of making a movie unless it carries a PG-13 or R rating . </s>
<s> Hence copious amounts of gratuitous sex , violence and gutter language are included as a crutch . </s>
<s> However , these faults are not the exclusive property of modern comedies , and I believe Mr. Knight errs when he attempts to link this modern phenomenon too closely to a single category of movie making . </s>
