<s> Sears , Roebuck & Co. signed a contract with Bob Vila , the former host of the popular public television program `` This Old House , '' to star in a half-hour home improvement show sponsored by the giant retailer . </s>
<s> The do-it-yourself show , slated to start airing by June 1990 , marks Sears 's entry into the burgeoning market of home repair television programs and could bolster sales of its home improvement products . </s>
<s> In recent months , sales of home improvement items have sagged , along with sales of other big ticket durable goods . </s>
<s> The show also signals Mr. Vila 's return as a television celebrity . </s>
<s> Earlier this year , public television station WGBH in Boston fired Mr. Vila after a sponsor protested some of his numerous commercial endorsements . </s>
<s> With Mr. Vila as host , `` This Old House '' became one of the Public Broadcasting Service 's top 10 programs , airing weekly on about 300 of the network 's stations and seen by an average of 12 million viewers . </s>
<s> But Home Depot Inc. , an Atlanta-based home center chain , objected when Mr. Vila started doing commercial endorsements for Rickel Home Centers , a New Jersey building supply company that competes with Home Depot in some markets . </s>
<s> `` I 'm ecstatic about the change , '' said Mr. Vila , whose new syndicated program is called `` Home Again with Bob Vila . '' </s>
<s> In an interview , Mr. Vila criticized his old show , which is continuing with a new host . </s>
<s> `` Public TV is in fantasy land , '' he said . </s>
<s> `` Last season , we did a story that involved spending $ 700,000 in converting a two-family house into a bed and breakfast . '' </s>
<s> In the new show , he said , `` we 're going to spend $ 60,000 building a start-up house '' for a young couple . </s>
<s> While Sears would n't comment on the brouhaha over Mr. Vila 's commercial endorsements , it appears to be building a fence around Mr. Vila 's affections . </s>
<s> His contract makes him `` exclusive '' spokesman for Sears 's home improvement marketing campaigns . </s>
<s> Ogilvy & Mather in Chicago , a unit of WPP Group PLC , will handle the advertising account and syndication . </s>
<s> The only other endorsement permitted by the contract involves a series of Time-Life home improvement and repair books . </s>
<s> His other agreements to promote products have expired . </s>
<s> Little matter for Mr. Vila , who complains that `` public TV never paid me more than $ 40,000 a year . '' </s>
<s> He said his compensation under the Sears contract is `` a multimillion dollar deal . </s>
