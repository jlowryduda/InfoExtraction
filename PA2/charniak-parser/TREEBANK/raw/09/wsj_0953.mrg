<s> In the bidding war for Public Service Co. of New Hampshire , United Illuminating Co. raised its proposed offer to one it valued at $ 2.29 billion from $ 2.19 billion , apparently topping all other bidders . </s>
<s> The bids remain subject to evaluation by the federal bankruptcy court supervising PS of New Hampshire 's reorganization . </s>
<s> They are also indirectly subject to approval by the state of New Hampshire , where residents fear soaring rates to pay for the cost of reorganization . </s>
<s> Each of the four parties bidding for PS of New Hampshire proposes a complex financial package to satisfy creditors and shareholders and also proposes a formula to limit rate increases to satisfy the state . </s>
<s> The new round of bidding would seem to complicate the decision making for Judge James Yacos , the bankruptcy judge overseeing the case , because the company 's stockholders , unsecured creditors and regulators each are currently backing different plans . </s>
<s> In addition , some of the proposals are so close , that non-financial issues such as timing may play a more important role . </s>
<s> The unsecured creditors agreed in principle to support New Haven , Conn.-based United Illuminating 's new bid . </s>
<s> They previously had backed an internal reorganization plan proposed by PS of New Hampshire . </s>
<s> All of the bidders contemplate full payment including interest to secured creditors . </s>
<s> United Illuminating 's plan , however , offers more for unsecured creditors . </s>
<s> Geoffrey Kalmus , counsel to the official creditors committee , said that under the United Illuminating plan , unsecured creditors would be paid in full credits and interest of about $ 855 million , accrued before PS of New Hampshire 's Jan. 1988 filing for bankruptcy court protection . </s>
<s> In addition , they would receive some $ 200 million in payments for interest since then . </s>
<s> Mr. Kalmus said that by next July they would have accrued unpaid interest equal to $ 350 million . </s>
<s> Other plans generally would n't pay unsecured creditors ' interest accrued since the filing . </s>
<s> Under United Illuminating 's plan , a new holding company would be formed to own the two companies . </s>
<s> It would be 72%-owned by United Illuminating holders and 28%-owned by current holders of PS of New Hampshire preferred and common stock . </s>
<s> PS of New Hampshire preferred holders also would get certain debentures and preferred stock . </s>
<s> United Illuminating said the preferred holders total package would equal about 60 % of their claims . </s>
<s> Common shareholders would end up owning about 6.4 % of the combined company . </s>
<s> As previously reported , Northeast Utilities , Hartford , Conn. , Monday filed a bid it valued at $ 2.25 billion . </s>
<s> That offer was endorsed by the shareholders committee . </s>
<s> The other bidders , New England Electric System , Westboro , Mass. , and PS of New Hampshire , did n't change the value of their bids , although PS of New Hampshire changed its rate proposal . </s>
<s> New England Electric values its offer at $ 2 billion and PS of New Hampshire values its reorganization plan at $ 2.2 billion . </s>
<s> The bankruptcy judge has ruled that federal bankruptcy laws could be used to circumvent state regulation . </s>
<s> However , creditors and bidders alike concede that the state plays a major role because it could significantly delay final settlement of a plan it did n't like . </s>
<s> The state has endorsed the New England Electric plan , which promises to limit rate increases to 4.8 % annually for seven years . </s>
<s> Northeast Utilities ' plan proposes 5.5 % annual increases . </s>
<s> PS of New Hampshire amended its plan to call for two years of 5.5 % rate increases followed by five years of 4.5 % increases . </s>
<s> Fuel cost adjustments could change the effective rate increases , however . </s>
<s> Previously it had proposed seven years of 5.5 % increases . </s>
<s> United Illuminating also amended its rate plan . </s>
<s> The new offer assumes just five years of 5.5 % rate increases , to be followed by state-approved increases under the usual hearing procedure . </s>
<s> Previously United Illuminating had also called for seven years of 5.5 % increases . </s>
<s> The bids and rate proposals generally assume the Seabrook nuclear power plant , which is completed , will go into operation . </s>

<s> In New York Stock Exchange trading , PS of New Hampshire 's 17 1\/2 debenture due 2004 closed yesterday at $ 82.50 , up $ 2 . </s>
<s> The utility 's stock closed at $ 4 a share , up 37.5 cents , in composite trading on the Big Board . </s>
