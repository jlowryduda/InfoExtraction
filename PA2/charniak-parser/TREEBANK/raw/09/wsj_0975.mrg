<s> A proposed conflict-of-interest policy for federally funded biomedical researchers may thwart many high-technology new ventures , say financiers , researchers and university administrators . </s>
<s> The National Institutes of Health policy would require researchers to cut financial ties with health-care businesses -- or lose their government money . </s>
<s> Among other concerns , the agency says researchers with business ties are more likely to falsify findings in order to tout new drugs . </s>
<s> As ties between academia and venture capital have blossomed in recent years , governmental fear of abuse has risen . </s>
<s> But the guidelines could `` make it impossible to commercialize research , '' says Kenneth Smith , associate provost and vice president for research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology . </s>
<s> The NIH is asking grant recipients and others for comments on the proposed guidelines until Dec. 15 . </s>
<s> After that , it will make a final decision on the policy . </s>
<s> The guidelines could foil future arrangements similar to the deal behind Lithox Inc. , a Salem , Mass. , start-up , says Robert Daly , a managing partner of TA Associates , a venture-capital firm . </s>
<s> With $ 2.3 million , he and other investors launched Lithox last year to market a gallstone cure being developed by researchers of the University of California at San Diego . </s>
<s> The researchers , who are being financed by the Lithox funds , will receive a royalty , or percentage of sales , if their research yields a commercial product . </s>
<s> But because the University of California , like many other universities , shares its royalties with researchers , it may disqualify itself from federal funds under the proposed guidelines , Mr. Daly says . </s>
<s> The high-tech industry is full of the kind of arrangement that the new guidelines would affect . </s>
<s> For instance , Commonwealth BioVentures Inc. , a venture-capital concern , last month invested $ 600,000 to launch Amira Inc. , a Worcester , Mass. , concern that will produce pharmaceuticals . </s>
<s> Scientists Rima Kaddurah-Daouk and Paul Schimmel conducted the initial research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . </s>
<s> While Ms. Kaddurah-Daouk left MIT to head Amira , Prof. Schimmel will continue to work at MIT , serve on Amira 's board and own a small equity stake in the company . </s>
<s> The Amira transaction is typical of the way venture-capital firms are approaching the task of commercializing biotechnology research . </s>
<s> While universities develop the basic research , `` venture capitalists are the ones best positioned to finance its commercialization , '' says Gloria W. Doubleday of Commonwealth . </s>
<s> `` This is the best way to transfer technology straight off the campuses of universities . '' </s>
<s> But the new guidelines could prevent scientists like Prof. Schimmel from being involved with start-ups such as Amira , venture capitalists point out . </s>
<s> And if that happens , the entire process of transferring technology to the marketplace could be harmed , they say . </s>
<s> The stakes in the controversy are large . </s>
<s> Last year , venture capitalists spent an estimated $ 600 million to finance start-up companies in medical and biotechnology businesses , according to the National Venture Capital Association , a trade group . </s>
<s> Many of the deals involved transactions in which scientific institutions or researchers agreed to commercialize their work in return for an equity stake or royalties . </s>
<s> In many of these deals , `` venture capitalists had the inside track , '' says Lawrence Bock of Avalon Ventures , La Jolla , Calif . </s>
<s> Investors were willing to gamble on new technologies because `` we had exclusive rights to those technologies , '' he adds . </s>
<s> But under the proposed guidelines , all federally funded research will have to be reported publicly so that anyone can capitalize on the work . </s>
<s> `` Without the exclusivity , most venture capitalists wo n't have the incentive to invest in such deals , '' Mr. Bock says . </s>
<s> Last year , for example , Avalon and others invested $ 14 million in Athena Neurosciences Inc. , South San Francisco , Calif. , to license and develop technology for delivery of drugs to the brain . </s>
<s> But before Athena was able to get an exclusive license to the technology , the Federal Register published most of the details , `` giving all of the company 's potential competitors a chance to exploit it , '' Mr. Bock says . </s>
<s> Athena eventually acquired exclusive rights to the technology and currently is developing it . </s>
<s> But , says Mr. Bock , `` It was a close call . '' </s>
<s> The proposed guidelines could also delay commercialization -- and force small companies to waste scarce capital , entrepreneurs say . </s>
<s> If start-ups ca n't have early access to research being conducted at institutions , `` we have to replicate it ourselves or do without the research , '' says Ruth Emyanitoff , manager of business development at Applied bioTechnology Inc. , a Cambridge , Mass. , concern . </s>
<s> Duplicating research is both costly and time-consuming for a start-up , Ms. Emyanitoff says . </s>
<s> For its part , NIH insists that its guidelines `` should not stifle research creativity or technology transfer from the research laboratory to commercial use . '' </s>
<s> Universities such as Harvard and MIT should be able to develop a way to act as brokers for the individual scientists , says Katherine Bick , who oversees the huge NIH grants program as its deputy director for extramural research . </s>
<s> NIH staff members believe the guidelines are essential to prevent the escalation of problems that have already begun to surface in scientific ventures . </s>
<s> Not long ago , scientists holding stock in Spectra Pharmaceutical Services Inc. were accused of falsifying research to boost the stock . </s>
<s> Many officials are also concerned about companies getting a `` free ride '' on government-sponsored research . </s>
<s> A congressional subcommitee has been investigating the potential abuse from researchers holding stock in companies exploiting their research . </s>
<s> Among other provisions , the NIH guidelines would prohibit researchers and members of their immediate families from holding stock in any company that is affected by the outcome of their research . </s>
<s> Ms. Bick , the NIH administrator , says the business and scientific community is overreacting to what the agency merely meant to be `` ideas for discussion . '' </s>
<s> The predictions of doom are `` premature , '' she says . </s>
<s> But when agencies like the NIH circulate guidelines , they 've often already formulated policy , veteran scientists say . </s>
<s> Indeed , institutions already are taking note . </s>
<s> On Sept. 14 , Harvard began circulating a conflict-of-interest policy statement that , in effect , would follow the NIH guidelines faithfully . </s>
<s> The University of California at San Francisco is also circulating a memo among its scientific faculty that will restrict contact with the world of business . </s>
<s> In many other institutions , scientists are shunning contacts with venture investors until the NIH policy is settled . </s>
<s> Says Mr. Daly , the venture capitalist : `` It does n't matter whether they call it guidelines or policy . </s>
<s> The damage is already done . </s>
