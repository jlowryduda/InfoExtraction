<s> Lomas , assisted by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets , has been trying to sell its Equitable Lomas Leasing Co. for several months , apparently without success . </s>
<s> The real estate and mortgage banking concern had hoped to use proceeds from the sale to reduce its debt . </s>
<s> Without cash from asset sales and unable to reach a new bank-credit agreement , Lomas defaulted on $ 145 million in notes that became due Sept. 1 . </s>
<s> It filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code Sept. 24 to give it additional time to work on a plan to restructure its $ 1.45 billion in senior debt . </s>
<s> Lomas said Merrill Lynch , which owns bonds and equity in Lomas , could n't continue as Lomas 's investment banker because it is also a creditor . </s>
<s> It said it chose Lazard in part because of Lazard 's offices in Europe and Japan , where investors might be interested in a U.S. leasing company . </s>
