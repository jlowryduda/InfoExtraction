<s> Put down that phone . </s>
<s> Walk around the room ; take two deep breaths . </s>
<s> Resist the urge to call your broker and sell all your stocks . </s>
<s> That 's the advice of most investment professionals after Friday 's 190-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average . </s>
<s> No one can say for sure what will happen today . </s>
<s> And investment pros are divided on whether stocks will perform well or badly in the next six months . </s>
<s> But they 're nearly unanimous on one point : Do n't sell into a panic . </s>
<s> Investors who sold everything after the crash of 1987 lived to regret it . </s>
<s> Even after Friday 's plunge , the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 48 % above where it landed on Oct. 19 two years ago . </s>
<s> Panic selling also was unwise during other big declines in the past . </s>
<s> The crash of 1929 was followed by a substantial recovery before the great Depression and awful bear market of the 1930s began . </s>
<s> The `` October massacres '' of 1978 and 1979 were scary , but did n't lead to severe or sustained downturns . </s>
<s> Indeed , some pros see Friday 's plunge , plus any further damage that might occur early this week , as a chance for bargain hunting . </s>
<s> `` There has been a lot of emotional selling that presents a nice buying opportunity if you 've got the cash , '' says Stephen B. Timbers , chief investment officer of Chicago-based Kemper Financial Services Inc . </s>
<s> But most advisers think the immediate course for individual investors should be to stand pat . </s>
<s> `` When you see a runaway train , '' says Steve Janachowski , partner in the San Francisco investment advisory firm Brouwer & Janachowski , `` you wait for the train to stop . '' </s>
<s> Even for people who expect a bear market in coming months -- and a sizable number of money managers and market pundits do -- the advice is : Wait for the market to bounce back , and sell shares gradually during rallies . </s>
<s> The best thing individual investors can do is `` just sit tight , '' says Marshall B. Front , executive vice president and head of investment counseling at Stein Roe & Farnham Inc. , a Chicago-based investment counseling firm that manages about $ 18 billion . </s>
<s> On the one hand , Mr. Front says , it would be misguided to sell into `` a classic panic . '' </s>
<s> On the other hand , it 's not necessarily a good time to jump in and buy . </s>
<s> `` This is all emotion right now , and when emotion starts to run , it can run further than anyone anticipates , '' he said . </s>
<s> `` So it 's more prudent to wait and see how things stabilize . '' </s>
<s> Roger Ibbotson , professor of finance at Yale University and head of the market information firm Ibbotson Associates Inc. , says , `` My real advice would be to just ride through it . </s>
<s> Generally , it is n't wise to be in and out '' of the stock market . </s>
<s> Mr. Ibbotson thinks that this week is `` going to be a roller-coaster week . '' </s>
<s> But he also thinks it is `` a good week to consider buying . '' </s>
<s> John Snyder , former president of the Los Angeles chapter of the National Association of Investors Corp. , an organization of investment clubs and individual investors , says his fellow club members did n't sell in the crash of 1987 , and see no reason to sell now . </s>
<s> `` We 're dedicated long-term investors , not traders , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` We understand panics and euphoria . </s>
<s> And we hope to take advantage of panics and buy stocks when they plunge . '' </s>
<s> One camp of investment pros sees what happened Friday as an opportunity . </s>
<s> Over the next days and weeks , they say , investors should look for stocks to buy . </s>
<s> Friday 's action `` was an old-fashioned panic , '' says Alfred Goldman , director of technical market analysis for A.G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis . </s>
<s> `` Stocks were being thrown out of windows at any price . '' </s>
<s> His advice : `` You ought to be there with a basket catching them . '' </s>
<s> James Craig , portfolio manager for the Denver-based Janus Fund , which has one of the industry 's better track records , started his buying during Friday 's plunge . </s>
<s> Stocks such as Hershey Foods Corp. , Wal-Mart Stores Inc. , American International Group Inc. and Federal National Mortgage Association became such bargains that he could n't resist them , he says . </s>
<s> And Mr. Craig expects to pick up more shares today . </s>
<s> `` It will be chaotic at first , but I would not be buying if I thought we were headed for real trouble , '' he says . </s>
<s> He argues that stocks are reasonably valued now , and that interest rates are lower now than in the fall of 1987 . </s>
<s> Mr. Front of Stein Roe suggests that any buying should `` concentrate in stocks that have lagged the market on the up side , or stocks that have been beaten down a lot more than the market in this correction . '' </s>
<s> His firm favors selected computer , drug and pollution-control stocks . </s>
<s> Other investment pros are more pessimistic . </s>
<s> They say investors should sell stocks -- but not necessarily right away . </s>
<s> Many of them stress that the selling can be orderly , gradual , and done when stock prices are rallying . </s>
<s> On Thursday , William Fleckenstein , a Seattle money manager , used futures contracts in his personal account to place a bet that the broad market averages would decline . </s>
<s> He thinks the underlying inflation rate is around 5 % to 6 % , far higher than most people suppose . </s>
<s> In the pension accounts he manages , Mr. Fleckenstein has raised cash positions and invested in gold and natural gas stocks , partly as an inflation hedge . </s>
<s> He thinks government officials are terrified to let a recession start when government , corporate and personal debt levels are so high . </s>
<s> So he thinks the government will err on the side of rekindled inflation . </s>
<s> As a result , Mr. Fleckenstein says , `` I think the ball game 's over , '' and investors are about to face a bear market . </s>
<s> David M. Jones , vice president at Aubrey G. Lanston & Co. , recommends Treasury securities -LRB- of up to five years ' maturity -RRB- . </s>
<s> He says the Oct. 6 employment report , showing slower economic growth and a severe weakening in the manufacturing sector , is a warning sign to investors . </s>
<s> One strategy for investors who want to stay in but hedge their bets is to buy `` put '' options , either on the individual stocks they own or on a broad market index . </s>
<s> A put option gives its holder the right -LRB- but not the obligation -RRB- to sell a stock -LRB- or stock index -RRB- for a specified price -LRB- the strike price -RRB- until the option expires . </s>
<s> Whether this insurance is worthwhile depends on the cost of an option . </s>
<s> The cost , or premium , tends to get fat in times of crisis . </s>
<s> Thus , buying puts after a big market slide can be an expensive way to hedge against risk . </s>
<s> The prices of puts generally did n't soar Friday . </s>
<s> For example , the premium as a percentage of the stock price for certain puts on Eli Lilly & Co. moved up from 3 % at Thursday 's close to only 3.3 % at Friday 's close , even though the shares dropped more than $ 5.50 . </s>
<s> But put-option prices may zoom when trading resumes today . </s>
<s> It 's hard to generalize about a reasonable price for puts . </s>
<s> But investors should keep in mind , before paying too much , that the average annual return for stock holdings , long-term , is 9 % to 10 % a year ; a return of 15 % is considered praiseworthy . </s>
<s> Paying , say , 10 % for insurance against losses takes a deep bite out of the return . </s>
