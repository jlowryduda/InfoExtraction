<s> Georgia-Pacific Corp. offered to acquire Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. for $ 58 a share , or about $ 3.18 billion . </s>
<s> The offer capped a week of rumors that Georgia-Pacific , an Atlanta-based forest-products company , was considering making a bid for Nekoosa , a paper-products concern based in Norwalk , Conn . </s>
<s> Executives at Nekoosa could n't be reached , and officials at Georgia Pacific declined to comment . </s>
<s> Analysts , however , were surprised because the tender offer appeared unsolicited . </s>
<s> `` It 's quite a bombshell , '' said one , adding that the offer could spark a period of industry consolidation . </s>
<s> The two companies would appear to be a logical fit because of their complementary lines , and analysts described the offer , representing a 36 % premium over Nekoosa 's market price , as fair . </s>
<s> Nekoosa closed yesterday at $ 42.75 , up $ 2.75 , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading . </s>
<s> But industry observers still questioned whether Georgia Pacific will ultimately prevail . </s>
<s> `` You have to watch out for counterbids , '' said one analyst . `` </s>
<s> International Paper or Weyerhaeuser could step in . '' </s>
<s> The bid for Great Northern , a notice of which appears in an advertisement in today 's Wall Street Journal , is the first big takeover offer since the collapse of a $ 6.79 billion buy-out of United Airlines parent UAL Corp. Oct. 13 . </s>
<s> That collapse , following on the heels of disarray in the market for high-risk , high-yield bonds , cast doubt on the entire takeover business , which has fueled both big profits among Wall Street securities firms and big gains in the stock market generally . </s>
<s> While Georgia-Pacific 's stock has outperformed the market in the past two years , Nekoosa has lagged the market in the same period . </s>
<s> Yesterday 's rise in Nekoosa 's share price came on volume of 786,700 shares , four times the daily average . </s>
<s> According to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report , options trading in Nekoosa was also heavy , ranking only behind International Business Machines Corp. and UAL in volume on the Chicago Board Options Exchange . </s>
<s> According to the Value Line Investment Survey , demand for Nekoosa 's commodity paper has weakened , prompting earnings to decline by 6.6 % in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 . </s>
<s> Value Line added , `` With discounts widening on business papers , and with newsprint and corrugated shipments flat , we expect negative earnings comparisons through next year . '' </s>
<s> By contrast , Value Line said Georgia-Pacific `` is in a comparatively good position to deal with weakening paper markets , '' because its production is concentrated not in the Northwest but in the South , where it should be able to avoid some of the cost pressures from rising wood-chip prices . </s>
<s> Also , it is n't exposed to the weakening newsprint business , and is strong in the less-cyclical tissue business . </s>
<s> The purchase of Nekoosa would easily eclipse Georgia-Pacific 's $ 530 million acquisition of Brunswick Pulp & Paper Co. last year . </s>
<s> That acquisition , which also included the assumption of $ 135 million in debt , was designed to allow Georgia-Pacific to capitalize on the strong demand for softwood pulp , as well as reduce its exposure to the housing market . </s>
<s> Wasserstein Perella & Co. is the dealer-manager for the offer , which will expire Nov. 29 , unless extended . </s>
