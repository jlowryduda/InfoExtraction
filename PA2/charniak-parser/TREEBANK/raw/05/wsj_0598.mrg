<s> Federal Reserve critics used to complain of `` stop and go '' monetary policies . </s>
<s> They claimed that the Fed would first give a green light to the economy by making credit readily available and then turn on the red and bring growth to a screeching halt . </s>
<s> But under Alan Greenspan that has changed . </s>
<s> A supremely cautious man , the Fed chairman is forever blinking yellow . </s>
<s> Indeed , his caution has become legendary within the government . </s>
<s> He fusses endlessly over economic statistics , dissecting them in dozens of ways , probing for hours in search of potential problems . </s>
<s> After thoroughly digesting reams of information , he often concludes that more data are needed , and when he finally decides to act , his movements sometimes seem excrutiatingly small . </s>
<s> Such caution was evident after the recent Friday-the-13th stock market plunge . </s>
<s> Some Bush administration officials urged Mr. Greenspan to make an immediate public announcement of his plans to provide ample credit to the markets . </s>
<s> But he refused , claiming that he wanted to see what happened Monday morning before making any public statement . </s>
<s> Mr. Greenspan 's decision to keep quiet also prompted a near-mutiny within the Fed 's ranks . </s>
<s> A `` senior Fed official '' spoke on Saturday after the market swoon to both the Washington Post and the New York Times , saying the Fed was prepared to provide as much credit as the markets needed . </s>
<s> The statement angered Chairman Greenspan , but it was greeted with applause by the Bush administration and the financial markets . </s>
<s> And , while the mutinous Fed member has n't gone public , some Fed governors , most notably Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson , are known to have disagreed with the chairman 's decision to remain silent . </s>
<s> Ironically , the anonymous official 's comments have earned some plaudits for Mr. Greenspan , who is mistakenly seen as the source . </s>
<s> At a hearing last week , Democratic Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut told Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady that `` Chairman Greenspan 's '' announcement over the Oct. 13 weekend was a `` very important statement . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Brady hesitantly replied that he was n't sure whether Mr. Greenspan `` made a statement himself , or whether that was a newspaper report . '' </s>
<s> The Fed chairman 's caution was apparent again on the Monday morning after the market 's plunge , when the central bank took only modest steps to aid the markets . </s>
<s> A surprisingly small amount of reserves was added to the banking system . </s>
<s> And , by the end of that week , the key federal funds interest rate , which is largely controlled by the Fed , had settled at 8.75 % , barely changed from the level of just under 9 % that prevailed the previous week . </s>
<s> Bush administration officials appear increasingly concerned that Mr. Greenspan is cautious to a fault . </s>
<s> Signs of growing weakness in the economy , paired with indications that inflation is staying well under control , have caused them to wonder why the Fed chairman is so grudging in reducing rates . </s>
<s> Those concerns are n't expressed in public . </s>
<s> In fact , the administration and the Fed have been going out of their way in the past two weeks to dispel any impression that they are at odds , fearing stories about an administration-Fed split added to the stock market 's jitters . </s>
<s> Still , the split is there . </s>
<s> The administration 's concerns are understandable . </s>
<s> The economy is showing signs of weakness , particularly among manufacturers . </s>
<s> Exports , which played a key role in fueling growth over the last two years , seem to have stalled . </s>
<s> Factory payrolls and production fell in September , and the auto industry and housing are in a severe crunch . </s>
<s> But Mr. Greenspan remains reluctant to loosen policy , partly because he faces a phalanx of presidents of regional Fed banks who oppose credit easing . </s>
<s> In addition , the chairman has a wary eye aimed a year or two down the road . </s>
<s> Inflation may be stable at the moment , running at about 4.5 % . </s>
<s> But if the Fed eases too soon , Mr. Greenspan fears , prices may begin to accelerate again next year . </s>
<s> Moreover , if the Fed holds tight , it may be able gradually to reduce inflation , moving toward the zero-inflation goal that the Fed chairman embraced in testimony to Congress last week . </s>
<s> So far , Mr. Greenspan 's cautious approach to policy has served both him and the nation well . </s>
<s> His hand on the monetary tiller seems one reason why the economy next month seems highly likely to begin an unprecedented eighth year of peacetime growth without a recession . </s>
<s> `` We 've gotten through two stock market crashes , and we 've gone through an election without any major problems , '' says David Hale , an economist of Kemper Financial Services . </s>
<s> `` I think you have to give Greenspan a good rating . '' </s>
<s> But such caution is no guarantee against mistakes . </s>
<s> The Fed 's reluctance to ease credit now could be laying the groundwork for a new recession , perhaps starting early next year . </s>
<s> If that happens , Chairman Greenspan could well become an open target . </s>
<s> Already , Congress is toying with legislation to curb the Fed 's independence . </s>
<s> If the economy turns down , such proposals could gain strong momentum . </s>
