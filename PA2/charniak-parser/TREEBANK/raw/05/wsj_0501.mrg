<s> Japanese companies have long been accused of sacrificing profit to boost sales . </s>
<s> But Fujitsu Ltd. has taken that practice to a new extreme . </s>
<s> Japan 's biggest computer maker last week undercut seven competitors to win a contract to design a mapping system for the city of Hiroshima 's waterworks . </s>
<s> Its bid : one yen , or less than a U.S. penny . </s>
<s> The bid created such a furor that Fujitsu said it is now offering to withdraw from the project . </s>
<s> `` From a common-sense viewpoint , it was not socially acceptable , '' a Fujitsu spokeswoman said yesterday . </s>
<s> Hiroshima city officials could n't be reached to find out whether they would drop Fujitsu 's bid . </s>
<s> Fujitsu said it issued the low bid because it wanted a foot in the door of a potentially lucrative market . </s>
<s> `` We desperately wanted the contract because we want experience in the field , '' the Fujitsu spokeswoman said . </s>
<s> `` We expect a big market in the future , so in the long term it will be profitable . </s>
<s> It 's a kind of an investment . '' </s>
<s> Hiroshima 's waterworks bureau said the municipal government had budgeted about 11 million yen -LRB- $ 77,500 -RRB- for the project . </s>
<s> `` I was flabbergasted , '' Tatsuhara Yamane , head of the bureau , was quoted by Kyodo news service as saying . </s>
<s> `` I understand the firm 's enthusiasm in getting the deal , but such a large company would have been better off showing a little more discretion . '' </s>
<s> Indeed , Fujitsu officials admitted they may have been a little overzealous . </s>
<s> The Fujitsu spokeswoman said headquarter officials did n't approve the bid in advance and will take measures so this kind of thing does n't happen in the future . </s>
<s> `` It 's contrary to common sense , '' she added . </s>
<s> Specifically , Fujitsu won the right to design the specifications for a computerized system that will show water lines throughout the city . </s>
<s> The system could be used in a fire or earthquake to locate problems , among other things . </s>
<s> A waterworks official said Fujitsu will have to design the system so it would be compatible with other makers ' equipment . </s>
<s> But industry officials expressed concern that the initial project might give Fujitsu an edge in winning more lucrative contracts later . </s>
<s> Fujitsu said it hopes the Hiroshima contract will help it secure pacts with other municipalities . </s>
<s> Japanese local governments are expected to invest heavily in computer systems over the next few years , and many companies expect that field to provide substantial revenue . </s>
<s> `` In the near future , it will be a big market , not just for waterworks , but for all mapping systems , '' the Fujitsu spokeswoman said . </s>
<s> `` We can expect a hundreds-of-billions-of-yen market . '' </s>
<s> No foreign companies bid on the Hiroshima project , according to the bureau . </s>
<s> But the Japanese practice of deep discounting often is cited by Americans as a classic barrier to entry in Japan 's market . </s>
<s> Earlier this year , the U.S. complained that Japan 's supercomputer makers were effectively closing out foreign competitors by slashing prices as much as 90 % for universities . </s>
<s> Fujitsu was n't the only company willing to sacrifice profit on the project . </s>
<s> Three competitors bid between 300,000 yen and 500,000 yen , according to the Hiroshima government office . </s>
<s> Other bids ranged from about 10 million yen to 29 million yen . </s>
