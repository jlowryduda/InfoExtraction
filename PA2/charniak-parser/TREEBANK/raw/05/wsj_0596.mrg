<s> October was an edgy month for the practitioners of glasnost , the official Soviet policy of allowing more candor from the nation 's media . </s>
<s> For one of the superstars of glasnost , Vitaly Korotich , editor of the trail-blazing weekly Ogonyok , Friday , Oct. 20 was a somersaulting day that turned from tension to elation . </s>
<s> He had been summoned to the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party , after he finished his lunch at the Savoy Hotel , an unlikely prelude to a bureaucratic brow-beating : Eight-foot-tall Rubenesquely naked ladies float on their canvases toward a ceiling teeming with cherubs , all surrounded by gilt laid on with a pastry chef 's trowel and supported by marble corinthian columns whose capitals are fluting fountains of gold . </s>
<s> Why had Mr. Korotich been called ? </s>
<s> `` I told my driver , '' he said , `` that he was taking my butt to the Central Committee so they can ... '' whack , whack , whack his hand made vigorous spanking gestures on his left palm . `` </s>
<s> They feel the need from time to time to ` educate ' me . '' </s>
<s> And indeed , as he later reported , that was the import of the meeting . </s>
<s> Anxious allies of President Mikhail Gorbachev are cautioning media leaders to take it easy , to be careful not to do anything that could be used by Mr. Gorbachev 's opponents . </s>
<s> The government is nervous . </s>
<s> According to Mr. Korotich , who was present , Mr. Gorbachev 's publicized tongue-lashing of the press on Oct. 13 was more of a plea : `` Be careful boys ; use good judgment . </s>
<s> We 're standing in gasoline , so do n't smoke ! '' </s>
<s> U.S. and northern European diplomats confirm Mr. Korotich 's assessment that glasnost is in no immediate danger . </s>
<s> In fact , a very high-ranking Soviet official told an American official at a diplomatic dinner that no change in the policy was contemplated . </s>
<s> The day after that conversation at the residence of the U.S. ambassador , the Brezhnevite editor of Pravda , Victor Afnasjev , was replaced by a college classmate of Mr. Gorbachev 's . </s>
<s> Brezhnevite holdovers have more to fear from Mr. Gorbachev than the verbal spanking he gave to the press . </s>
<s> At the end of the very week in which Mr. Korotich was called to the Central Committee , Ogonyok was again demonstrating its independence by printing a poll that showed that 35 % of the Soviet population , a plurality , believed that Mr. Gorbachev 's economic reforms , perestroika , would result in only insignificant change . </s>
<s> A good measurement of the popularity of ice-breaker journals like Ogonyok is circulation . </s>
<s> When Mr. Korotich took it over in 1986 , it sold 250,000 copies ; today it sells 3.4 million . </s>
<s> Pravda , meanwhile , has retained only 57 % of its 1986 readership . </s>
<s> Glasnost has made celebrities of men like Mr. Korotich . </s>
<s> Prevented by the Communist Party from getting on its slate of nominees for the new Supreme Soviet , he stood as an independent candidate for Congress from his native Ukraine and won with 84 % of the vote . </s>
<s> The same evening that he was summoned for a warning from the Party , he was cheered by thousands of his supporters at a rally of what can only be called the Korotich party . </s>
<s> But as astounding as the changes that have already occurred are , there is a fragility to glasnost . </s>
<s> Censorship is n't a Marxist invention . </s>
<s> The czars were no civil libertarians . </s>
<s> As late as the 1890s , the Russian government prevented any coverage of famines . </s>
<s> It even directed newspapers not to publish anything that might stain the honor of the Turkish sultan 's wives . </s>
<s> So glasnost is not a value woven with steel threads into the fabric of Russian society . </s>
<s> It is an admirable public relations program initiated by a single political leader during a four-year blink of history . </s>
<s> It is public relations of the highest sophistication , that recognizes that credibility is enhanced by honesty -- up to a point . </s>
<s> What is that point ? </s>
<s> Will Ogonyok begin a series of reports analyzing the failures of perestroika ? </s>
<s> `` I 'd be destroying myself , '' replies Mr. Korotich , who then asks , `` What would that accomplish ? </s>
<s> '' His answer reveals his vulnerability -- it also draws the line that Soviet society must cross to enter the normal dialogue of Western culture . </s>
<s> It is the line beyond which the press can report not only on the bankruptcy of factories but on the failures of even admirable leaders . </s>
