<s> Despite politicians ' hand-wringing about the federal budget , the government ended fiscal 1989 with a $ 152.08 billion deficit , about the same as the two previous years . </s>
<s> Even White House budget director Richard Darman had trouble finding a silver lining in the report . </s>
<s> `` I suppose you could say the good news is that the deficits are not heading up , '' he said , `` but you ca n't be satisfied with deficits at this level and we 're not . '' </s>
<s> The federal deficit was $ 155.15 billion in 1988 and $ 149.69 billion in 1987 . </s>
<s> The 1989 deficit would have been nearly $ 10 billion larger had the government been able to spend as much as Congress intended on cleaning up the thrift industry before the year ended on Sept. 30 . </s>
<s> Because the Resolution Trust Corp . could n't spend the money fast enough , the savings-and-loan outlays were pushed into fiscal 1990 . </s>
<s> Nevertheless , the 1989 deficit still exceeded the $ 136 billion target set by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law by $ 16 billion , a reminder of that law 's shortcomings . </s>
<s> The law sets a deficit target of $ 100 billion for fiscal 1990 . </s>
<s> A partisan fight over cutting capital-gains taxes has slowed the progress of 1990 deficit-reduction legislation almost to a halt , triggering across-the-board spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law . </s>
<s> The White House and the Democratic leadership in Congress blame each other for turning capital-gains taxes into such a divisive issue this year . </s>
<s> Neither side showed any sign of retreating . </s>
<s> Meeting with reporters Friday , Mr. Darman again said he would rather live with across-the-board spending cuts than accept a deficit-reduction bill like the one passed by the House , which would increase spending in future years . </s>
<s> Underscoring the size of the deficits of the past few years , the Treasury report showed that for the first time interest paid on the public debt -- $ 240.86 billion -- exceeded spending on Social Security , the single largest government program . </s>

<s> The government ran a deficit of $ 6.16 billion in September , compared with a surplus of $ 10.17 billion in September 1988 . </s>
<s> Outlays for the month totaled $ 105.39 billion , up from $ 87.57 billion a year earlier . </s>
