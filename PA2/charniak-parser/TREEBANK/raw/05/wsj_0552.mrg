<s> When the economy stumbled in the mid-1970s , Akzo NV fell out of bed . </s>
<s> Towering overcapacity in the synthetic fiber business , which accounted for half of the Dutch chemical company 's sales , led to huge losses and left Akzo 's survival in doubt . </s>
<s> It was n't until the early 1980s that Akzo nursed itself back to health . </s>
<s> Now , as a new downturn in the chemical industry looms , Akzo says it is in far better shape to cope . </s>
<s> Investment analysts generally agree . </s>
<s> Aside from slashing costs and investing heavily in its plants , Akzo has spent 3.9 billion guilders -LRB- $ 1.88 billion -RRB- on acquisitions since 1983 to give it better balance . </s>
<s> During the same period , the company has sold about 1.6 billion guilders of assets . </s>
<s> The fibers business , whose products go into textiles , carpeting and myriad industrial uses , now accounts for only 20 % of Akzo 's sales . </s>
<s> `` We have definitely become less cyclical , '' Syb Bergsma , executive vice president-finance , said in an interview . </s>
<s> Still , Akzo has n't yet found a way to achieve another goal : a large presence in the U.S. market for prescription drugs . </s>
<s> Mr. Bergsma said prices for U.S. pharmaceutical companies remain too high , making it unlikely that Akzo will pursue any major acquisitions in that area . </s>
<s> But he said Akzo is considering `` alliances '' with American drug companies , although he would n't elaborate . </s>
<s> An indication of Akzo 's success in reshaping itself will come Thursday when it reports third-quarter results . </s>
<s> Analysts expect the company to show profit of about 225 million guilders , up 9 % from 206.3 million guilders a year earlier . </s>
<s> A bigger test will come next year if , as many analysts expect , bulk chemical prices slump in Europe . </s>
<s> `` Maybe Akzo can surprise the investment world a bit , '' said Jaap Visker , an analyst at Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV . </s>
<s> He figures Akzo is likely to be one of the few major chemical companies to show profit growth next year . </s>
<s> The bank projects Akzo will show per-share earnings of 24 guilders in 1990 , up from an estimated 22.5 guilders for this year and the 20.9 guilders reported for 1988 . </s>
<s> At James Capel & Co. in London , analyst Jackie Ashurst notes that Akzo is less exposed than many of its rivals to the most volatile chemical products . </s>
<s> For example , Akzo has only minor petrochemical operations , is small in plastics and does n't make fertilizers . </s>
<s> Thus , while Akzo profited less than many rivals from the boom of recent years in petrochemicals and plastics , it has less to fear from the current slump . </s>
<s> The company is exposed to bulk chemicals , however . </s>
<s> Although bulk-chemical prices have begun falling in the U.S. , they are generally stable in Europe , Mr. Bergsma said . </s>
<s> A decline may come in the first half of 1990 , he said , but the market does n't appear on the verge of a severe downturn . </s>
<s> To reduce the danger of such pricing cycles , Akzo has invested heavily in specialty chemicals , which have highly specific industrial uses and tend to produce much higher profit margins than do bulk chemicals . </s>
<s> Akzo 's biggest move in this area was the 1987 acquisition of Stauffer Chemical Co. 's specialty chemical business for $ 625 million . </s>
<s> In a less glamorous field , Akzo is the world 's biggest producer of industrial salt , used as a raw material for the chemical industry as well as for such tasks as melting ice . </s>
<s> Akzo also makes products derived from salt , such as chlorine and caustic soda . </s>
<s> In the fibers division , profit remains weak , largely because of persistent overcapacity . </s>
<s> But Akzo is still slimming down : It recently announced plans to eliminate about 1,700 fiber-related jobs in the Netherlands and West Germany . </s>
<s> Although the polyester and rayon markets remain mostly bleak , Akzo has high hopes for some emerging fiber businesses , such carbon fibers and aramid , extremely strong fibers used to reinforce tires and metals and to make such products as bullet-proof vests . </s>
<s> Akzo 's Twaron aramid fiber is a distant second to Du Pont Co. 's Kevlar , which dominates the market . </s>
<s> Mr. Bergsma said world-wide industry sales of aramid fibers are expected to total about $ 500 million this year . </s>
<s> Sales growth of 10 % a year seems possible , he said , and Akzo expects its Twaron business to become profitable in 1990 . </s>
<s> Akzo also has spent heavily on acquisitions in paints , auto finishes and industrial coatings . </s>
<s> In August , for example , it completed the $ 110 million acquisition of Reliance Universal Inc. , a U.S. maker of industrial coatings for wood , metals and plastics , from Tyler Corp . </s>
<s> Mr. Bergsma said Akzo is likely to see strong profit growth from coatings as it realizes cost savings and other benefits from its greater scale . </s>
<s> For Akzo 's drug business , where profits have shown litle change for the past five years , Mr. Bergsma predicted moderate profit growth . </s>
<s> Akzo is the leading seller of birth-control pills in Europe but is still seeking regulatory approvals to enter that market in the U.S. and Japan . </s>
<s> Mr. Bergsma said Akzo hopes to have approval to sell its Marvelon pill in the U.S. in 1992 . </s>
<s> Akzo also has small operations in diagnostic tests , generic drugs and veterinary products . </s>
<s> Veterinary products are showing especially strong growth , Mr. Bergsma said . </s>
<s> Among the leading products is a flu shot for horses . </s>
