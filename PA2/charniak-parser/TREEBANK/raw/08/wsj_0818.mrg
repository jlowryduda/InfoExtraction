<s> The Big Three U.S. auto makers posted losses in their core North American automotive businesses for the third quarter , and expectations of continued slow vehicle sales and price wars are casting a pall over the fourth period . </s>
<s> The strongest sign of the Big Three 's woes came from Ford Motor Co. , which said it had a loss in its U.S. automotive business for the first time since 1982 . </s>
<s> Ford predicted fourth-quarter net income will fall below the year-earlier level , partly because of a likely $ 500 million charge from the sale of its steel operations . </s>
<s> The bleak automotive results were offset by strong earnings from some non-automotive operations . </s>
<s> Still , the combined profit of Ford , Chrysler Corp. and General Motors Corp. fell 44 % to $ 1.02 billion from $ 1.83 billion a year earlier , excluding a one-time gain of $ 309 million at Chrysler from the sale of Mitsubishi Motors Corp. stock . </s>
<s> The last time all three companies reported North American automotive losses was in the recession year of 1982 . </s>
<s> Yesterday 's announcements helped spark a midday wave of program selling in the stock market . </s>
<s> GM 's common closed at $ 44.375 a share , down 50 cents , Ford fell 37.5 cents to end at $ 47.50 , and Chrysler eased 37.5 cents to $ 22.25 , all in New York Stock Exchange composite trading . </s>
<s> The market 's pessimism reflects the gloomy outlook in Detroit . </s>
<s> As Japanese auto makers gained market share , the Big Three , with GM in the lead , slashed North American production and launched a retail discounting blitz . </s>
<s> The price war peaked in the third quarter as Big Three factory discounts climbed to more than $ 1,000 a vehicle , according to industry officials . </s>
<s> GM probably had the `` heaviest incentives , '' said Robert S. Miller , Chrysler 's chief financial officer . </s>
<s> `` We all did what we had to do to stay within sight of them . '' </s>
<s> But the costly efforts did little to slow Japanese market gains , and domestic car sales have plunged 19 % since the Big Three ended many of their programs Sept. 30 . </s>
<s> GM , Ford and Chrysler have already cut fourth-quarter U.S. output plans an estimated 15 % from 1988 levels . </s>
<s> If sales do n't pick up , the cuts will go deeper and incentives will sprout again . </s>
<s> Ford , which has long boasted of its ability to weather a downturn , saw earnings take a beating . </s>
<s> The No. 2 auto maker blamed incentive costs and reduced production -- both the result of a substantially weaker U.S. market -- for a 44 % drop in net to $ 477.1 million , or $ 1.03 a share , on revenue of $ 20.24 billion . </s>
<s> Nearly all the decline came in Ford 's U.S. automotive operations . </s>
<s> The Dearborn , Mich. , auto maker ran a loss of $ 37 million on assembling and marketing cars in the U.S. , a deterioration of $ 378 million in that line from the 1988 quarter . </s>
<s> Ford managed to show a profit for the quarter primarily because of earnings from overseas auto operations and financial services . </s>
<s> A year earlier , Ford reported record net of $ 856.3 million , or $ 1.78 a share , on revenue of $ 20.38 billion . </s>
<s> In the latest nine months , Ford earned $ 3.52 billion , or $ 7.51 a share , compared with $ 4.14 billion , or $ 8.53 a share . </s>
<s> The U.S. automotive loss was a sharp reversal for a company that had reeled off 12 consecutive quarters of improved earnings until the 1989 second quarter . </s>
<s> But David N. McCammon , vice president , finance , insisted that cost-cutting and tight production capacity will make results `` better in this downturn than in prior downturns , '' when Ford had net losses . </s>
<s> Still , Mr. McCammon said Ford expects the U.S. economy to weaken through the end of 1990 , causing weaker sales and production . </s>
<s> As a result , fourth-quarter profit will come in below 1988 results , although the drop wo n't be as sharp as the 44 % third-quarter decline , he said . </s>
<s> Part of the drop will come from an anticipated charge of as much as $ 500 million from the proposed sale of its Rouge Steel unit . </s>
<s> In the 1988 fourth quarter , Ford had net of $ 1.16 billion , or $ 2.42 a share . </s>
<s> Chrysler 's operating profit fell to a scant $ 22 million , or 10 cents a share , its lowest quarterly total in seven years . </s>
<s> Its $ 309 million , or $ 1.32 a share , gain from the sale of 75 million Mitsubishi shares made net $ 331 million , or $ 1.42 a share . </s>
<s> Sales were flat at $ 7.88 billion . </s>
<s> The results include record quarterly earnings of $ 76 million from Chrysler Financial Corp . </s>
<s> A year earlier , Chrysler 's net was $ 113 million , or 50 cents a share . </s>
<s> Mr. Miller said costs of incentives caused a `` moderate '' loss in the Highland Park , Mich. , company 's North American car and truck business . </s>
<s> He said the loss was n't `` that much different '' from Ford 's $ 37 million loss on U.S. automotive operations , but he declined to be specific . </s>
<s> Mr. Miller said Chrysler spent an average of $ 1,000 a vehicle on its incentive programs in the third quarter , compared with about $ 450 a vehicle a year earlier -- a `` high-water mark '' at the time . </s>
<s> He said Chrysler `` is no longer sure '' of its forecast for industry car and truck sales of 14.2 million in the 1990 model year . </s>
<s> Consumers , he said , are balking at higher prices on 1990 cars , especially after seeing the incentive-reduced prices on 1989 models . </s>
<s> In the nine months , net was $ 1.02 billion , or $ 4.38 a share , including the gain from the Mitsubishi stock sale , compared with $ 617 million , or $ 2.77 a share , after a charge of $ 93 million , or 42 cents a share , for plant closings in the 1988 period . </s>
<s> Sales rose 8.4 % to $ 27.95 billion from $ 25.78 billion . </s>
<s> Heavy losses in North American auto operations sent GM 's net tumbling to $ 516.9 million from a record $ 859.2 million . </s>
<s> Detroit-based GM does n't issue separate quarterly earnings for the North American automotive business . </s>
<s> But analysts estimated that GM had a loss of as much as $ 300 million on domestic vehicle operations . </s>
<s> An 8.5 % drop in North American factory sales of cars and trucks cut into revenue , and rebates to dealers and customers more than offset gains from price increases on 1990 model vehicles delivered during the period , a GM spokesman said . </s>
<s> But GM 's results also illustrate the increasing diversity of its operations . </s>
<s> In one breakdown , GM attributed half of its net to its two big technology units , Electronic Data Systems Corp. and GM Hughes Electronics Corp . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , GM said overseas auto operations are on track to exceed last year 's record full-year net of $ 2.7 billion . </s>
<s> The diversified operations helped GM build its cash reserves , exclusive of its financial subsidiary , to $ 5.5 billion as of Sept. 30 , a 22 % increase from a year earlier . </s>
<s> This cushion could come in handy if GM has to trim fourth-quarter North American production schedules more than the already scheduled 9.5 % . </s>
<s> Under the circumstances , it wo n't be easy for GM to exceed its record 1988 fourth-quarter net of $ 1.4 billion , the spokesman acknowledged . </s>
<s> That means it 's unlikely the company will surpass last year 's $ 4.9 billion full-year profit , even though net for the first nine months was up 1.9 % to $ 3.52 billion on revenue of $ 95.57 billion . </s>
<s> It earned $ 3.46 billion on revenue of $ 91.21 billion in the 1988 nine months . </s>
