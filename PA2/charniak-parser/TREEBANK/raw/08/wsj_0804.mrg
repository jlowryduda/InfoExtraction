<s> An enormous turtle has succeeded where the government has failed : He has made speaking Filipino respectable . </s>
<s> The 6 1\/2-foot-tall turtle , Pong Pagong , is a character who stars in the children 's television show `` Batibot . '' </s>
<s> He speaks only in Filipino . </s>
<s> `` Batibot , '' which started in 1983 as a hybrid of the U.S. program `` Sesame Street , '' has developed into a distinctly Philippine effort . </s>
<s> Radio programs and books have followed the daily television show . </s>
<s> In the process , `` Batibot , '' an archaic Filipino word meaning `` strong '' or `` enduring , '' has become a powerful advocate of the use of the Filipino language . </s>
<s> `` It impresses on ordinary , young Filipinos that there 's nothing to feel inferior about in using their own language , '' says Randy David , a sociologist and host of a popular television talk show . </s>
<s> `` When we started the program six years ago , the use of Filipino was deemed unwise by the predominantly middle class , '' says Lydia Brown , the program 's creator . </s>
<s> Now , she says , `` it 's no longer an issue . '' </s>
<s> The success of `` Batibot '' stands in marked contrast to many academic and government attempts to promote Filipino as a national language . </s>
<s> Filipino -- once known as Pilipino -- is predominantly Tagalog , the Malay-based language spoken in a part of the country 's principal island of Luzon . </s>
<s> Resistance to a national language comes primarily from members of the country 's elite , who generally prefer English . </s>
<s> But while better-off Filipinos are quick to cite the logic in using a language as widespread as English , they are often slow to reveal that they are prejudiced against Filipino , say advocates of the native language . </s>
<s> `` For the middle and upper-middle class -LCB- Filipino -RCB- is declasse , '' says Bien Lumbera , a Philippine-studies professor at Quezon City 's University of the Philippines . </s>
<s> There 's also resentment . </s>
<s> Other opponents of Filipino come from non-Tagalog regions . </s>
<s> They argue that their own languages should have equal weight , although recent surveys indicate that the majority of the country 's population understands Filipino more than any other language . </s>
<s> -LRB- There are seven major languages and more than 70 dialects in the country . -RRB- </s>
<s> What tongue to speak is an emotional mine field in the Philippines . </s>
<s> It is entrenched in the country 's colonial bonds to the U.S. , in Philippine class structure , in the regional loyalties of its people and in its island geography . </s>
<s> As they did when the Philippines was a colony of the U.S. , teachers for the most part teach in English , even though it is a foreign language for most Philippine children . </s>
<s> As a result , they often speak one language at home , another at school . </s>
<s> Mrs. Brown calls the modern-day cultural ambivalence to Filipino a `` language schizophrenia . '' </s>
<s> The issue has been simmering for years . </s>
<s> It does n't take much to provoke an intense debate . </s>
<s> When President Corazon Aquino , whose command of Filipino is spotty , announced last year that the language would be used in official communications , there was an uproar from many legislators , who continue to conduct debates mostly in English . </s>
<s> But many proponents of Filipino see resistance to the language finally crumbling . </s>
<s> They believe the media , including `` Batibot , '' have played a crucial role . </s>
<s> According to chief scriptwriter Rene Villanueva , `` Batibot '' does n't set out to advance the cause of Filipino . </s>
<s> `` It 's not as if we 're teaching language per se , '' he says , `` We 're just using it . '' </s>
<s> These days , `` Batibot '' is produced in a converted lumberyard on a shoestring budget of $ 3,000 a one-hour segment . </s>
<s> It is shown weekdays on two of the country 's five networks . </s>
<s> With an audience totaling more than 400,000 , `` Batibot '' consistently ranks in the country 's top-four most-watched daytime programs . </s>
<s> But advertising revenue is inadequate . </s>
<s> Periodically , there are threats that the program will fold . </s>
<s> `` Batibot '' lacks the polish of `` Sesame Street . '' </s>
<s> Sound stages echo . </s>
<s> Acting sometimes falls flat . </s>
<s> There are only two large puppets in the program : Pong Pagong and a monkey named Kiko Matsing . </s>
<s> But the production is the equal of any local program . </s>
<s> And the show 's creativity makes up for any technological deficiencies . </s>
<s> The program is n't afraid to tackle controversial topics such as nuclear weapons and the environment . </s>
<s> Not that the language war is won , even on `` Batibot . '' </s>
<s> During one recent episode , all the advertisements were in English . </s>
