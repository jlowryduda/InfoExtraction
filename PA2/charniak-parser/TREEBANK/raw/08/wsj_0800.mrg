<s> The growing crowd of Japanese investors buying up foreign companies are n't all strait-laced businessmen in dark suits . </s>
<s> Yasumichi Morishita , whose art gallery last month became a major shareholder in Christies International PLC , the London auction house , is one man who does n't fit the mold . </s>
<s> In Japan , he 's known in racy weekly magazines as the `` King of Shady Money . '' </s>
<s> If nothing else , the 57-year-old 's past has its share of dents . </s>
<s> Nearly 20 years ago , Mr. Morishita , founder and chairman of Aichi Corp. , a finance company , received a 10-month suspended sentence from a Tokyo court for violating a money-lending law and an income tax law . </s>
<s> He was convicted of charging interest rates much higher than what the law permitted , and attempting to evade income taxes by using a double accounting system . </s>
<s> He 's had other brushes with the law . </s>
<s> He was arrested , though not indicted , on at least three other occasions in the '60s and '70s : for assault and unlawful confinement , for fraud and forgery of private documents , and for extortion . </s>
<s> Christies says it has had no contact with Mr. Morishita since the stock purchase , but that it 's happy to deal with him . </s>
<s> `` We like to make our own judgments '' about Mr. Morishita , says Christopher Davidge , Christies ' group managing director . </s>
<s> `` People have a different reputation country by country . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Morishita is a leading figure among Japan 's 38,000 `` machikin , '' which lend to small companies , and `` sarakin , '' which lend to individuals . </s>
<s> Many of these financiers lend freely , often without demanding collateral . </s>
<s> But the interest rates they charge are often near Japan 's 54.75 % legal limit , says Kenji Utsunomiya , a lawyer specializing in loan troubles . </s>
<s> Aichi is a machikin , Mr. Utsunomiya says , and `` one of the nasty ones . '' </s>
<s> In describing that business in general , he says that when the client ca n't repay the loan , some machikin `` clutch on like hyenas '' and even take over the client 's company . </s>
<s> Last month , Mr. Morishita 's new gallery , Aska International Ltd. , purchased 6.4 % of Christies for # 33 million -LRB- $ 53.3 million -RRB- . </s>
<s> Acquired from Carisbrook Holdings U.K. Ltd. , a company owned by Australian financier Robert Holmes a Court , the stake was apparently the first of its kind for Aska , an entity separate from Aichi . </s>
<s> And the acquisition , which made Aska one of Christies ' top five shareholders , left many people wondering who this man was and what his intentions were . </s>
<s> `` We 're an investor , '' Mr. Morishita says , sitting back in his purple gallery filled with some 20 Monets and Renoirs . </s>
<s> `` In the long run , the -LCB- stock -RCB- prices will go up . '' </s>
<s> It 's not clear whether Aska plans to buy more shares . </s>
<s> But Christies , Mr. Morishita insists , is happy to see him become a long-term stockholder . </s>
<s> Mr. Morishita considers himself a connoisseur of art . </s>
<s> In 30 years of collecting impressionist and Japanese paintings , he has acquired 600 items , he says , enough to persuade him to start a museum next year . </s>
<s> He says he spent $ 300 million on his art business this year . </s>
<s> A week ago , his gallery racked up a $ 23 million tab at a Sotheby 's auction in New York buying seven works , including a Picasso . </s>
<s> `` He makes snap judgments , '' says Kiyotaka Kori , the art gallery 's manager and Mr. Morishita 's secretary for more than seven years . </s>
<s> Mr. Morishita 's main business certainly appears to be thriving , although he wo n't disclose numbers . </s>
<s> According to Teikoku Data Bank Ltd. , which tracks company earnings , Aichi 's revenue rose 15 % to 49.3 billion yen -LRB- $ 348.4 million -RRB- in the year ended February . </s>
<s> Revenue doubled from two years ago . </s>
<s> That is , if the company reported results correctly . </s>
<s> The Asahi Shimbun , a Japanese daily , last month reported that Aichi revised its tax calculations after being challenged for allegedly failing to report all of its income to tax authorities over a two-year period . </s>
<s> The Tokyo Regional Taxation Office declines to comment , and Mr. Kori , the tycoon 's secretary , says the problem simply resulted from a difference of opinion over what was considered income . </s>
<s> The small , wiry Mr. Morishita comes across as an outspoken man of the world . </s>
<s> Stretching his arms in his silky white shirt and squeaking his black shoes , he lectures a visitor about the way to sell American real estate and boasts about his friendship with Margaret Thatcher 's son . </s>
<s> But when asked what exactly he does in business , he immediately takes offense . </s>
<s> `` Are you stupid ? '' he snaps . </s>
<s> `` You should know what questions to ask to get people to answer . '' </s>
<s> Not many people know the details of Mr. Morishita 's business , but it 's a source of rumors about shady dealings . </s>
<s> When a small company goes belly-up , for instance , the gossipy weekly magazines are often quick to link the demise with Aichi . </s>
<s> Mr. Morishita scoffs at those stories , as well as the ones connecting him to the Japanese mob . </s>
<s> He says he has never even dined with gangsters . </s>
<s> The seventh child of a store owner in Aichi prefecture , Mr. Morishita started out in the textile business . </s>
<s> From there , he set up his finance company and rapidly expanded from lending to investment in real estate to building golf courses . </s>
<s> He spends most weekends flying his helicopter to one of his nine courses , he says , two of which were designed by Jack Nicklaus . </s>
<s> He also owns courses in the U.S. and France . </s>
<s> The gruff financier recently started socializing in upper-class circles . </s>
<s> Although he says he was n't keen on going , last year he attended a New York gala where his daughter made her debut . </s>
<s> He also leads an opulent life style . </s>
<s> Even in Denenchofu , one of Tokyo 's richest neighborhoods , Mr. Morishita 's splashy brick manor -- one of some 10 houses he owns -- outshines the neighbors ' . </s>
<s> A lavish white portico with a stained-glass window towers over the brick wall surrounding his property . </s>
<s> Although Mr. Morishita says little about his business , he offers one rule to success : Never gamble too far . </s>
<s> `` I quit after one try , whether I win or lose , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` I 'm done in two minutes . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Morishita says he intends to expand his business to many other areas at home and abroad . </s>
<s> He 'll be there wherever there 's money to be made , laughs Mr. Kori , the secretary . </s>
<s> `` Who knows , '' he says , `` if he heard that soybeans make money today , he might be flying out to Chicago tomorrow . </s>
