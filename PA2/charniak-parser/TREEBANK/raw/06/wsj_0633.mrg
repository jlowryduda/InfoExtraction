<s> These are the last words Abbie Hoffman ever uttered , more or less , before he killed himself . </s>
<s> And You Are There , sort of : </s>
<s> ABBIE : `` I 'm OK , Jack . </s>
<s> I 'm OK . '' </s>
<s> -LRB- listening -RRB- `` Yeah . </s>
<s> I 'm out of bed . </s>
<s> I got my feet on the floor . </s>
<s> Yeah . </s>
<s> Two feet . </s>
<s> I 'll see you Wednesday ? ... Thursday . '' </s>
<s> He listens impassively . </s>
<s> ABBIE -LRB- cont'd. -RRB- : `` I 'll always be with you , Jack . </s>
<s> Do n't worry . '' </s>
<s> Abbie lies back and leaves the frame empty . </s>
<s> Of course that was n't the actual conversation the late anti-war activist , protest leader and founder of the Yippies ever had with his brother . </s>
<s> It 's a script pieced together from interviews by CBS News for a re-enactment , a dramatic rendering by an actor of Mr. Hoffman 's ultimately unsuccessful struggle with depression . </s>
<s> The segment is soon to be broadcast on the CBS News series `` Saturday Night With Connie Chung , '' thus further blurring the distinction between fiction and reality in TV news . </s>
<s> It is the New Journalism come to television . </s>
<s> Ms. Chung 's program is just one of several network shows -LRB- and many more in syndication -RRB- that rely on the controversial technique of reconstructing events , using actors who are supposed to resemble real people , living and dead . </s>
<s> Ms. Chung 's , however , is said to be the only network news program in history to employ casting directors . </s>
<s> Abbie Hoffman in this case is to be played by Hollywood actor Paul Lieber , who is n't new to the character . </s>
<s> He was Mr. Hoffman in a 1979 Los Angeles production of a play called `` The Chicago Conspiracy Trial . '' </s>
<s> Television news , of course , has always been part show-biz . </s>
<s> Broadcasters have a healthy appreciation of the role entertainment values play in captivating an audience . </s>
<s> But , as CBS Broadcast Group president Howard Stringer puts it , the network now needs to `` broaden the horizons of nonfiction television , and that includes some experimentation . '' </s>
<s> Since its premiere Sept. 16 , the show on which Ms. Chung appears has used an actor to portray the Rev. Vernon Johns , a civil-rights leader , and one to play a teenage drug dealer . </s>
<s> It has depicted the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over the Scottish town of Lockerbie . </s>
<s> On Oct. 21 , it did a rendition of the kidnapping and imprisonment of Associated Press correspondent Terry Anderson , who was abducted in March 1985 and is believed to be held in Lebanon . </s>
<s> The production had actors playing Mr. Anderson and former hostages David Jacobsen , the Rev. Benjamin Weir and Father Lawrence Jenco . </s>
<s> ABC News has similarly branched out into entertainment gimmickry . </s>
<s> `` Prime Time Live , '' a new show this season featuring Sam Donaldson and Diane Sawyer , has a studio audience that applauds and that one night -LRB- to the embarrassment of the network -RRB- waved at the camera like the crowd on `` Let 's Make a Deal . '' </s>
<s> -LRB- ABC stops short of using an `` applause '' sign and a comic to warm up the audience . </s>
<s> The stars do that themselves . -RRB- </s>
<s> NBC News has produced three episodes of an occasional series produced by Sid Feders called `` Yesterday , Today and Tomorrow , '' starring Maria Shriver , Chuck Scarborough and Mary Alice Williams , that also gives work to actors . </s>
<s> Call it a fad . </s>
<s> Or call it the wave of the future . </s>
<s> NBC 's re-creations are produced by Cosgrove-Meurer Productions , which also makes the successful prime-time NBC Entertainment series `` Unsolved Mysteries . '' </s>
<s> The marriage of news and theater , if not exactly inevitable , has been consummated nonetheless . </s>
<s> News programs , particularly if they score well in the ratings , appeal to the networks ' cost-conscious corporate parents because they are so much less expensive to produce than an entertainment show is -- somewhere between $ 400,000 and $ 500,000 for a one-hour program . </s>
<s> Entertainment shows tend to cost twice that . </s>
<s> Re-enactments have been used successfully for several seasons on such syndicated `` tabloid TV '' shows as `` A Current Affair , '' which is produced by the Fox Broadcasting Co. unit of Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp . </s>
<s> That show , whose host is Ms. Chung 's husband , Maury Povich , has a particular penchant for grisly murders and stories having to do with sex -- the Robert Chambers murder case , the Rob Lowe tapes , what have you . </s>
<s> Gerald Stone , the executive producer of `` A Current Affair , '' says , `` We have opened eyes to being a little less conservative and more imaginative in how to present the news . '' </s>
<s> Nowhere have eyes been opened wider than at CBS News . </s>
<s> At 555 W. 57th St. in Manhattan , one floor below the offices of `` 60 Minutes , '' the most successful prime-time news program ever , actors wait in the reception area to audition for `` Saturday Night With Connie Chung . '' </s>
<s> CBS News sends scripts to agents , who pass them along to clients . </s>
<s> The network deals a lot with unknowns , including Scott Wentworth , who portrayed Mr. Anderson , and Bill Alton as Father Jenco , but the network has some big names to contend with , too . </s>
<s> James Earl Jones is cast to play the Rev. Mr. Johns . </s>
<s> Ned Beatty may portray former California Gov. Pat Brown in a forthcoming epsiode on Caryl Chessman , the last man to be executed in California , in 1960 . </s>
<s> `` Saturday Night '' has cast actors to appear in future stories ranging from the abortion rights of teen-agers to a Nov. 4 segment on a man named Willie Bosket , who calls himself a `` monster '' and is reputed to be the toughest prisoner in New York . </s>
<s> CBS News , which as recently as two years ago fired hundreds of its employees in budget cutbacks , now hires featured actors beginning at $ 2,700 a week . </s>
<s> That is n't much compared with what Bill Cosby makes , or even Connie Chung for that matter -LRB- who is paid $ 1.6 million a year and who recently did a guest shot of her own on the sitcom `` Murphy Brown '' -RRB- . </s>
<s> But the money is n't peanuts either , particularly for a news program . </s>
<s> CBS News is also re-enacting the 1979 Three Mile Island nuclear accident in Middletown , Pa. , with something less than a cast of thousands . </s>
<s> It is combing the town of 10,000 for about 200 extras . </s>
<s> On Oct. 20 , the town 's mayor , Robert Reid , made an announcement on behalf of CBS during half-time at the Middletown High School football game asking for volunteers . </s>
<s> `` There was a roll of laughter through the stands , '' says Joe Sukle , the editor of the weekly Press and Journal in Middletown . </s>
<s> `` They 're filming right now at the bank down the street , and they want shots of people getting out of cars and kids on skateboards . </s>
<s> They are approaching everyone on the street and asking if they want to be in a docudrama . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Sukle says he would n't dream of participating himself : </s>
<s> `` No way . </s>
<s> I think re-enactments stink . '' </s>
<s> Though a re-enactment may have the flavor , Hollywood on the Hudson it is n't . </s>
<s> Some producers seem tentative about the technique , squeamish even . </s>
<s> So the results , while not news , are n't exactly theater either , at least not good theater . </s>
<s> And some people do think that acting out scripts is n't worthy of CBS News , which once lent prestige to the network and set standards for the industry . </s>
<s> In his review of `` Saturday Night With Connie Chung , '' Tom Shales , the TV critic of the Washington Post and generally an admirer of CBS , wrote that while the show is `` impressive , ... one has to wonder if this is the proper direction for a network news division to take . '' </s>
<s> Re-creating events has , in general , upset news traditionalists , including former CBS News President Richard S. Salant and former NBC News President Reuven Frank , former CBS News anchorman Walter Cronkite and the new dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism , Joan Konner . </s>
<s> Says she : `` Once you add dramatizations , it 's no longer news , it 's drama , and that has no place on a network news broadcast ... . </s>
<s> They should never be on . </s>
<s> Never . '' </s>
<s> Criticism of the Abbie Hoffman segment is particularly scathing among people who knew and loved the man . </s>
<s> That includes his companion of 15 years , Johanna Lawrenson , as well as his former wife , Anita . </s>
<s> Both women say they also find it distasteful that CBS News is apparently concentrating on Mr. Hoffman 's problems as a manic-depressive . </s>
<s> `` This is dangerous and misrepresents Abbie 's life , '' says Ms. Lawrenson , who has had an advance look at the 36-page script . </s>
<s> `` It 's a sensational piece about someone who is not here to defend himself . '' </s>
<s> Mrs. Hoffman says that dramatization `` makes the truth flexible . </s>
<s> It takes one person 's account and gives it authenticity . '' </s>
<s> CBS News interviewed Jack Hoffman and his sister , Phyllis , as well as Mr. Hoffman 's landlord in Solebury Township , Pa . </s>
<s> Also Jonathan Silvers , who collaborated with Mr. Hoffman on two books . </s>
<s> Mr. Silvers says , `` I wanted to be interviewed to get Abbie 's story out , and maybe talking about the illness will do some good . '' </s>
<s> The executive producer of `` Saturday Night With Connie Chung , '' Andrew Lack , declines to discuss re-creactions as a practice or his show , in particular . </s>
<s> `` I do n't talk about my work , '' he says . </s>
<s> The president of CBS News , David W. Burke , did n't return numerous telephone calls . </s>
<s> One person close to the process says it would not be in the best interest of CBS News to comment on a `` work in progress , '' such as the Hoffman re-creation , but says CBS News is `` aware '' of the concerns of Ms. Lawrenson and Mr. Hoffman 's former wife . </s>
<s> Neither woman was invited by CBS News to participate in a round-table discussion about Mr. Hoffman that is to follow the re-enactment . </s>
<s> Mr. Lieber , the actor who plays Mr. Hoffman , says he was concerned at first that the script would `` misrepresent an astute political mind , one that I admired , '' but that his concerns were allayed . </s>
<s> The producers , he says , did a good job of depicting someone `` who had done so much , but who was also a manic-depressive . </s>
