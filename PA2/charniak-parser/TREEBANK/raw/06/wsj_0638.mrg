<s> Texas Instruments Inc. , once a pioneer in portable computer technology , today will make a bid to reassert itself in that business by unveiling three small personal computers . </s>
<s> The announcements are scheduled to be made in Temple , Texas , and include a so-called `` notebook '' PC that weighs less than seven pounds , has a built-in hard disk drive and is powered by Intel Corp. 's 286 microprocessor . </s>
<s> That introduction comes only two weeks after Compaq Computer Corp. , believing it had a lead of three to six months on competitors , introduced the first U.S. notebook computer with such features . </s>
<s> Despite the inevitable comparison with Compaq , however , Texas Instruments ' new notebook wo n't be a direct competitor . </s>
<s> While Compaq sells its machines to businesses through computer retailers , Texas Instruments will be selling most of its machines to the industrial market and to value-added resellers and original-equipment manufacturers . </s>
<s> The introductions also mark Texas Instruments ' plunge back into a technology it has all but ignored for the past several years . </s>
<s> Although the Dallas-based computer giant introduced the first portable data terminal in 1971 -- a 38-pound monster -- and the world 's first microprocessor-based portable in 1976 , the only portable machines it has introduced since the first part of the decade have been `` dumb '' terminals with limited on-board processing ability . </s>
<s> It stopped selling a standard personal computer a while ago . </s>
<s> Now that is about to change , as Texas Instruments begins marketing two 14-pound laptop PCs with 20 megabyte and 40 megabyte hard drives . </s>
<s> The laptops are not revolutionary and , indeed , are tardy in a market first opened by GRiD Systems Corp. , now a unit of Tandy Corp. , almost two years ago . </s>
<s> But the notebook , with the more advanced microprocessor and hard disk , is more innovative . </s>
<s> Weighing 6.7 pounds with battery , the notebook measures 8.2 by 11.7 inches , has a 20-megabyte hard disk drive and boasts a backlit screen that is 22 % larger than Compaq 's . </s>
<s> Its keyboard , according to industry consultants , is better than Compaq 's , but its battery life of two to three hours is shorter . </s>
<s> It does n't have an internal floppy disk drive , although a snap-on drive can be purchased separately . </s>
<s> Its greatest drawback may be its 3-inch thickness , big enough for one consultant to describe it as `` clunky . '' </s>
<s> List prices on the heavier Texas Instrument laptops will be $ 4,999 for the TI Model 25 , with a 20 megabyte disk drive , and $ 5,599 for the 40-megabyte Model 45 . </s>
<s> The notebook , the TI Model 12 , will be priced at $ 4,199 . </s>
