<s> The fiscal 1989 budget deficit figure came out Friday . </s>
<s> It was down a little . </s>
<s> The next time you hear a Member of Congress moan about the deficit , consider what Congress did Friday . </s>
<s> The Senate , 84-6 , voted to increase to $ 124,000 the ceiling on insured mortgages from the FHA , which lost $ 4.2 billion in loan defaults last year . </s>
<s> Then , by voice vote , the Senate voted a pork-barrel bill , approved Thursday by the House , for domestic military construction . </s>
<s> Compare the Bush request to what the Senators gave themselves : </s>
<s> For construction in West Virginia , Mr. Bush requested $ 4.5 million ; Congress gave Senator Byrd 's state $ 21.5 million . </s>
<s> Senator Byrd is chairman of the Appropriations Committee . </s>
<s> For Iowa , a $ 1.8 million request became $ 12 million for Senator Grassley , ranking minority member of a military construction subcommittee . </s>
<s> Rep. Jamie Whitten of Mississippi and chairman of House Appropriations turned a $ 20 million Bush request for his state into a $ 49.7 million bequest . </s>
<s> Senator Sasser of Tennessee is chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee on military construction ; Mr. Bush 's $ 87 million request for Tennessee increased to $ 109 million . </s>
<s> In a remark someone should remember this time next year , Senator Sasser said , `` I think we 've seen the peak of military construction spending for many years to come . '' </s>
