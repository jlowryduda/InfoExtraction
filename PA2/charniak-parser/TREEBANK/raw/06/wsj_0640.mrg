<s> Retailers in the West and parts of the South are entering the critical Christmas shopping season with more momentum than those in other regions . </s>
<s> In a new report , the International Council of Shopping Centers said sales of general merchandise in the West for the first seven months of 1989 rose 6.6 % above year-earlier levels . </s>
<s> Sales increased a more modest 4.8 % in the South and 4.4 % in the Midwest . </s>
<s> But sales in the oil-patch state of Texas surged 12.9 % and sales in South Carolina jumped 10.6 % in the period , the New York trade group said . </s>
<s> In the Northeast , however , sales declined 0.4 % in the period , with sales in New England falling 2.6 % . </s>
<s> The numbers show that `` we do n't have a monolithic economy , '' said Isaac Lagnado , council research director . </s>
<s> `` There are a lot of have and have-not markets . '' </s>
<s> Sales nationally rose 3.9 % through July , the latest month for which the figures are available , the council said . </s>
<s> The Northern California earthquake and Hurricane Hugo are likely to temporarily damp sales growth in the West and South Carolina . </s>
<s> But Mr. Lagnado predicted the regional trends would continue through Christmas . </s>
<s> `` The big mo is as much of a factor in retailing as in politics , '' he said . </s>
<s> The Christmas quarter is important to retailers because it represents roughly a third of their sales and nearly half of their profits . </s>
<s> The council 's report is based on data the trade group buys from the U.S. Census Bureau . </s>
<s> The information on 125 metropolitan markets is supplied by retailers such as Sears , Roebuck & Co. and K mart Corp. as well as closely held concerns such as R.H. Macy & Co . </s>
<s> The council plans to release its regional reports monthly . </s>
<s> Mr. Lagnado said strength in employment appears to have the biggest impact on sales growth . </s>
<s> El Paso , Austin and Fort Worth , the three strongest retail markets in the nation , are all located in Texas , where employment grew a relatively strong 2 % . </s>
<s> Massachusetts , which has lost jobs in the computer and defense-related industries , was the weakest link in bleak New England . </s>
<s> The results reflect a reversal in the fortunes of the regions during the past two years . </s>
<s> In 1987 , the West had the slowest sales growth , and the South and the Midwest were first and second respectively , according to the council . </s>
<s> Mr. Lagnado said that although retailers probably wo n't ever recover sales lost because of the California quake and Hurricane Hugo , they could see some benefits later on . </s>
<s> Stores such as Sears that sell big-ticket durable goods might actually get a boost as consumers rush to replace items lost in the disasters , he said . </s>
