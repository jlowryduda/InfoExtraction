<s> Mobil Corp. is in the midst of cutting back its exploration and production group , which finds and develops oil and gas reserves in the U.S. , by as much as 15 % as part of a new restructuring of that sector of its business . </s>
<s> Management advised employees Friday that it was going to reduce employment in production operations of the group by 8 % , or 400 people . </s>
<s> The exploration side of the unit has recently undergone a similar overhaul , during which it also lost as many as 400 employees , a company spokesman said in response to questions . </s>
<s> Mobil Exploration & Producing U.S. Inc. , the group involved , currently has a work force of somewhat less than 5,000 . </s>
<s> A few years ago , Mobil restructured the entire company during an industrywide shakeout . </s>
<s> But since then U.S. oil production has declined and Mobil wants to focus its oil-finding efforts overseas . </s>
<s> Mobil alluded to the work-force cuts last week when it took a $ 40 million charge as part of its third-quarter earnings and attributed it to a restructuring . </s>
<s> Mobil officials said that it is unlikely any additional charges related to this move will be taken in future quarters . </s>
<s> On Wednesday , Mobil will begin offering separation packages and voluntary retirement in its U.S. production operation . </s>
<s> Mobil officials said they have been studying ways of streamlining these operations since early this year . </s>
<s> During the coming months , layers of management will be peeled away and regional offices will become more autonomous . </s>
<s> For greater efficiency , employees at those locations will be reorganized into teams responsible for managing the properties under their jurisdiction , Mobil said . </s>
<s> `` The main feature of the new organization is that each local manager will have both the authority and accountability for profitable and technically sound operations , '' said Charles E. Spruell , president of the Mobil unit . </s>
<s> Field offices at New Orleans ; Houston ; Denver ; Midland , Tex. ; Bakersfield , Calif. ; Oklahoma City ; and Liberal , Kan. , will be maintained . </s>
<s> But the staffs at some of those locations will be slashed while at others the work force will be increased . </s>
<s> For instance , employment in Denver will be reduced to 105 from 430 . </s>
<s> But on the West Coast , where profitable oil production is more likely than in the midcontinent region , the Bakersfield , Calif. , office staff of 130 will grow by 175 to 305 . </s>
<s> The reorganization will `` focus on the value and potential of assets , '' Mr. Spruell said . </s>
