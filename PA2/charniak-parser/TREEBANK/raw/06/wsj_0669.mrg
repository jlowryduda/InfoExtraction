<s> Nissan Motor Co. expects net income to reach 120 billion yen -LRB- U.S. $ 857 million -RRB- in its current fiscal year , up from 114.6 billion yen in the previous year , Yutaka Kume , president , said . </s>
<s> Mr. Kume made the earnings projection for fiscal 1990 , ending next March 31 , in an interview with U.S. automotive writers attending the Tokyo Motor Show . </s>
<s> The executive said that the anticipated earnings increase is fairly modest because Nissan is spending heavily to bolster its dealership network in Japan and because of currency-exchange fluctuations . </s>
<s> During the next decade , Mr. Kume said , Nissan plans to boost overseas vehicle production sufficiently to account for a majority of sales outside Japan . </s>
<s> Last year , Mr. Kume said , Nissan exported slightly over one million vehicles , and produced 570,000 cars and trucks at its factories in North America , Europe and Australia . </s>
<s> But by 1992 , he added , Nissan will build one million vehicles a year outside Japan , or sufficient to equal exports . </s>
<s> `` By the end of the 1990s , '' he said , `` we want to be producing roughly two vehicles overseas for every vehicle that we export from Japan . '' </s>
<s> That will involve a substantial increase in overseas manufacturing capacity , he acknowledged , but did n't provide specific details . </s>
