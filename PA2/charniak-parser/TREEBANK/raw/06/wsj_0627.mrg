<s> October employment data -- also could turn out to be the most confusing . </s>
<s> On the surface , the overall unemployment rate is expected to be little changed from September 's 5.3 % . </s>
<s> But the actual head count of non-farm employment payroll jobs is likely to be muddied by the impact of Hurricane Hugo , strikes , and less-than-perfect seasonal adjustments , economists said . </s>
<s> The consensus view calls for an overall job gain of 155,000 compared with September 's 209,000 increase . </s>
<s> But the important factory-jobs segment , which last month plunged by 103,000 positions and raised recession fears , is most likely to be skewed by the month 's unusual events . </s>
<s> Several other reports come before Friday 's jobs data , including : the September leading indicators index , new-home sales and October agricultural prices reports due out tomorrow ; the October purchasing managers ' index and September construction spending and manufacturers ' orders on Wednesday ; and October chain-store sales on Thursday . </s>
<s> Friday brings the final count on October auto sales . </s>
<s> `` The employment report is going to be difficult to interpret , '' said Michael Englund , economist with MMS International , a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc. , New York . </s>
<s> Mr. Englund added that next month 's data is n't likely to be much better , because it will be distorted by San Francisco 's earthquake . </s>
<s> What 's more , he believes seasonal swings in the auto industry this year are n't occurring at the same time as in the past , because of production and pricing differences that are curbing the accuracy of seasonal adjustments built into the employment data . </s>
<s> Wednesday 's report from the purchasing agents will be watched to see if the index maintains a level below 50 % , as it has for the past couple of months . </s>
<s> A reading of less than 50 % indicates an economy that is generally contracting while a reading above 50 % indicates an economy that 's expanding . </s>
<s> Samuel D. Kahan , chief financial economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc. , Chicago , said that the purchasers ' report is valuable because it often presents the first inkling of economic data for the month . </s>
<s> But he added : `` Some people use the purchasers ' index as a leading indicator , some use it as a coincident indicator . </s>
<s> But the thing it 's supposed to measure -- manufacturing strength -- it missed altogether last month . '' </s>
<s> David Wyss , chief financial economist at Data Resources Inc. , Boston , said that the purchasers ' index `` does miss occasionally , '' adding : `` When it misses one month it tends to miss the next month , too . '' </s>
<s> The consensus view on September leading indicators calls for a gain of 0.3 % , the same as in August . </s>
<s> Economists said greatly increased consumer optimism , a larger money supply and higher stock prices helped lift the index . </s>
<s> All orders-related components , such as consumer-goods orders and building permits , are thought to have been weaker . </s>
<s> Data Resources ' Mr. Wyss added that he will be keeping a closer eye than ususal on October chain-store sales . </s>
<s> Usually , October `` is n't a very interesting month -LCB- for retail figures -RCB- because school clothes have been bought and people are waiting for December to buy Christmas presents , '' he said . </s>
<s> But Mr. Wyss said he will watch the numbers to get an inkling of whether consumers ' general buying habits may slack off as much as their auto-buying apparently has . </s>
<s> He noted that higher gasoline prices will help buoy the October totals . </s>
<s> Seasonal factors are also expected to have taken their toll on September new-home sales , which are believed to have fallen sharply from August 's 755,000 units . </s>
<s> Construction spending is believed to have slipped about 0.5 % from August levels , although economists noted the rate probably will pick up in the months ahead in response to hurricane and earthquake damage . </s>
