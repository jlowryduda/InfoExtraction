<s> Time Warner Inc. is considering a legal challenge to Tele-Communications Inc. 's plan to buy half of Showtime Networks Inc. , a move that could lead to all-out war between the cable industry 's two most powerful players . </s>
<s> Time is also fighting the transaction on other fronts , by attempting to discourage other cable operators from joining Tele-Communications as investors in Showtime , cable-TV industry executives say . </s>
<s> Time officials declined to comment . </s>
<s> Last week , Tele-Communications agreed to pay Viacom Inc. $ 225 million for a 50 % stake in its Showtime subsidiary , which is a distant second to Time 's Home Box Office in the delivery of pay-TV networks to cable subscribers . </s>
<s> Tele-Communications , the U.S. 's largest cable company , said it may seek other cable partners to join in its investment . </s>
<s> Tele-Communications is HBO 's largest customer , and the two have a number of other business relationships . </s>
<s> Earlier this year , Time even discussed bringing Tele-Communications in as an investor in HBO , executives at both companies said . </s>
<s> The purchase of the Showtime stake is `` a direct slap in our face , '' said one senior Time executive . </s>
<s> Time is expected to mount a legal challenge in U.S. District Court in New York , where Viacom in May filed a $ 2.5 billion antitrust suit charging Time and HBO with monopolizing the pay-TV business and trying to crush competition from Showtime . </s>
<s> Executives involved in plotting Time 's defense say it is now preparing a countersuit naming both Viacom and Tele-Communications as defendants . </s>
<s> The executives say Time may seek to break up the transaction after it is consummated , or may seek constraints that would prevent Tele-Communications from dropping HBO in any of its cable systems in favor of Showtime . </s>
<s> Viacom officials declined to comment . </s>
<s> Jerome Kern , Tele-Communications ' chief outside counsel , said he was n't aware of Time 's legal plans . </s>
<s> But he said that any effort by Time to characterize the Tele-Communications investment in Showtime as anti-competitive would be `` the pot calling the kettle black . '' </s>
<s> `` It 's hard to see how an investment by the largest -LCB- cable operator -RCB- in the weaker of the two networks is anti-competitive , when the stronger of the two networks is owned by the second largest '' cable operator , Mr. Kern said . </s>
<s> In addition to owning HBO , with 22 million subscribers , Time Warner separately operates cable-TV system serving about 5.6 million cable-TV subscribers . </s>
<s> Tele-Communications controls close to 12 million cable subscribers , and Viacom has about one million . </s>
<s> In its suit against Time , Viacom says the ownership of both cable systems and cable-programming networks gives the company too much market power . </s>
<s> Time argues that in joining up with Tele-Communications , Viacom has potentially more power , particularly since Viacom also owns cable networks MTV , VH-1 and Nick at Nite . </s>
<s> Ironically , Tele-Communications and Time have often worked closely in the cable business . </s>
<s> Together , they control nearly 40 % of Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc. ; Tele-Communications has a 21.8 % stake , while Time Warner has a 17.8 % stake . </s>
<s> But since Time 's merger with Warner Communications Inc. , relations between the two have become strained . </s>
<s> Each company worries that the other is becoming too powerful and too vertically integrated . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , some legal observers say the Tele-Communications investment and other developments are weakening Viacom 's antitrust suit against Time . </s>
<s> Viacom accuses Time in its suit of refusing to carry Showtime or a sister service , The Movie Channel , on Time 's Manhattan Cable TV system , one of the nation 's largest urban systems . </s>
<s> But yesterday , Manhattan Cable announced it will launch Showtime on Nov. 1 to over 230,000 subscribers . </s>
<s> Showtime has also accused HBO of locking up the lion 's share of Hollywood 's movies by signing exclusive contracts with all the major studios . </s>
<s> But Showtime has continued to sign new contracts with Hollywood studios , and yesterday announced it will buy movies from Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. , which currently has a non-exclusive arrangement with HBO . </s>
