<s> Benjamin Jacobson & Sons has been the New York Stock Exchange specialist firm in charge of trading stock in UAL Corp. and its predecessors since the early 1930s . </s>
<s> But the firm has never had a day like yesterday . </s>
<s> At first UAL did n't open because of an order imbalance . </s>
<s> When it did a half-hour into the session , it was priced at $ 150 a share , down more than $ 28 from Monday 's close . </s>
<s> It sank further to as low as $ 145 , but a big rally developed in the last half hour , pushing the stock back up to close at $ 170 , down just $ 8.375 from Monday . </s>
<s> In the process , 4.9 million shares traded , making UAL the second most active issue on the Big Board . </s>
<s> Munching pizza when they could and yelling until their voices gave out , the two Benjamin Jacobson specialists at the Big Board 's UAL trading post yesterday presided over what can only be described as a financial free-for-all . </s>
<s> `` It was chaotic . </s>
<s> But we like to call it ` controlled chaos , ' '' said 47-year-old Robert J. Jacobson Jr. , grandson of the firm 's founder . </s>
<s> He manned the UAL post yesterday with Christopher Bates , 33 , an energetic Long Islander who 's a dead ringer for actor Nicolas Cage . </s>
<s> Who was doing all the selling ? </s>
<s> `` Options traders , arbitrage traders -- everyone , '' said Mr. Bates , cooling down with a carton of apple juice after the close yesterday . </s>
<s> Added Mr. Jacobson , `` There were some pretty bad losses in the stock . '' </s>
<s> Big Board traders said a 200,000-share buy order at $ 150 a share entered by Bear , Stearns & Co. , which was active in UAL stock all day , is what set off the UAL crowd in the late afternoon . </s>
<s> A subsequent rally in UAL helped the staggering stock market stage an astonishing recovery from an 80-point deficit to finish only slightly below Monday 's close . </s>
<s> Both Jacobson traders , who had been hoping UAL trading would get back to normal , read the news about the unraveling of UAL takeover plans on the train into work yesterday morning . </s>
<s> The news told them it would be a while longer before UAL resumed trading like a regular airline stock after months of gyrations . </s>
<s> When Mr. Jacobson walked into the office at 7:30 a.m. EDT , he announced : `` OK , buckle up . '' </s>
<s> Messrs. Jacobson and Bates walked on the Big Board floor at about 8:45 a.m. yesterday and immediately spotted trouble . </s>
<s> Already entered in the Big Board 's computers and transmitted to their post were sell orders for 65,000 UAL shares . </s>
<s> The UAL news had already caused a selling furor in the so-called third market , in which firms buy and sell stock away from the exchange floor . </s>
<s> UAL , which closed on the Big Board Monday at $ 178.375 a share , traded in the third market afterward as low as $ 158 a share . </s>
<s> There were rumors of $ 148-a-share trades . </s>
<s> In the 45 minutes before the 9:30 opening bell , the Jacobson specialists kept getting sell orders , heavier than they imagined . </s>
<s> And at 9:15 , they posted a $ 135 to $ 155 `` first indication , '' or the price range in which the stock would probably open . </s>
<s> That range was quickly narrowed to $ 145 to $ 155 , although traders surrounding the post were told that $ 148 to $ 150 would be the likely target . </s>
<s> When UAL finally opened a half hour late , some 400,000 shares traded at $ 150 . </s>
<s> There was `` selling pressure from everyone , '' said one trader . </s>
<s> This month 's Friday-the-13th market plunge spurred by UAL news was n't as bad for the Jacobson specialists as yesterday 's action . </s>
<s> On that earlier day , the stock 's trading was halted at a critical time so the specialists could catch their breath . </s>
<s> Not yesterday . </s>
<s> Mr. Jacobson , his gray hair flying , did n't wear out his red-white-and-blue sneakers , but he sweat so much he considered sending out for a new shirt . </s>
<s> Mr. Bates usually handles day-to-day UAL trading on his own . </s>
<s> But yesterday , the heavy trading action eventually consumed not only Messrs. Jacobson and Bates but four other Jacobson partners , all doing their specialist-firm job of tugging buyers and sellers together and adjusting prices to accommodate the market . </s>
<s> About 30 floor traders crammed near the UAL post most of the day , and probably hundreds more came and went -- a `` seething mass , '' as one trader described it . </s>
<s> The 4.9 million-share volume flowing through the Jacobson specialist operation was about five times normal for the stock . </s>
<s> The heavy buying in the last half hour led the specialists to take special steps . </s>
<s> The Bear Stearns order that marked the late-day turnaround caused a `` massive buying effort '' as UAL jumped $ 20 a share to $ 170 in the last half hour , said Mr. Bates . </s>
<s> With 15 seconds of trading to go , Mr. Jacobson , with what voice he had left , announced to the trading mob : `` We 're going to trade one price on the bell . '' </s>
<s> That meant no trading would occur in the final seconds , as a way of making sure that last-second orders are n't subjected to a sudden price swing that would upset customers . </s>
<s> About 11,000 shares sold at $ 170 on the bell , representing about eight to 10 late orders , the specialists estimate . </s>
<s> Big Board traders praised the Jacobson specialists for getting through yesterday without a trading halt . </s>
<s> In Chicago , a UAL spokesman , `` by way of policy , '' declined to comment on the company 's stock or the specialists ' performance . </s>
<s> Leaving the exchange at about 5 p.m. , the Jacobson specialists made no predictions about how trading might go today . </s>
<s> Said Earl Ellis , a Jacobson partner who got involved in the UAL action , `` It all starts all over again '' today . </s>
