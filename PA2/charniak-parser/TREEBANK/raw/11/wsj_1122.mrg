<s> DISASTER STATES are n't jumping to raise taxes for relief and recovery . </s>
<s> Not yet , anyway . </s>
<s> Just after Hurricane Hugo battered South Carolina , some officials talked of perhaps adding a penny to the state gasoline tax or raising property taxes . </s>
<s> Gov. Campbell responded , `` They 're mentioning rope when there 's been a hanging in the family . '' </s>
<s> A spokesman says the governor believes he can avoid increases by relying on federal aid and shifting funds in state programs . </s>
<s> Still , Hugo 's impact may revive unsuccessful proposals to give local governments authority to levy sales taxes . </s>
<s> A spokesman for North Carolina Gov. Martin says Hugo has n't prompted proposals for state or local increases . </s>
<s> California , where earthquake damage may top $ 5 billion , plans a special legislative session . </s>
<s> Property-tax relief is likely . </s>
<s> Legislators are talking about temporary rises in sales or gasoline taxes , although Gov. Deukmejian says they should be a last resort . </s>
<s> Needs are n't clear , and the state constitution makes increasing taxes and spending very difficult . </s>
<s> But some legislators think the time may be ripe to revise the constitution . </s>
<s> THE IRS WILL PAY if its error burdens you with bank charges . </s>
<s> Policy statement P-5-39 sets out terms . </s>
<s> As a result of an erroneous IRS levy on a bank account , a taxpayer may incur administrative and overdraft charges . </s>
<s> If the IRS admits its error and the charges have been paid , it will reimburse a taxpayer who has n't refused to give timely answers to IRS inquiries or has n't contributed to continuing or compounding the error . </s>
<s> The IRS recently amended the policy to cover stop-payment charges for checks lost by the IRS . </s>
<s> If the IRS asks for and gets a replacement for a check that it concedes it lost in processing , it will reimburse the taxpayer for the stop-payment charge on the original . </s>
<s> Reimbursement claims must be filed with the IRS district or service-center director within a year after the expense accrues . </s>
<s> If the IRS seeks late-payment interest because of the lost check , you should request interest abatement , publisher Prentice Hall notes . </s>
<s> JUST FIVE ACRES MORE are all we need to feel really at home , they say . </s>
<s> A couple we 'll call the Blandings spent nearly $ 800,000 on a 15-acre plot and main home and have an old $ 175,000 mortgage exempt from the new limit on mortgage-interest deductions . </s>
<s> They plan to expand the home site by buying five adjoining acres for $ 200,000 , borrowed against a first mortgage on the five acres and also collateralized by the 15 acres . </s>
<s> Their debt will be well under the $ 1 million limit -- on borrowing to acquire , build , or improve a home -- that qualifies for mortgage-interest deductions . </s>
<s> As you can guess , the Blandings want to deduct home-mortgage interest on the $ 200,000 loan . </s>
<s> But , IRS private ruling 8940061 notes , no rule or court case bears directly on the issue of adding land to a principal residence . </s>
<s> So the IRS has drawn a rationale from the sale of a home site split in two and sold in different years to the same buyer ; a court let the seller in that old case treat this as the sale of one residence . </s>
<s> Thus , the IRS says , the Blandings ' $ 200,000 loan is home-acquisition debt , and interest on it is fully deductible . </s>
<s> EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS facing imminent filing and payment deadlines will get extensions and penalty waivers like those provided for Hugo 's victims ; IRS Notice 89108 has details . </s>
<s> Notice 89-107 offers added relief for hurricane-hit concerns that must file pension and benefit-plan returns . </s>
<s> REPORTS OF PAYMENTS to independent contractors for services must be filed by businesses , but do n't bet that contractors ' unreported income will be detected that way . </s>
<s> The General Accounting Office estimates that 50 % of IRS audits do n't spot companies that fail to file the reports . </s>
<s> UH HUH : </s>
<s> A claim by Peter Testa of New York that a stranger paid him $ 500 to go into a bank and change $ 44,400 in small bills into large bills `` is unconvincing , '' the Tax Court found . </s>
<s> It held that Testa is taxable on $ 44,400 of unreported income . </s>
<s> WHY BE A MIDDLEMAN for charitable gifts ? a retiree asks . </s>
<s> A retired electrical engineer we 'll call Ben works part-time as a consultant , but he does n't want to earn so much that Social Security reduces his benefits . </s>
<s> So he has arranged for a university foundation to set up a scholarship fund for undergraduate engineering students . </s>
<s> He plans to tell clients to pay certain fees directly to the foundation instead of to him ; he would omit those fees from income reported on his return . </s>
<s> So he asked the IRS if the plan would work . </s>
<s> Well , notes IRS private ruling 8934014 , `` a fundamental principle '' is that income must be taxed to whoever earns it . </s>
<s> The rule goes back at least as far as a 1930 Supreme Court decision , Robert Willens of Shearson Lehman Hutton says . </s>
<s> If you assign your income to another , you still have controlled its disposition and enjoyed the fruits of your labor , even if indirectly . </s>
<s> Ben earns any fees sent directly to charity and is taxable on them , the IRS says ; of course , he also may take a charitable deduction for them . </s>
<s> BRIEFS : </s>
<s> Ways and Means veteran Gephardt -LRB- D. , Mo . -RRB- moves to the House Budget Committee ; Rep. Cardin -LRB- D. , Md . -RRB- replaces him ... . </s>
<s> Seattle 's license fees for adult peep shows vary from those for other coin-operated amusements without serving a substantial government interest and are unconstitutional , the ninth-circuit appeals court holds for Acorn Investments Inc . </s>
