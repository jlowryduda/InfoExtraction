<s> From the Sept. 30-Oct . 4 issue of The Economist : </s>
<s> What defeated General Aoun was not only the weight of the Syrian army . </s>
<s> The weight of Lebanon 's history was also against him ; and it is a history Israel is in danger of repeating . </s>
<s> Like Lebanon , and however unfairly , Israel is regarded by the Arab world as a colonial aberration . </s>
<s> Its best hope of acceptance by its neighbours lies in reaching a settlement with the Palestinians . </s>
<s> Like Lebanon , Israel is being remade by demography . </s>
<s> In Greater Israel more than half the children under six are Muslims . </s>
<s> Within 25 years Jews will probably be the minority . </s>
<s> Yet Israel will neither share power with all these Arabs nor , says its present prime minister , redraw its borders closer to its pre-1967 Jewish heartland . </s>
<s> By not choosing one of these options , Israelis will condemn themselves , as the Maronites did , to perpetual war with the Muslims in their midst , and so to the internal erosion of their state . </s>
<s> Unlike the Maronites , Israel 's Jews will not let themselves become the weakest force in a system of private armies ; Jerusalem will become Belfast before it becomes Beirut . </s>
<s> But that is not much of a consolation to draw from the failure of General Aoun . </s>
