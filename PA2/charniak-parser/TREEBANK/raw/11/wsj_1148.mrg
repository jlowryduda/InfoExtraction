<s> Mobil Corp. is preparing to slash the size of its work force in the U.S. , possibly as soon as next month , say individuals familiar with the company 's strategy . </s>
<s> The size of the cuts is n't known , but they 'll be centered in the exploration and production division , which is responsible for locating oil reserves , drilling wells and pumping crude oil and natural gas . </s>
<s> Employees have n't yet been notified . </s>
<s> Sources said that meetings to discuss the staff reductions have been scheduled for Friday at Mobil offices in New Orleans and Denver . </s>
<s> This would be a second round of cuts by Mobil , which along with other oil producers and refiners reduced its work force by 15 % to 20 % during the mid-1980s as part of an industrywide shakeout . </s>
<s> Mobil 's latest move could signal the beginning of further reductions by other oil companies in their domestic oil-producing operations . </s>
<s> In yesterday 's third-quarter earnings report , the company alluded to a $ 40 million provision for restructuring costs involving U.S. exploration and production operations . </s>
<s> The report says that `` the restructuring will take place over a two-year period and will principally involve the transfer and termination of employees in our U.S. operations . '' </s>
<s> A company spokesman , reached at his home last night , would only say that there will be a public announcement of the reduction program by the end of the week . </s>
<s> Most oil companies , including Mobil , have been reporting lower third-quarter earnings , largely as a result of lower earnings from chemicals as well as refining and marketing businesses . </s>
<s> Individuals familiar with Mobil 's strategy say that Mobil is reducing its U.S. work force because of declining U.S. output . </s>
<s> Yesterday , Mobil said domestic exploration and production operations had a $ 16 million loss in the third quarter , while comparable foreign operations earned $ 234 million . </s>
<s> Industrywide , oil production in this country fell by 500,000 barrels a day to 7.7 million barrels in the first eight months of this year . </s>
<s> Daily output is expected to decline by at least another 500,000 barrels next year . </s>
<s> Some Mobil executives were dismayed that a reference to the cutbacks was included in the earnings report before workers were notified . </s>
<s> One Mobil executive said that the $ 40 million charge related to the action indicates `` a substantial '' number of people will be involved . </s>
<s> Some will likely be offered severance packages while others will be transferred to overseas operations . </s>
