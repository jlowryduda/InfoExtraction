<s> Early this century , diamond mining in the magnificent dunes where the Namib Desert meets the Atlantic Ocean was a day at the beach . </s>
<s> Men would crawl in the sand looking for shiny stones . </s>
<s> It was as easy as collecting sea shells at Malibu . </s>
<s> Men are still combing the beach with shovels and hand brushes , searching for that unusual glint . </s>
<s> But only after a fleet of 336 gargantuan earthmoving vehicles belonging to De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. , the world 's diamond kingpins , do their work . </s>
<s> Last year , 43 million tons of desert were moved from one dune to another to recover 934,242 carats , which comes to 46 tons of sand per carat , or one-fifth gram . </s>
<s> Oh yes , the Atlantic was also pushed back 300 yards . </s>
<s> `` If there 's diamonds out there , we 'll get to them , '' says Les Johns , De Beers 's engineering manager . </s>
<s> Here , wedged between shifting dunes and pounding waves at the world 's most inhospitable diamond dig , lies the earth 's most precious jewel box . </s>
<s> Thanks to centuries of polishing by Mother Nature -- first in the gentle current of the Orange River that carried the stones from South Africa 's interior , then in the cold surf of the ocean , and finally in the coarse sands of the desert -- 98 % of the diamonds uncovered are of gem quality . </s>
<s> While other mines might yield more carats , a higher percentage of them go to industrial use . </s>
<s> Since this treasure chest is too big to fit in a bank vault , it has been turned into one . </s>
<s> Months after railway worker Zacharias Lewala first picked up a diamond from the sand in 1908 , the German colonialists who controlled Namibia proclaimed a wide swath of the desert -- about 200 miles north from the Orange River and 60 miles inland from the Atlantic -- a restricted area , a designation normally reserved for military operations . </s>
<s> When the Germans lost World War I , they lost Namibia to South Africa and the diamonds to Ernest Oppenheimer , patriarch of Anglo American Corp. and De Beers . </s>
<s> Today , no one gets in or out of the restricted area without De Beers 's stingy approval . </s>
<s> The mining zone has thus remained one of the most desolate places in Africa . </s>
<s> Ghost towns dot the Namib dunes , proving diamonds are n't forever . </s>
<s> Oranjemund , the mine headquarters , is a lonely corporate oasis of 9,000 residents . </s>
<s> Jackals roam the streets at night , and gemsbok , hardy antelope with long straight horns , wander in from the desert to drink from water sprinklers . </s>
<s> On most days , the desert 's heat and the cool of the ocean combine to create a mist like a damp rag . </s>
<s> The wind , stinging with sand , never seems to stop . </s>
<s> Still , miners from all parts of Namibia as well as professional staff from De Beers 's head offices in South Africa and London keep coming . </s>
<s> And Oranjemund boasts attractions besides diamonds . </s>
<s> There are six video rental shops , three restaurants , one cinema and 34 sports and recreation clubs for everything from cricket to lawn bowling . </s>
<s> The pride of Oranjemund is the 18-hole golf course -- with the largest sand trap in the world . </s>
<s> Last year , when the rising Orange River threatened to swamp the course , the same engineers who are pushing back the Atlantic rushed to build a wall to hold back the flood . </s>
<s> `` Nothing is too good for our golf course , '' says Tony George , a mining engineer . </s>
<s> Despite fears the mine may be partially nationalized by the new Namibian government following next month 's elections freeing the country from South African control , De Beers engineers are working to extend the mine 's productive life for another 25 years , from the current estimate of 10 . </s>
<s> Huge machines that look as though they came from the Star Wars desert-battle scene lumber among the dunes . </s>
<s> Mechanized vacuum cleaners probe the sand like giant anteaters ; a whirring ferris wheellike excavator , with buckets instead of seats , chews through layers of compacted sand ; tracks and conveyor belts , shuttling sand to the screening plants , criss-cross the beach . </s>
<s> Then there is the artifical sea wall , 600 yards long and 60 yards thick , jutting into the ocean . </s>
<s> Made of sand , it receives around-the-clock maintainence against the battering waves . </s>
<s> When the mining in front of the wall is complete , it is moved northward . </s>
<s> A companion jetty that helps hold back the sea looks like a rusting junkyard . </s>
<s> Engineers first used concrete blocks to bolster the barrier , but the ocean tossed them aside like driftwood . </s>
<s> Then someone decided to try broken-down earthmoving equipment that , inexplicably , held against the waves . </s>
<s> `` The Caterpillar people are n't too happy when they see their equipment used like that , '' shrugs Mr. George . </s>
<s> `` They figure it 's not a very good advert . '' </s>
<s> Despite all these innovations , most of the diamonds are still found in the sand swept away by the men wielding shovels and brushes -- the ignominiously named `` bedrock sweepers '' who toil in the wake of the excavators . </s>
<s> Laboring in blue and gray overalls , they are supposed to concentrate on cleaning out crevices , and not strain their eyes looking for diamonds . </s>
<s> But should they spy one , the company will pay a bonus equal to one-third its value . </s>
<s> For these workers at the bottom of the mine 's pay scale , this is usually enough to overcome the temptation to steal -- a crime that could earn them up to 15 years in jail . </s>
<s> Still , employees do occasionally try to smuggle out a gem or two . </s>
<s> One man wrapped several diamonds in the knot of his tie . </s>
<s> Another poked a hole in the heel of his shoe . </s>
<s> A food caterer stashed stones in the false bottom of a milk pail . </s>
<s> None made it past the body searches and X-rays of mine security . </s>
