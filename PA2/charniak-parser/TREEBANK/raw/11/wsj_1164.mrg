<s> -LRB- During its centennial year , The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history . -RRB- </s>
<s> MORGAN STANLEY , THE ONCE STODGY investment house , in 1974 helped a corporate client complete a hostile takeover . </s>
<s> It was the start of a boom in unfriendly , even ungentlemanly , mergers . </s>
<s> On July 18 , 1974 , International Nickle of Canada -- advised by Morgan -- offered $ 28 a share , equal to $ 157 million , for ESB , a Philadelphia battery maker . </s>
<s> ESB said it was given only a three-hour advance warning on a `` take it or leave it '' basis from Inco , as the Toronto company is called . </s>
<s> `` ESB is aware that a hostile tender offer is being made by a foreign company for all of ESB 's shares , '' said F.J. Port , ESB 's president . </s>
<s> `` Hostile '' thus entered the merger-acquisition lexicon . </s>
<s> Joseph Flom , of Skadden , Arps , Slote , Meagher & Flom , which became a leading legal firm in merger cases , said the case `` made takeovers respectable . '' </s>
<s> ESB spurned Inco and within five days ESB had a `` white knight '' as United Aircraft -- headed by Harry Gray , a shrewdly friendly acquirer of companies -- offered $ 34 a share . </s>
<s> Gray was advised by Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch . </s>
<s> ESB directors warmly accepted , but a whirlwind bidding match ensued . </s>
<s> Within a few days in July , Inco raised its bid to $ 36 and United matched it . </s>
<s> On a single day Inco lifted its offer to $ 38 and then to $ 41 , equal to $ 225.5 million . </s>
<s> United met the $ 38 but then withdrew . </s>
<s> ESB on July 29 accepted the Inco offer and the brief battle -- unlike the intricate and lengthy big takeovers of 1984-1989 -- was over . </s>
<s> The new gritty game became a money maker for Wall Street 's once austere old-name houses . </s>
<s> Inco paid Morgan an advisory fee of about $ 250,000 , a paltry figure by today 's measures . </s>
<s> Early this year Morgan and three other investment houses each received $ 25 million in advisory fees from Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts in its $ 25 billion friendly buy-out of RJR Nabisco . </s>
