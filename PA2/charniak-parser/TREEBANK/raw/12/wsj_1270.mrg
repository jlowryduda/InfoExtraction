<s> but worries about 1990 . </s>
<s> With most legislatures adjourned for the year , small business is tallying its scorecard . </s>
<s> Much of its attention was spent fighting organized labor 's initiatives on issues the small-business community traditionally opposes -- from raising state minimum wage levels to mandating benefits in health plans . </s>
<s> While results were mixed in many states , `` small business got by fairly well , '' concludes Don L. Robinson , associate director of the National Federation of Independent Business , the largest small-business organization . </s>
<s> Five states -- Oregon , Rhode Island , New Hampshire , Iowa and Wisconsin -- passed bills to boost the minimum wage , but measures in 19 other states were defeated . </s>
<s> Oregon 's rate will rise to $ 4.75 an hour , the nation 's highest , in Jan. 1 , 1991 . </s>
<s> Iowa 's will be the second highest -- at $ 4.65 an hour in January 1992 -- but small-business lobbyists won an exclusion for tiny concerns and a lower training rate . </s>
<s> In 17 central states , one small-business count shows lawmakers adopted only three of 46 bills mandating health coverage or parental leave . </s>
<s> The Illinois Legislature narrowly passed a parental-leave bill , which Gov. James Thompson vetoed , and Iowa and Tennessee amended laws to require that employers pay for breast-cancer exams . </s>
<s> Small business is bracing for an avalanche of similar proposals next year . </s>
<s> `` Those kinds of issues always keep coming back , '' says Robert Beckwith , who manages the Illinois Chamber of Commerce 's small-business office . </s>
<s> DESPITE VICTORIES this year , small business fears losing parental-leave war . </s>
<s> Only two states -- Vermont and Washington -- this year joined five others requiring private employers to grant leaves of absence to employees with newborn or adopted infants . </s>
<s> Similar proposals were defeated in at least 15 other states . </s>
<s> But small business , which generally detests government-mandated benefits , has taken note of the growing number of close votes . </s>
<s> `` It 's just a matter of time before the tide turns , '' says one Midwestern lobbyist . </s>
<s> Consequently , small business is taking more `` pro-active '' steps to counter mandated leaves . </s>
<s> In Pennsylvania , small businesses are pushing for a voluntary alternative ; they favor a commission that would develop sample leave policies that employers could adopt . </s>
<s> They also support a tax credit for employers to offset the cost of hiring and training workers who temporarily replace employees on parental leave . </s>
<s> In 1990 , the issue is expected to be especially close in Alaska , California , Michigan , New York , Pennsylvania and Illinois . </s>
<s> `` We 'll be playing a lot of defense , especially in the Midwest and Northeast , '' says Jim Buente of the NFIB . </s>
<s> IN LOS ANGELES , more small businesses ponder adopting a child-care policy . </s>
<s> Triggering the re-examination is a recent city council decision to give preference in letting city contracts to suppliers with a stated policy on child care for their employees . </s>
<s> The preferential treatment even applies to awarding small contracts under $ 25,000 and consulting and temporary services -- which often go to the smaller concerns . </s>
<s> Firms are permitted wide flexibility in the child-care arrangements they provide . </s>
<s> Council member Joy Picus , the measure 's chief advocate , considers it part of a `` pro-family policy '' that makes Los Angeles a leader in `` humanizing the workplace . '' </s>
<s> NOVEMBER BALLOTS will contain few referendum or initiative issues that especially affect small business . </s>
<s> In San Francisco , small businesses are urging passage of a local initiative to build a new $ 95 million downtown baseball stadium ; they believe it will spur retail sales and hotel-restaurant business . </s>
<s> But in Washington state , small business generally opposes an initiative to boost spending on children 's programs by $ 360 million , fearing the state 's 7.8 % sales tax will be raised to finance the outlays . </s>
<s> DIALING DOLLARS : </s>
<s> Small businesses in suburban Chicago are discovering that an area-code switch Nov. 11 -- to 708 from the familiar 312 -- wo n't be without some costs as they alter stationery , among other things , and notify customers . </s>
<s> Wessels & Pautsch , a small St. Charles law firm , plans to mail 500 customers a list of its lawyers ' new phone and fax numbers as well as updated Rolodex cards . </s>
<s> But many owners plan to practice frugality -- crossing out the old code and writing in the new one until their stock runs out . </s>
<s> Even print-shop operator Clay Smith of Naperville wo n't discard his old supply . </s>
<s> -LRB- He reports his business is up slightly from customers replacing old stock . -RRB- </s>
<s> CALIFORNIA , A TREND-SETTER in franchising rules , stirs a controversy . </s>
<s> With some new rules , state officials say they made it easier -- and faster -- to sell new franchises whose terms stray from those in state-registered contracts . </s>
<s> Previously , regulators insisted that franchisers pre-register such changes with the state -- a costly process taking at least six weeks . </s>
<s> Now some negotiated sales that meet a series of tests do n't have to be pre-registered . </s>
<s> For instance , franchisers no longer must pre-register sales to aspiring franchisees who qualify as `` sophisticated purchasers . '' </s>
<s> Such buyers must have a minimum net worth of $ 1 million , $ 200,000 annual income , or recent experience in the business area of the franchise being sold . </s>
<s> But critics consider the changes regressive . </s>
<s> Lewis G. Rudnick , a Chicago lawyer who represents franchisers , contends California is narrowly limiting -- rather than expanding -- opportunities for negotiating sales . </s>
<s> He argues California regulators historically have misinterpreted their law -- and he says negotiated sales that are n't pre-registered have been legal all along . </s>
<s> San Francisco lawyer Timothy H. Fine , who represents franchisees , insists California 's cautiousness helps protect franchisees from crafty sales negotiators who push unlawful clauses . </s>
<s> SMALL TALK : </s>
<s> A new Maryland law frees store owners of liability if a customer trips or otherwise gets hurt on the way to the restroom ... . </s>
<s> Only 4 % of Missouri small businesses surveyed say they 've tested an employee or applicant for drug or alcohol use ... . </s>
<s> By 52%-36 % , Tennessee NFIB members favor laws to limit foreign ownership of land and facilities in the state . </s>
