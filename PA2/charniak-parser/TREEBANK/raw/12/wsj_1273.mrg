<s> Reaching for that extra bit of yield can be a big mistake -- especially if you do n't understand what you 're investing in . </s>
<s> Just ask Richard Blumenfeld , a New Jersey dentist who considers himself `` a reasonably sophisticated investor . '' </s>
<s> In May 1986 , Dr. Blumenfeld gave Merrill Lynch & Co. about $ 40,000 for a federally insured certificate of deposit offering an effective yield of more than 9 % . </s>
<s> `` It was a time when interest rates came down very rapidly , '' Dr. Blumenfeld recalls . </s>
<s> Yields on five-year CDs at major banks were averaging about 7.45 % , and 10-year Treasury notes were paying less than 8 % . </s>
<s> The CD seemed like a great deal . </s>
<s> But nearly 3 1\/2 years later , Merrill says the investment is worth about $ 43,000 -- an amount that represents an annual return of just over 2 % on Dr. Blumenfeld 's $ 40,000 . </s>
<s> The problem is that the CD he bought for a retirement plan was n't a plain vanilla CD . </s>
<s> Instead , his Merrill broker put him in a zero-coupon CD , which is sold at a deep discount to its face value . </s>
<s> The difference between the price and the face value payable at maturity is the investor 's return . </s>
<s> More important , the CD was purchased on the secondary , or resale , market . </s>
<s> Because the CD had an effective yield of 13.4 % when it was issued in 1984 , and interest rates in general had declined sharply since then , part of the price Dr. Blumenfeld paid was a premium -- an additional amount on top of the CD 's base value plus accrued interest that represented the CD 's increased market value . </s>
<s> Now the thrift that issued the CD is insolvent , and Dr. Blumenfeld has learned to his surprise that the premium is n't insured under federal deposit insurance . </s>
<s> The tip-off came when he opened a recent Merrill Lynch statement and found that the CD 's `` estimated current market value '' had plummeted by $ 9,000 in a month . </s>
<s> Several phone calls and a visit to his broker 's office later , the dentist found out that the $ 9,000 drop represented the current value of the premium he paid when he bought the CD , and that the amount was n't insured . </s>
<s> `` This is one thing I was never aware of , '' he says . </s>
<s> He assumed that principal and interest were `` fully insured up to $ 100,000 , '' he adds . </s>
<s> Dr. Blumenfeld is n't unique . </s>
<s> Especially at times like these , when declining rates make it hard for investors to get yields they have come to expect , too many people chase the promise of above-market returns without fully appreciating the risk . </s>
<s> `` Yield greed often gets in the way of understanding things , '' says John Markese , research director of the American Association of Individual Investors , a Chicago-based educational group . </s>
<s> `` The biggest problem we have is that investors realize , after the fact , that they did n't understand what they were investing in . '' </s>
<s> Dr. Blumenfeld concedes he did n't fully understand what he was buying . </s>
<s> He says that he knew he was getting a zero-coupon CD and that he had previously invested in TIGRs -LRB- Treasury Income Growth Receipts -RRB- , a type of zero-coupon Treasury security sold by Merrill Lynch . </s>
<s> But he says he did n't understand he was buying the CD on the secondary market , and he contends his broker never fully explained the risks . </s>
<s> The broker , Thomas Beairsto of Merrill Lynch 's Morristown , N.J. , office , refuses to discuss the matter with a reporter , referring inquiries to Merrill Lynch officials in New York . </s>
<s> Those officials say there was full disclosure of the risks in a `` fact sheet '' sent to all CD investors with their confirmation of sale . </s>
<s> The fact sheet , dated April 1986 , says on page three : `` If the price paid for a CD purchased in the secondary market ... is higher than the accreted value in the case of zero-coupon CDs , the difference ... is not insured ... . </s>
<s> Computations involving zero-coupon CDs are more complicated and you should discuss any questions you may have with your financial consultant . '' </s>
<s> Dr. Blumenfeld says he does n't remember the paragraph about premiums in the fact sheet he received and did n't realize part of what he paid was a premium . </s>
<s> `` I assumed I was buying a CD as a CD , '' he says . </s>
<s> Nevertheless , Merrill Lynch has agreed that if the thrift that issued Dr. Blumenfeld 's CD , Peoples Heritage Federal Savings & Loan Association in Salina , Kan. , is liquidated and the CD terminated , the brokerage firm would cover the premium Dr. Blumenfeld paid . </s>
<s> -LRB- Federal deposit insurance would pay principal and interest accrued to the date of liquidation , to a maximum of $ 100,000 . -RRB- </s>
<s> `` It 's not a blanket commitment , it 's a case-by-case situation , '' says Albert Disposti , a managing director of Merrill Lynch Money Markets Inc . </s>
<s> `` There 's a question whether brokers at the time were fully aware '' of the risks . </s>
<s> `` We were n't sure that full disclosure , as we wanted it , was being made . '' </s>
<s> Merrill Lynch says it 's impossible to estimate how many investors are in Dr. Blumenfeld 's situation , although it says the firm has received only one other complaint about premiums on the secondary market in three years . </s>
<s> Merrill Lynch now provides credit rating information about the institutions whose CDs it sells , which it did n't provide in 1986 . </s>
<s> Zero-coupon CDs are only a small portion of the $ 1 trillion-plus in CDs outstanding , and those purchased on the secondary market are an even smaller part of the total . </s>
<s> Merrill Lynch estimates that fewer than 10 financial institutions currently issue zero-coupon CDs . </s>
<s> Still , there are several billion dollars of zero-coupon CDs with various maturities outstanding . </s>
<s> Because of the tax consequences of zero-coupon investments -- income tax is payable in the year interest is accrued , although interest is n't actually paid until maturity -- zero-coupon CDs are usually sold for tax-advantaged accounts to finance things like retirement and children 's education . </s>
<s> Most zero-coupon CDs are in maturities of six to nine years , and they usually double in value by maturity . </s>
<s> But investors who bought zero-coupon CDs in the secondary market are n't the only ones who may be surprised to learn the full amount of their investments is n't insured . </s>
<s> People who paid a premium for standard CDs purchased on the secondary market could also find that those premiums are n't insured if the institutions that issued the CDs failed . </s>
<s> However , those premiums are usually far smaller than on zero-coupon CDs , and the simpler pricing structure of a standard CD makes it more apparent when a premium is paid . </s>
<s> Whatever the case , a Merrill Lynch spokesman emphasizes , investors should n't have to worry about the uninsured premium issue , unless the bank or thrift that issued the CD is closed and its deposits paid off before maturity or transferred to another institution at a lower rate . </s>
<s> Dr. Blumenfeld says he 's satisfied that his problem has been resolved . </s>
<s> And he says he 's learned a lesson : `` You always have to watch out for yourself . </s>
<s> No one else will watch out for you . </s>
