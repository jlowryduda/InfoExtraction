<s> At least 10 states are resisting Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 's nationwide effort to settle its legal troubles , and some might instead try to revoke the firm 's license to sell securities within their borders . </s>
<s> The reluctance of some states to let Drexel off the hook could hamper the firm 's attempts to polish its image after its guilty plea to six felonies last month , say several people familiar with the discussions . </s>
<s> Up to now , Drexel has made a rapid-fire series of settlements with 25 states and the commonwealth of Puerto Rico . </s>
<s> Just yesterday , New Hampshire announced it made a $ 75,000 settlement with Drexel , a record-tying fine for a securities-law matter in that state . </s>
<s> These states have been entering into settlements with Drexel as part of the firm 's efforts to operate freely anywhere in the U.S. despite its record as an admitted felon . </s>
<s> But individuals familiar with the generally successful Drexel talks say the firm is meeting resistance from some big states , including New Jersey , New York , California , Pennsylvania , Connecticut and Missouri . </s>
<s> Officials in some of these states say they do n't want to simply accept the settlements offered by Drexel . </s>
<s> They question if Drexel is getting easier treatment than the many small penny-stock firms whose brokerage licenses are routinely revoked . </s>
<s> Drexel has to settle with state securities regulators in the wake of its criminal guilty plea and a related civil settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that includes payment of $ 650 million in penalties . </s>
<s> These stem from a two-year federal investigation of insider trading and securities fraud on Wall Street . </s>
<s> Ohio , the District of Columbia , Tennessee and Illinois have been less resistant to Drexel than the other six states , but nonetheless have refused to settle so far , say those familiar with the discussions . </s>
<s> Drexel says it does n't expect any of its state brokerage licenses will be revoked , and even if some are , its securities business would n't be directly hurt . </s>
<s> It already has sold its retail , or individual-investor , brokerage network ; securities firms do n't need brokerage licenses for non-retail activities such as investment banking . </s>
<s> Still , if nothing else , a revoked brokerage license could be a burden because it must be disclosed in many of the transactions in which Drexel could be involved . </s>
<s> Securities regulators praise Drexel for its energetic effort , led by government-approved general counsel Saul S. Cohen , to settle its legal problems with the states . </s>
<s> But they disagree about the message these settlements give to the public . </s>
<s> `` There was a lot of internal debate about that specific issue , '' said Susan Bryant , Oklahoma 's chief securities regulator and president of the North American Securities Administrators Association , which drafted a voluntary settlement plan for the states with Drexel . </s>
<s> The question , she said , is whether Drexel should be allowed to pay and move on , or `` whether you should -LRB- simply -RRB- revoke the license when someone is convicted of a felony . '' </s>
<s> While Ms. Bryant 's state went ahead and accepted Drexel 's settlement offer of $ 25,000 , she said : `` I do n't have any argument with those who came to different conclusions . </s>
<s> I can see both sides . '' </s>
<s> Similarly , Alfred Rubega , New Hampshire 's director of securities regulation , said his state had n't received any complaints about Drexel , so it really could n't press the issue . </s>
<s> Still , `` I understand the reasons '' that other states are holding out , he said . </s>
<s> Mr. Cohen , the Drexel general counsel , said , `` I do n't think , as we say in investment banking , that ` by the end of the day ' we 'll be losing any licenses . '' </s>
<s> Asked about states that are taking a hard line , he said , `` There are states that have asked for additional information , which we are providing to them . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Cohen said more than $ 2.8 million has been paid to 26 states and that Drexel still expects to pay out a total of $ 11.5 million . </s>
<s> By the end of this week , Drexel should have another three to four settlements , Mr. Cohen said . </s>
<s> `` The rate we 're going , I think that by the end of the month , we 're looking to have a total of 30 to 35 , '' he said . </s>
<s> That total would be important for Drexel . </s>
<s> The investment bank has previously announced that as part of its punishment it would create an independent foundation to promote ethical behavior in the securities industry . </s>
<s> A proviso to that promise is that a minimum of 35 states reach settlement agreements before next Tuesday . </s>
<s> There are , according to several securities commissioners , at least 16 states that are either close to settlements with Drexel or who do n't appear opposed to settling . </s>
<s> Drexel 's proposed state fines have been based on a state 's population and on the size of Drexel 's business in the state . </s>
<s> New Jersey , for example , was asked to accept $ 300,000 , but refused . </s>
<s> The state is n't ruling out revoking Drexel 's brokerage license . </s>
<s> The state can also bar Drexel as an investment adviser . </s>
<s> State officials wo n't describe their position in detail , but James McLelland Smith , state securities chief , said : `` We really are still looking at it and have informed -LRB- Drexel -RRB- that the proposal is really not sufficient for settlement . '' </s>
<s> Connecticut already has issued a `` notice of intent '' to revoke Drexel 's brokerage license . </s>
<s> It is one of the states that have met with Mr. Cohen and asked for additional information about investors ' accounts and other matters . </s>
<s> `` This particular issue goes to the very integrity of the capital-formation market , '' state Banking Commissioner Howard Brown said . </s>
<s> A banking department spokesman added : `` Commissioner Brown does n't feel that money alone is the issue here . '' </s>
<s> Particularly touchy are the cases of New York , which is Drexel 's base , and California , the base of Drexel 's highly profitable junk-bond operation that led to the firm 's legal difficulties . </s>
<s> Neither state has settled , and officials in the two states wo n't discuss their reasons for not doing so . </s>
<s> But Drexel has made it clear it could mount a significant legal battle in each state if its license is revoked , according to state officials . </s>
<s> Ms. Bryant , the head of the state securities group , said Drexel has done a better job of settling with the states than E.F. Hutton did after its guilty plea to a massive check-kiting scheme several years ago . </s>
<s> Still , she said , Drexel 's trouble with some states is n't a bad thing . </s>
<s> `` This process should point out that it 's not going to be easy for a firm that 's convicted of a felony to immediately jump back into the retail business , '' Ms. Bryant said . </s>
<s> `` We need to have somebody worried so they do n't do this again . '' </s>
<s> These are the 26 states , including the commonwealth of Puerto Rico , that have settled with Drexel : Alaska , Arkansas , Delaware , Georgia , Hawaii , Idaho , Indiana , Iowa , Kansas , Kentucky , Maine , Maryland , Minnesota , Mississippi , New Hampshire , New Mexico , North Dakota , Oklahoma , Oregon , South Carolina , South Dakota , Utah , Vermont , Washington , Wyoming and Puerto Rico . </s>
