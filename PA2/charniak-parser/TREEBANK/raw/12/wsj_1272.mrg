<s> Garry Kasparov went to combat Sunday with the world 's most advanced chess computer and kicked it around -- symbolically , anyway -- like an old tin can . </s>
<s> Playing black in the first game , the human champion maneuvered Deep Thought , known for its attacking prowess , into a totally passive position . </s>
<s> Then he unleashed his own , unstoppable , attack . </s>
<s> And in the second game , with Mr. Kasparov advancing ferociously as white , D.T. offered feeble resistance and lost even faster . </s>
<s> Well , mankind can rest easier for now . </s>
<s> Though almost everybody at the playing site had been looking for the 26-year-old Soviet to beat the Pennsylvania-based computer , he gave the machine a far worse drubbing than many expected . </s>
<s> And when Mr. Kasparov strode into the playing hall , he called the outcome . </s>
<s> As if he were Iron Mike , about to enter the ring with a 98-pound weakling , he declared : `` I 'll be able to beat any computer for the next five years . '' </s>
<s> His strategy against D.T. was based on a thorough study of dozens of its games , he said , including its notorious whippings of the grandmasters Bent Larsen of Denmark and Robert Byrne of the U.S. . </s>
<s> Mr. Kasparov was underwhelmed . </s>
<s> `` The computer 's mind is too straight , too primitive , '' lacking the intuition and creativity needed to reach the top , he said . </s>
<s> The champion apparently was not worried at all about D.T. 's strong points . </s>
<s> Its chief builder , Taiwan-born Feng-hsiung Hsu , nicknamed his brainchild `` the Weasel '' for its tactical flair at wriggling out of horrible positions . </s>
<s> D.T. also has a prodigious and flawless memory , is utterly fearless , and could n't be distracted by the sexy nude sculptures spread around the playing hall , in the New York Academy of Art . </s>
<s> In fact , D.T. never left home , Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh , but communicated with its human handlers by telephone link . </s>
<s> They conceded that the odds favored Mr. Kasparov , but they put their hope in D.T. 's recently enhanced capacity for examining positions -- up to a million per second , from 720,000 . </s>
<s> But the handlers mistakenly stuck with silicon chips ; they needed kryptonite . </s>
<s> This became apparent as game one , a Sicilian Defense by Mr. Kasparov , proceeded . </s>
<s> No human can examine millions of moves , but Mr. Kasparov , using his ineffably powerful brain , consistently found very good ones . </s>
<s> After eight moves by each side , the board was the same as in a game in which Nigel Short of Great Britain fought the champion to a draw in 1980 . </s>
<s> But the computer did n't play Mr. Short 's ninth move , a key pawn thrust , and its position deteriorated rapidly . </s>
<s> Instead of castling , a standard measure to safeguard the king , D.T. made a second-rate rook maneuver at move 13 ; then it put a knight offside on move 16 . </s>
<s> `` Only two classes of minds would think of this -- very weak human players , and computers , '' said Edmar Mednis , the expert commentator for the match , which was attended by hundreds of chess fans . </s>
<s> By move 21 , D.T. had fallen into a deep positional trap . </s>
<s> It allowed Mr. Kasparov to exchange his dark-squared bishop for one of D.T. 's knights . </s>
<s> Bishops usually are worth slightly more than knights , but in this case Mr. Kasparov was left with a very dangerous knight and D.T. 's surviving bishop was reduced to passivity . </s>
<s> Indeed , it looked more like a pawn , a `` tall pawn , '' as spectators snidely put it . </s>
<s> Consistently , D.T. was over-optimistic about its chances , which it continually sized up , in numerical form . </s>
<s> When most spectators thought its position hopeless , the computer thought it was only , in effect , one-half of a pawn down . </s>
<s> Such evaluations met with derision , and kept the machine from resigning as soon as humans would have -- prompting more derision . </s>
<s> While D.T. shuffled its king back and forth in a defensive crouch , Mr. Kasparov maneuvered the knight to a dominant outpost . </s>
<s> He also launched a kingside storm , sacrificing a pawn to denude D.T. 's king . </s>
<s> No amount of weasling could have saved this game for D.T . </s>
<s> A piece down , the computer resigned . </s>
<s> Now , with the crowd in the analysis room smelling figurative blood , the only question seemed to be how fast Mr. Kasparov could win game two . </s>
<s> With the advantage of playing white -LRB- which moves first -RRB- , Mr. Kasparov followed up cleverly against the computer 's defense , a Queen 's Gambit Accepted . </s>
<s> As early as move six , Mr. Kasparov deviated from a well-known sequence of moves , developing a knight instead of making a standard bishop attack against the computer 's advanced knight . </s>
<s> This left the computer with a broader range of plausible replies -- and it immediately blundered by moving a queenside pawn , to the neglect of kingside development . </s>
<s> `` In a new position just after the opening , a computer will have serious problems , '' Mr. Kasparov said later . </s>
<s> In such positions , he explained , `` you have to create something new , and the computer is n't able to do that right now . '' </s>
<s> After only 11 moves for each side , the computer 's position was shaky . </s>
<s> Greedily , it grabbed a pawn , at the cost of facing a brutal attack . </s>
<s> And when a defensive move was called for , D.T. passed up an obvious pawn move and instead exposed its queen to immediate tactical threats . </s>
<s> Mr. Kasparov remarked later that `` even a weak club player '' would have avoided the queen move . </s>
<s> Now , after only a dozen moves , spectators were looking for a mating combination . </s>
<s> On a demonstration board , emcee Shelby Lyman showed a quick kill initiated by a knight sacrifice ; no spectator refuted this line of play . </s>
<s> Mr. Kasparov 's continuation was slower but , in the end , just as deadly . </s>
<s> He won D.T. 's queen for two minor pieces and two pawns -- not enough compensation , in this position , to give the computer much hope . </s>
<s> In a hopeless position , the computer resigned rather than make its 37th move . </s>
<s> And Mr. Kasparov , to cheers and applause , marched back into the analysis room . </s>
<s> `` In both games I got exactly what I wanted , '' he said . </s>
<s> What he had demonstrated , he added , is that there 's more to chess than sheer calculation . </s>
<s> Undeterred , D.T. 's handlers vowed to press on . </s>
<s> Indeed , three of them will be building a successor machine for International Business Machines Corp . </s>
<s> Promises Feng-hsiung Hsu : `` In three years we 'll mount a better challenge . '' </s>
