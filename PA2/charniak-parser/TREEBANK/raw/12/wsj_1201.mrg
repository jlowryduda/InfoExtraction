<s> Stock of United Airlines parent UAL Corp. gyrated wildly yesterday amid speculation that one or more investors may challenge the UAL board 's decision to remain independent instead of pursuing a buy-out or other transaction . </s>
<s> The board 's decision , announced after the market closed Monday , initially prompted a severe sell-off in UAL shares , which at midday traded as low as $ 145 a share , down $ 33 a share , in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange . </s>
<s> The deepening bloodbath for takeover-stock traders , who by then had seen UAL stock tumble 49 % since Oct. 12 , also triggered a marketwide sell-off that sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average down more than 80 points at 10:40 a.m . </s>
<s> But then steady , concentrated buying by Bear , Stearns & Co. , which frequently buys stock for corporate raiders , took hold and steadied the fall in UAL , which eventually buoyed the entire market . </s>
<s> The industrial average closed down only 3.69 points at 2659.22 . </s>
<s> Late in the afternoon , several big purchases by Bear , Stearns , particularly a block of 200,000 shares at 2:43 p.m. at $ 150 a share , triggered a buying spree that took UAL up more than 18 points in the final hour of trading . </s>
<s> UAL stock closed at $ 170 a share , down $ 8.375 . </s>
<s> Volume was a tumultuous 4.9 million shares , or 22 % of the 21.8 million UAL shares outstanding . </s>
<s> Traders estimated that Bear , Stearns bought more than 1 million shares . </s>
<s> The two most frequently rumored buyers , neither of whom would comment , were Coniston Partners , which battled the UAL board in 1987 , and New York real estate developer Donald Trump , who recently made and withdrew an offer for American Airlines parent AMR Corp . </s>
<s> However , one person familiar with UAL said the signs pointed to Coniston because Mr. Trump has n't asked for permission to buy more than $ 15 million of stock under federal antitrust rules . </s>
<s> Takeover-stock traders , stung by their huge losses in UAL stock , remained eager for some action by an outside catalyst following the collapse Oct. 13 of a $ 300-a-share , $ 6.79 billion labor-management buy-out . </s>
<s> Their hope was that the catalyst would seek to oust the board in a solicitation of shareholder consents . </s>
<s> Baker , Nye Investments , a New York takeover-stock trader that owns UAL stock , would n't comment on reports the firm is considering seeking such a shareholder vote . </s>
<s> But partner Richard Nye said , `` This is the most extraordinary failed transaction I 've seen in 25 years in this business . </s>
<s> It would make sense for somebody to do it . </s>
<s> I have never seen a case of incompetence shared by so many participants . '' </s>
<s> In 1986 , Baker , Nye waged a proxy fight for control of Leaseway Transportation Inc. that ultimately led to Leaseway 's being sold . </s>
<s> Some traders pointed hopefully to earlier estimates by UAL 's investment adviser , First Boston Corp. , that recapitalizations could yield $ 245 to $ 280 a share . </s>
<s> But those would require pilots ' cooperation . </s>
<s> Any investor who acquires UAL stock in an attempt to force a buy-out or recapitalization must deal with United 's contentious unions . </s>
<s> The pilots are working under an expired contract , and the machinists contract expires next month . </s>
<s> That gives them enormous leverage , including the threat of a strike to block any buy-out or recapitalization attempt they oppose . </s>
<s> However , a catalyst like Coniston could seek shareholder support for a sale to a labor-management group at the last price discussed by that group before the board meeting Monday . </s>
<s> The pilots had been working on a buy-out bid between $ 225 and $ 240 a share , or $ 5.09 billion to $ 5.42 billion . </s>
<s> One person familiar with UAL said the unsettled labor situation and the uncertain world-wide financial markets contributed to the board 's decision to avoid `` rushing around selling the company at a bargain price , '' particularly since it accepted a $ 300-a-share offer just last month . </s>
<s> Even some takeover-stock traders said they could n't quarrel with the board 's logic . </s>
<s> But the board 's decision prompted many to bail out of the stock yesterday . </s>
<s> `` We had a lot of people who threw in the towel today , '' said Earl Ellis , a partner in Benjamin Jacobson & Sons , a specialist in trading UAL stock on the Big Board . </s>
<s> Another trader noted that many arbitrage firms are afraid to sell their UAL stock at the bottom , but already own so much they ca n't buy any more . </s>
<s> `` This deal is like a Roach Motel , '' he said . </s>
<s> `` They check in , but they ca n't check out . '' </s>
<s> But both the traders and the pilots remain interested in some transaction . </s>
<s> So too , according to many reports , is British Airways PLC , despite its public withdrawal from the buy-out . </s>
<s> The pilots might end up teaming up with their longtime adversaries , the machinists union , in a recapitalization . </s>
<s> The machinists are reviewing proposals they made in the past for recapitalizations that would pay a special shareholder dividend and give employees a minority stake . </s>
<s> The company rejected those past proposals . </s>
<s> It is unclear , however , if the machinists would support a majority stake , as the pilots want . </s>
<s> A machinist official said that would depend on how much in concessions machinists would have to give in return for the majority stake . </s>
<s> Some investors whose names were bandied about by traders as potential UAL stock buyers said they were n't buying . </s>
<s> `` I 'm not interested , '' said Dallas investor Harold Simmons . </s>
<s> A source close to Carl Icahn , a corporate raider who owns Trans World Airlines Inc. , said he has n't owned any UAL stock and is n't buying . </s>
<s> One person familiar with Texas billionaire Robert Bass said he is n't likely to make any hostile moves . </s>
<s> And a spokesman for Reliance Group Holdings Inc. , which had held 7 % of UAL before the first buy-out bid but later reduced its holdings below 5 % , would n't comment . </s>
<s> Marvin Davis , whose $ 5.4 billion takeover bid originally put the nation 's second-largest airline in play , is limited by a standstill agreement with UAL he signed in September . </s>
<s> The Los Angeles investor ca n't buy UAL stock , solicit shareholder consents or make a new offer unless he makes a formal offer of $ 300 a share or UAL accepts an offer below $ 300 . </s>
<s> However , Mr. Davis could pressure the board by asking that the agreement be waived , or letting it be known that he has financing for an offer at a lower price . </s>
