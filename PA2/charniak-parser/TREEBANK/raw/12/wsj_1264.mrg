<s> Magazine publishers are facing spiraling costs and a glut of new titles . </s>
<s> But even a raft of recent failures is n't stopping them from launching new publications . </s>
<s> At the American Magazine Conference here , publishers are plenty worried about the industry 's woes . </s>
<s> But they are also talking about new magazines . </s>
<s> For example , Toronto-based Telemedia Inc. will publish Eating Well , a new food and health magazine due out next summer . </s>
<s> New York-based Hearst Corp. this fall plans to publish its first issue of 9 Months , a magazine for expectant mothers , and has already launched American Home . </s>
<s> And Time Warner Inc. is developing a spinoff of Time magazine aimed at kids , on the heels of its successful Sports Illustrated for Kids . </s>
<s> Over the past four years , the number of consumer magazines has increased by an average of 80 magazines annually , according to Donald Kummerfeld , president of the Magazine Publishers of America . </s>
<s> `` This is an impressive show of faith in the future of the magazine industry , '' said Mr. Kummerfeld . </s>
<s> `` Entrepreneurs do n't rush to get into a stagnant or declining industry . '' </s>
<s> And despite the recent tough advertising climate , industry figures released at the meeting here indicate things may be turning around . </s>
<s> For the first nine months , advertising pages in consumer magazines tracked by the Publishers Information Bureau increased 4 % from the same period last year , to 125,849 pages . </s>
<s> Total magazine ad revenue for the same period increased 12 % to $ 4.6 billion . </s>
<s> Though for some magazines categories a tough advertising climate persists , the industry in general is doing well compared with the newspaper industry . </s>
<s> Though some magazines are thriving , the magazine publishing industry remains a risky business . </s>
<s> Within the same nine months , News Corp. closed down In Fashion , a once-promising young woman 's fashion magazine , Drake Publications Inc. has folded the long-troubled Venture magazine , and Lang Communications has announced Ms. magazine , after 17 years , will no longer carry advertising as of January . </s>
<s> Lang is cutting costs and will attempt to operate the magazine with only subscription revenue . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , American Health Partners , publisher of American Health magazine , is deep in debt , and Owen Lipstein , founder and managing partner , is being forced to sell the magazine to Reader 's Digest Association Inc . </s>
<s> Mr. Lipstein 's absence from the meeting here raised speculation that the sale is in trouble . </s>
<s> Mr. Lipstein said in a telephone interview from New York that the sale was proceeding as planned . </s>
<s> `` The magazine is strong . </s>
<s> It 's simply the right time to do what we are doing , '' Mr. Lipstein said . </s>
<s> `` Magazines can no longer be considered institutions , '' said James Autry , president of Meredith Corp. 's magazine group . </s>
<s> `` Publishers will find that some magazines have served their purpose and should die , '' he added . </s>
<s> `` Magazines could , like other brands , find that they have only a limited life . '' </s>
<s> There are also indications that the number of magazine entrepreneurs , traditionally depended upon to break new ground with potentially risky start-ups , are dwindling . </s>
<s> More than ever , independent magazines and small publishing groups are being gobbled up by larger publishing groups , such as American Express Publishing Corp. , a unit of American Express Co. , and Conde Nast Publications Inc. , a unit of Advance Publications Inc. , which are consolidating in order to gain leverage with advertisers . </s>
<s> Some entrepreneurs are still active , though . </s>
<s> Gerry Ritterman , president of New York-based Network Publishing Corp. , earlier this year sold his Soap Opera Digest magazine to Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp . </s>
<s> Mr. Ritterman said that in the next six months he will take $ 50 million from the Soap Opera Digest sale to acquire new magazines . </s>
<s> He would not reveal which magazines he is considering . </s>
<s> `` The magazines I am looking for are underdeveloped , '' said Mr. Ritterman . </s>
<s> `` They could be old or new , but they are magazines whose editorial quality needs to be improved . </s>
<s> They will be the next hot magazines . </s>
