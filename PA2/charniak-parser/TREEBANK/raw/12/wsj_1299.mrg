<s> Some House Democrats are trying to head off an appointment by President Bush to the board that oversees the savings-and-loan bailout , contending that the prospective nominee is the head of troubled banks himself . </s>
<s> Four Democrats on the House Banking Committee sent President Bush a letter stating their concerns about the expected appointment of James Simmons , an Arizona banker and former fund-raiser for Mr. Bush , to the Oversight Board of the Resolution Trust Corp . </s>
<s> The Oversight Board , created in the savings-and-loan law signed in August , sets policy for the RTC , which will sell hundreds of the nation 's sick thrifts and billions of dollars of their assets . </s>
<s> Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady , Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp are members of the board . </s>
<s> President Bush must appoint two other members , one a Democrat and one a Republican . </s>
<s> An administration official confirmed last week that Mr. Simmons , the chairman of Valley National Bank in Phoenix , is the Republican appointee , and that a security clearance was under way . </s>
<s> The Democratic appointee has n't been determined , the official said . </s>
<s> Mr. Simmons declined to comment , and the White House said the congressmen 's letter is under review . </s>
<s> The letter , dated last Thursday , cited the losses at Valley National , and at United Bank , also of Phoenix , where Mr. Simmons was chairman for 29 years . </s>
<s> Both banks have been battered , as have other Arizona banks , by falling real estate prices . </s>
<s> Valley National , for example , had $ 470 million in problem assets as of June . </s>
<s> `` We believe that there are numerous other candidates more qualified for this important position and we encourage you to give them your thorough consideration before making this key RTC appointment , '' the letter said . </s>
<s> `` The RTC needs the most able , competent management available . '' </s>
<s> But Mr. Simmons has long ties to both Republicans and banking . </s>
<s> He was co-chairman of Mr. Bush 's Arizona campaign committee in last year 's election , and also worked for Mr. Bush in the 1980 election . </s>
<s> The two met more than 30 years ago , when Mr. Simmons worked for Commercial Bank & Trust Co. of Midland , Texas , where Mr. Bush was an organizing director . </s>
<s> In 1986 , Mr. Simmons also served on a committee of businessmen headed by William Seidman , chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Resolution Trust Corp . </s>
<s> That committee determined to open Arizona to banking across state lines . </s>
<s> Arizona Trend magazine referred to Mr. Simmons this year as one of the 25 most influential people in the state . </s>
<s> The letter to Mr. Bush was signed by Reps. Bruce Vento -LRB- D. , Minn. -RRB- , the chairman of the Banking Committee 's RTC Task Force , Thomas McMillen -LRB- D. , Md. -RRB- , Kweisi Mfume -LRB- D. , Md . -RRB- and Paul Kanjorski -LRB- D. , Pa . -RRB- . </s>
