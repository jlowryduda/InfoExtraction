<s> Remember those bulky , thick-walled refrigerators of 30 years ago ? </s>
<s> They , or at least something less efficient than today 's thin-walled units , may soon be making a comeback . </s>
<s> That something , whatever it is , could add as much as $ 100 to the $ 600 or so consumers now pay for lower-priced refrigerators . </s>
<s> These and other expensive changes in products ranging from auto air conditioners to foam cushioning to commercial solvents are in prospect because of something called the Montreal Protocol , signed by 24 nations in 1987 . </s>
<s> In one of the most sweeping environmental regulatory efforts to date -- involving products with an annual value of $ 135 billion in the U.S. alone -- the signatories agreed to curtail sharply the use of chlorofluorocarbons -LRB- CFCs -RRB- . </s>
<s> World-wide production would be cut in half by 1998 . </s>
<s> The U.S. Senate liked the treaty so well it ratified it by a vote of 89 to 0 . </s>
<s> Not to be outdone , George Bush wants CFCs banished altogether by the year 2000 , a goal endorsed at an 80-nation U.N. environmental meeting in Helsinki in the spring . </s>
<s> That 's a lot of banishment , as it turns out . </s>
<s> CFCs are the primary ingredient in a gas , often referred to by the Du Pont trade name Freon , which is compressed to liquid form to serve as the cooling agent in refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment . </s>
<s> Gases containing CFCs are pumped into polyurethane to make the foam used in pillows , upholstery and insulation . </s>
<s> Polyurethane foam is a highly efficient insulator , which accounts for why the walls of refrigerators and freezers can be thinner now than they were back in the days when they were insulated with glass fiber . </s>
<s> But even though by some estimates it might cost the world as much as $ 100 billion between now and the year 2000 to convert to other coolants , foaming agents and solvents and to redesign equipment for these less efficient substitutes , the Montreal Protocol 's legions of supporters say it is worth it . </s>
<s> They insist that CFCs are damaging the earth 's stratospheric ozone layer , which screens out some of the sun 's ultraviolet rays . </s>
<s> Hence , as they see it , if something is n't done earthlings will become ever more subject to sunburn and skin cancer . </s>
<s> Peter Teagan , a specialist in heat transfer , is running a project at Arthur D. Little Inc. , of Cambridge , Mass. , to find alternative technologies that will allow industry to eliminate CFCs . </s>
<s> In addition to his interest in ozone depletion he has extensively studied the related topic of global warming , a theory that mankind 's generation of carbon dioxide through increased combustion of fossil fuels is creating a `` greenhouse effect '' that will work important climatic changes in the earth 's atmosphere over time . </s>
<s> `` I would be the first to admit that there is not a complete consensus in the scientific community on either one of these problems , '' says Mr. Teagan . </s>
<s> `` In the kind of literature I read I come across countervailing opinions quite frequently . </s>
<s> But the nature of the problem is such that many others feel it has to be addressed soon , before all the evidence is in . </s>
<s> We ca n't afford to wait . '' </s>
<s> But does it have to be so soon ? </s>
<s> Some atmospheric scientists think that even if CFCs were released into the atmosphere at an accelerating rate , the amount of ozone depletion would be only 10 % by the middle of the next century . </s>
<s> It 's easy to get something comparable by simply moving to a higher altitude in the U.S. . </s>
<s> Moreover , there are questions , particularly among atmospheric scientists who know this subject best , about the ability of anyone to know what in fact is happening to the ozone layer . </s>
<s> It is generally agreed that when CFCs rise from earth to stratosphere , the chlorine in them is capable of interfering with the process through which ultraviolet rays split oxygen molecules and form ozone . </s>
<s> But ozone creation is a very large-scale natural process and the importance of human-generated CFCs in reducing it is largely a matter of conjecture . </s>
<s> The ozone layer is constantly in motion and thus very hard to measure . </s>
<s> What scientists have known since the late 1970s is that there is a hole in the layer over Antarctica that expands or contracts from year to year . </s>
<s> But it is at least worthy of some note that there are very few refrigerators in Antarctica . </s>
<s> Moreover , surely someone has noticed that household refrigerators are closed systems , running for many years without either the CFC gas or the insulation ever escaping . </s>
<s> Another argument of the environmentalists is that if substitutes are available , why not use them ? </s>
<s> Mr. Teagan cites a list of substitutes but none , so far , match the nonflammable , nontoxic CFCs . </s>
<s> Butane and propane can be used as coolants , for example , but are flammable . </s>
<s> Moreover , new lubricants will be needed to protect compressors from the new formulations , which , as with CFCs , are solvents . </s>
<s> Mr. Teagan points out as well that if the equipment designed to get along without CFCs is less efficient than current devices , energy consumption will rise and that will worsen the greenhouse effect . </s>
<s> Folks in the Midwest who just suffered a mid-October snowstorm may wonder where the greenhouse was when they needed it , but let 's not be flippant about grave risks . </s>
<s> As it happens , Arthur D. Little is not at all interested in throwing cold water on ozone depletion and global warming theories . </s>
<s> It is interested in making some money advising industry on how to convert to a world without CFCs . </s>
<s> There is , after all , big money in environmentalism . </s>
<s> Maybe we should ask why it was that Du Pont so quickly capitulated and issued a statement , giving it wide publicity , that it was withdrawing CFCs . </s>
<s> Freon , introduced in 1930 , revolutionized America by making refrigeration and air conditioning practical after all . </s>
<s> One answer is that big companies are growing weary of fighting environmental movements and are trying instead to cash in on them , although they never care to put it quite that way . </s>
<s> Du Pont , as it happens , has a potential substitute for CFCs . </s>
<s> Imperial Chemical Industries of the U.K. also has one , and is building a plant in Louisiana to produce it . </s>
<s> Japanese chemical companies are at work developing their own substitutes and hoping to conquer new markets , of course . </s>
<s> There are still others who do n't mind seeing new crises arise . </s>
<s> Environmental groups would soon go out of business were they not able to send out mailings describing the latest threat and asking for money to fight it . </s>
<s> University professors and consultants with scientific credentials saw a huge market for their services evaporate when price decontrol destroyed the energy crisis and thus the demand for `` alternative energy . '' </s>
<s> They needed new crises to generate new grants and contracts . </s>
<s> In other words , environmentalism has created a whole set of vested interests that fare better when there are many problems than when there are few . </s>
<s> That tends to tilt the public debate toward `` solutions '' even when some of the most knowledgeable scientists are skeptical about the seriousness of the threats and the insistence of urgency . </s>
<s> There is an element of make-work involved . </s>
<s> Consumers pay the bill for all this in the price of a refrigerator or an air-conditioned car . </s>
<s> If they were really getting insurance against environmental disaster , the price would be cheap . </s>
<s> But if there is no impending threat , it can get to be very expensive . </s>
