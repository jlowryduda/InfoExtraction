<s> Euro Disneyland shares made a debut like Snow White yesterday while most of the London stock market looked like it had eaten the Evil Queen 's poisoned apple . </s>
<s> In its first day of when-issued trading here , Euro Disney soared like Dumbo to close at 814 pence -LRB- $ 13.05 -RRB- , up 15 % from its 707-pence offering price . </s>
<s> The overall London market , following Wall Street 's early nosedive , took a late beating . </s>
<s> The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index plummeted 40.4 points to close at 2149.3 . </s>
<s> Traders credited Euro Disney 's share performance to the tremendous hyping of the project that the shares are destined to help finance : Walt Disney Co. 's 4,800-acre theme park 20 miles east of Paris . </s>
<s> The park is slated to open in 1992 . </s>
<s> `` The issue was very well-received -- Disney is such a well-known , you can say world-wide , name , '' said Vernon Dempsey , head trader of European equities at Kleinwort Benson Ltd. , which is making a market in the issue . </s>
<s> Mr. Dempsey estimated that the issue 's London debut was accompanied by `` very , very heavy turnover -- between five million and six million shares . '' </s>
<s> Most of the buying was institutional , he added . </s>
<s> Official trading in the shares will start in London , Paris and Brussels on Nov. 6 , when the French-franc denominated offering , valued at the equivalent of nearly $ 1 billion , comes to market in the European Community . </s>
<s> U.S. investors will be permitted to buy the shares from EC investors 90 days later . </s>
<s> Because of the interest connected with the issue , the London exchange took the unusual step of letting traders establish an officially sanctioned when-issued market . </s>
<s> A volatile , unofficial `` gray '' market in the shares has been operating in Paris for about two weeks . </s>
<s> In contrast to the London performance , Euro Disney there closed down three francs yesterday , at 79 1\/2 francs -LRB- $ 12.66 -RRB- bid , but still about 10 % over the 72-franc offering price . </s>
<s> `` A lot of people are getting hurt on this wicked whipsawing , '' cautioned Alistair Cuddeford , a London-based Salomon Brothers International Ltd. trader who makes a market in franc-denominated Euro Disney shares . </s>
<s> `` There should be no great rush for investors to buy this . </s>
<s> A lot of big European banks , mostly French , and Swiss arb accounts have been buying the stock just to flip it '' for a quick profit , he said . </s>
