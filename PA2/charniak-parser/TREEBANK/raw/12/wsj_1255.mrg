<s> The Food and Drug Administration banned all imports of mushrooms from China in response to a rash of food-poisoning outbreaks linked to canned Chinese mushrooms . </s>
<s> `` The agency has concluded that contamination may be widespread throughout the mushroom-processing industry in China , '' an FDA spokesman said yesterday . </s>
<s> The agency wo n't allow mushrooms that were canned or packed in brine at any Chinese plant to enter the U.S. until `` satisfactory sanitation-control measures are implemented in China to prevent '' bacterial contamination . </s>
<s> On May 19 , the FDA began detaining Chinese mushrooms in 68-ounce cans after more than 100 people in Mississippi , New York and Pennsylvania became ill from eating tainted mushrooms . </s>
<s> In subsequent tests , the agency found smaller-size cans from several Chinese plants to be similarly contaminated . </s>
<s> The outbreaks were traced to staphylococcus aureus , a type of bacteria that produces a toxin capable of surviving the high temperatures used in canning vegetables . </s>
<s> A recall of the mushrooms blamed for the food poisoning began in early March . </s>
<s> In 1987 , China exported 65 million pounds of mushrooms , valued at $ 47 million , to the U.S. . </s>
<s> The shipments went mostly to food-service distributors that supply pizzerias and restaurants . </s>
<s> A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy here said that the Beijing government has taken `` many effective measures '' to stop the mushroom contamination and is further investigating the underlying causes . </s>
<s> He predicted the problem will be solved `` very soon . '' </s>
