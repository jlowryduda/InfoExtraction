<s> Copper futures sold off sharply yesterday , influenced by declines in the stock market and dollar , and a rally in bonds . </s>
<s> December copper opened near Monday 's close , tried to rally but failed , and then triggered stop-loss orders on its way down to settle at $ 1.1510 a pound , off 4.50 cents for the day . </s>
<s> Stop-loss orders are placed previously with instructions to execute them if the market hits a predetermined price . </s>
<s> William Kaiser , president of the Kaiser Financial Group in Chicago , said the decline was almost certainly influenced by the early sell-off in the stock market , which partly reflected a weakening economy . </s>
<s> He said the recent decline in copper stocks was misleading in the face of a slowdown in manufacturing . </s>
<s> Mr. Kaiser said traders could have picked up signals of an imminent price decline had they been watching the scrap metal markets , which became noticeably weaker two to three weeks ago . </s>
<s> But though a weakening economy implies reduced demand , Mr. Kaiser said that Third World copper-producing countries have n't any choice but to sell copper . </s>
<s> They might even step up sales in a falling market , he said , in an effort to maintain the flow of foreign exchange into their treasuries . </s>
<s> Technically , Mr. Kaiser noted that a lot of traders had bought into the market when the price was in the $ 1.24 to $ 1.26 range , thinking there was support at the $ 1.20 level . </s>
<s> When the market fell below that level on Monday and then yesterday could n't climb above that level , traders started selling out their positions . </s>
<s> Betty Raptopoulos , senior metals analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities in New York , agreed that most of the selling was of a technical nature . </s>
<s> She said the market hit the $ 1.18 level at around 10 a.m. EDT where it encountered a large number of stop-loss orders . </s>
<s> More stop-loss orders were touched off all the way down to below $ 1.14 , where modest buying was attracted . </s>
<s> Ms. Raptopoulos said the settling of strikes in Canada and Mexico will have little effect on supplies of copper until early next year . </s>
<s> She thinks the next area of support for copper is in the $ 1.09 to $ 1.10 range . </s>
<s> `` I believe that as soon as the selling abates somewhat we could see a rally back to the $ 1.20 region , '' she added . </s>
<s> She thinks a recovery in the stock market would help copper rebound as well . </s>
<s> She noted that the preliminary estimate of the third-quarter gross national product is due out tomorrow and is expected to be up about 2.5 % to 3 % . </s>
<s> `` If the number is a little better , then copper will respond positively , if it is worse then more selling could ensue , '' she predicted . </s>
<s> Ms. Raptopoulos noted that relating economic numbers to specific market activity is tricky . </s>
<s> Yesterday , for example , `` the durable goods numbers came out for September and the number was down only 0.1 % , '' she said . </s>
<s> `` However , if you exclude defense-related orders then durable goods were down 3.9 % . </s>
<s> I believe that number reflects a slowing economy . '' </s>
<s> She said copper traders will also be looking toward the release of the index of leading economic indicators next Tuesday . </s>
<s> However , David Threlkeld , president of Threlkeld & Co. , an international metals company , noted that so far this year copper consumption is way ahead of the same period of 1988 , and that projected production is below last year . </s>
<s> Mr. Threlkeld said the copper market seems to be anticipating a recession in three months , with declining use being the result . </s>
<s> `` But , '' he added , `` we have had that exact same perception six times in the last six years . '' </s>
<s> He noted that currently the ratio of available copper to consumption is about 3.5 weeks . </s>
<s> He said the normal ratio is five to six weeks . </s>
<s> According to Mr. Threlkeld , the bottleneck in copper production is n't at the mines but at the copper refineries . </s>
<s> `` It takes three months to turn copper concentrate into cathodes , '' he said . </s>
<s> If there is n't a recession , he said , `` we will be out of copper by the end of March . </s>
<s> If there is a recession that will change the statistical situation . '' </s>
<s> He thinks that without a recession copper prices could exceed a high of $ 1.65 a pound , which was reached last year . </s>
<s> In the past Mr. Threlkeld has been known to have substantial long positions that is , he had bought copper futures in anticipation of rising prices -- in the copper futures market . </s>
<s> In other commodity markets yesterday : </s>
<s> ENERGY : The attitude was `` wait-and-see '' in crude oil futures yesterday in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange . </s>
<s> Prices for the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude remained locked in a fairly narrow range before ending the session four cents lower at $ 19.72 a barrel for December delivery . </s>
<s> Several analysts and brokers said the petroleum market was ready to rally after two days of price declines from profit-taking . </s>
<s> But an early 80-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average stopped the crude rally cold . </s>
<s> The industrial average recovered to close only 3.69 points lower , but petroleum futures never shook off the chill . </s>
<s> Most market participants said they were looking to this week 's inventory statistics from the American Petroleum Institute to give the market some direction . </s>
<s> The report is n't generally available until late on Tuesdays . </s>
<s> PRECIOUS METALS : Futures prices inched upward in mostly lackluster trading . </s>
<s> December gold was up $ 3.20 an ounce at $ 373.40 ; December silver gained 5.7 cents to $ 5.1950 an ounce . </s>
<s> January platinum rose $ 2.30 an ounce to $ 488.60 . </s>
<s> Mr. Kaiser said there were no fundamental factors moving these markets . </s>
<s> He noted that two weeks ago there were rumors of Soviet sales of precious metals to finance grain purchases , but the sales do n't seem to have materialized . </s>
<s> Ms. Raptopoulos thought yesterday 's price action reflected weakness in the stock market and the dollar . </s>
<s> `` Gold still acts as a haven when uncertainty prevails in the financial markets as it did '' yesterday , she said . </s>
<s> Mr. Kaiser noted that gold was more than 71 times the price of silver at the close yesterday , which is historically high . </s>
<s> `` The high ratio reflects the fact that silver is still regarded as about a half-industrial metal and its price lagging relative to gold says that traders are expecting a weakening economy , '' he said . </s>
<s> GRAINS AND SOYBEANS : Prices closed lower after trading in relatively narrow ranges because of strong selling in the cash market and continued favorable harvest weather . </s>
<s> The sale to the Chinese government of 330,000 metric tons of wheat under the government 's export enhancement program was announced after the close of trading Monday , but the sale was expected and failed to buoy prices yesterday , said Dale Gustafson , a futures analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago . </s>
<s> As for other export customers , the Soviet Union is n't expected to be back buying U.S. corn in significant amounts until early next year , he said . </s>
<s> A number of commercial grain users buttressed that opinion yesterday by buying certain corn options for delivery in March , indicating to analysts that the commercial companies would use the options to hedge against expected corn sales in next year 's first quarter . </s>
<s> COCOA : Futures at first continued the rally begun on Monday , but then faltered and closed lower . </s>
<s> The December contract opened just under Monday 's close , triggered some previously placed buy orders just above $ 1,030 a metric ton , pushing the price to $ 1,040 , and then encountered heavy selling by traders who buy and sell for their own accounts and by commercial interests . </s>
<s> The contract settled at $ 1,014 a ton , off $ 13 . </s>
<s> Robert Hafer , senior commodities analyst at Kaiser Financial Group , said Monday 's rally continued yesterday for only about 20 minutes after the opening . </s>
<s> He said even though there was arbitrage buying in New York because of the weak dollar , cocoa fell to relentless pressure from bearish traders . </s>
<s> But he noted that speculators apparently do n't believe there is much more of a decline in store for cocoa . </s>
<s> The December contract reached its life-of-contract low of $ 975 a ton on Oct. 11 ; its lifetime high was $ 1,735 , set in 1988 , and its recent high was $ 1,368 , set in early August . </s>
<s> The last time cocoa traded at prices as low as currently was in 1974 . </s>
<s> But while further modest declines might be ahead , Mr. Hafer said it would be difficult to get through resistance levels just above yesterday 's high . </s>
