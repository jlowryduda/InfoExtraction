<s> Shaken by tumbling stock prices and pessimistic projections of U.S. economic growth , currency analysts around the world have toned down their assessments of the dollar 's near-term performance . </s>
<s> Most of the 10 analysts polled last week by Dow Jones International News Service in Frankfurt , Tokyo , London and New York expect the U.S. dollar to ease only mildly in November . </s>
<s> Opinion is mixed over its three-month prospects . </s>
<s> Half of those polled see the currency trending lower over the next three months , while the others forecast a modest rebound after the New Year . </s>
<s> In late afternoon New York trading yesterday , the dollar stood at 1.8415 West German marks , up from 1.8340 marks late Monday , and at 142.85 yen , up from 141.90 yen late Monday . </s>
<s> A month ago , a similar survey predicted the dollar would be trading at 1.8690 marks and 139.75 yen by the end of October . </s>
<s> Sterling was trading at $ 1.5805 , down from $ 1.5820 late Monday . </s>
<s> In Tokyo Wednesday , the U.S. currency was trading at about 142.95 yen at midmorning , up from 142.80 yen at the opening and up from Tuesday 's Tokyo close of 142.15 yen . </s>
<s> The average of estimates of the 10 economists polled puts the dollar around 1.8200 marks at the end of November and at 141.33 yen . </s>
<s> By late January , the consensus calls for the dollar to be trading around 1.8200 marks and near 142 yen . </s>
<s> Those with a bullish view see the dollar trading up near 1.9000 marks and 145 yen , while the dollar bears see the U.S. currency trading around 1.7600 marks and 138 yen . </s>
<s> A number of those polled predict the dollar will slip as the Federal Reserve eases interest rates . </s>
<s> David Owen , an economist at Kleinwort Benson & Co. in London , said he expects further cuts in short-term U.S. rates in an effort to encourage a narrowing of the trade gap and to ensure a soft landing in the U.S. economy . </s>
<s> Robert White , a vice president and manager of corporate trade at First Interstate of California , agreed with that view and predicted the U.S. federal funds rate will drop to between 7 3\/4 % and 8 % within 60 days from its current level at 8 13\/16 % . </s>
<s> Fed funds is the rate banks charge each other on overnight loans ; the Fed influences the rate by adding or draining reserves from the banking system . </s>
<s> Mr. White also predicted a half-point cut in the U.S. discount rate in the near future . </s>
<s> The discount rate , currently 7 % , is the rate the Fed charges member banks for loans , using government securities as collateral . </s>
<s> He expects such a cut `` because of problems in several sectors of the economy , particularly real estate and automobiles . '' </s>
<s> Bolstering his argument , the Commerce Department reported yesterday that new home sales for September were down 14 % from August 's revised 3.1 % fall . </s>
<s> The drop marked the largest monthly tumble since a 19 % slide in January 1982 . </s>
<s> In last month 's survey , a number of currency analysts predicted the dollar would be pressured by a narrowing of interest rate differentials between the U.S. and West Germany . </s>
<s> Indeed , in early October the West German central bank raised its discount and Lombard rates by a full percentage point . </s>
<s> Several other European central banks , notably in Britain , followed the West German Bundesbank 's lead by raising their own key rates . </s>
<s> And a week later , Japan raised its official discount rate by a half point to 3.75 % . </s>
<s> The Japanese discount rate is the central bank 's base rate on loans to commercial banks . </s>
<s> After a surprisingly sharp widening in the U.S. August merchandise trade deficit -- $ 10.77 billion from a revised $ 8.24 billion in July and well above expectations -- and a startling 190-point drop in stock prices on Oct. 13 , the Federal Reserve relaxed short-term interest rates , knocking fed funds from around 9 % to 8 3\/4 % . </s>
<s> But predictions that central banks of the Group of Seven -LRB- G-7 -RRB- major industrial nations would continue their massive dollar sales went astray , as the market drove the dollar downward on its own , reacting to Wall Street 's plunge and subsequent price volatility , lower U.S. interest rates and signs of a slowing U.S. economy . </s>
<s> G-7 consists of the U.S. , Japan , Britain , West Germany , Canada , France and Italy . </s>
<s> Tomoshige Kakita , senior deputy manager in the treasury department of Mitsui Bank Ltd. in Tokyo , suggested that uncertainty about U.S. stocks and bonds has made Japanese investors leery of holding those securities in the near term , thus damping dollar demand . </s>
<s> But , Mr. Kakita added , once U.S. equities regain some stability , players will move back into dollar-denominated investments , especially Treasury bonds , whose value rises when interest rates decline . </s>
<s> Mr. Kakita said the key dollar-yen exchange rate is at 135 yen . </s>
<s> `` If 135 is broken , some panic will be seen , '' he predicted , explaining that Japanese institutions are comfortable with the dollar anywhere between current levels and 135 yen . </s>
<s> Jens-Uwe Fischer , a senior trader at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in Frankfurt , said he expects the dollar to recover within the next three months to around 1.88 marks as U.S. economic data , particularly U.S. trade figures , level off . </s>
<s> He contended that the Fed wo n't ease rates further , but predicted Bundesbank officials will relax key rates in West Germany . </s>
<s> Alfred Zapfel , chief trader at Bank of Boston in Frankfurt , took an opposite stance . </s>
<s> He said he expects U.S. interest rates to decline , dragging the dollar down to around 1.80 marks by the end of January after a short-lived dash to 1.87 marks by the end of November . </s>
<s> West German interest rates , he said , will remain unchanged . </s>
<s> `` But I 'm not one of these great dollar bears you see more of these days , '' Mr. Zapfel said . </s>
<s> `` I ca n't really see it dropping far below 1.80 marks . '' </s>
<s> Scott Greene , chief foreign exchange dealer with Julius Baer & Co. in New York , fits the description of a `` great dollar bear . '' </s>
<s> He predicted the U.S. unit will skid below 1.80 marks to around 1.78 marks this month and 1.75 marks by the beginning of the new year . </s>
<s> `` We 're finally seeing the culmination of all the recessionary buildup of the last few months , '' he said , noting a continuing downward trend in U.S. interest rates , a shaky stock market and `` gloomier economic times ahead '' all signal a significantly lower dollar . </s>
<s> In the wake of British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson 's surprise resignation and sterling 's subsequent nose-dive , most analysts had little good to say about the pound 's near-term prospects . </s>
<s> Mr. Owen of Kleinwort Benson suggested that the new chancellor , John Major , will take a tough line in his autumn statement later this month , helping to underpin the pound . </s>
<s> But , he warned , the currency will remain at risk . </s>
<s> On the Commodity Exchange in New York , gold for current delivery dropped $ 3.10 to $ 374.70 an ounce in moderate trading . </s>
<s> Estimated volume was 3.5 million ounces . </s>
<s> In early trading in Hong Kong Wednesday , gold was quoted at $ 373.80 an ounce . </s>
