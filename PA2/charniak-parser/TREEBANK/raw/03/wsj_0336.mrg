<s> LTV Steel Co. is boosting the prices of flat rolled steel products by an average of 3 % following a recent erosion in the prices of such crucial steel products . </s>
<s> The big questions are whether the increase , effective Jan. 1 , 1990 , will stick , and whether other major steelmakers will follow suit . </s>
<s> It is widely expected that they will . </s>
<s> The increase is on the base price , which is already being discounted by virtually all steel producers . </s>
<s> But LTV 's move marks the first effort by a major steelmaker to counter the free fall in spot prices . </s>
<s> Major steel producers are selling cold rolled sheet steel at about $ 370 a ton , compared with a peak price of $ 520 a ton in 1988 . </s>
<s> Second-tier companies are receiving even less per ton . </s>
<s> LTV 's planned increase , which was announced in an Oct. 26 memo to district managers , does n't affect electrogalvanized steel or tin plate . </s>
<s> LTV confirmed the price-increase plan , saying the move is designed to more accurately reflect the value of products and to put steel on more equal footing with other commodities . </s>
<s> A spokesman for LTV Steel , which is a unit of Dallas-based LTV Corp. , noted that steel prices , adjusted for inflation , increased only 1.7 % between 1981 and the fourth quarter of 1988 , while the prices of other industrial commodities increased nearly five times as much . </s>
<s> At the same time , steelmakers are trying to invest more to modernize technology and make themselves more competitive . </s>
<s> But analysts say the company is also trying to prevent further price drops . </s>
<s> Moreover , they note that LTV may be trying to send a signal to major customers , such as Chrysler Corp. and Whirlpool Corp. , that steelmakers need more money . </s>
<s> Both companies are in the process of negotiating contracts with LTV and others . </s>
<s> `` They -LCB- LTV -RCB- may believe this can impact contract negotiations and is their signal to the world that now is the time to get tough on prices , '' said Peter Marcus , an analyst with PaineWebber Inc . </s>
<s> Mr. Marcus believes spot steel prices will continue to fall through early 1990 and then reverse themselves . </s>
<s> He is n't convinced , though , that the price decline reflects falling demand because the world economy remains relatively strong . </s>
<s> And while customers such as steel service centers are continuing to reduce inventories through the fourth quarter , they eventually will begin stocking up again , he notes . </s>
<s> It wo n't be clear for months whether the price increase will stick . </s>
<s> Steelmakers announced a round of base-price increases last year , but began offering sizable discounts over the summer . </s>
<s> In fact , LTV was the first steelmaker to publicly boost discounts for buyers of cold rolled sheet steel and hot-dipped galvanized sheet steel . </s>
<s> In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday , LTV common shares fell 12.5 cents to close at $ 1.50 . </s>
