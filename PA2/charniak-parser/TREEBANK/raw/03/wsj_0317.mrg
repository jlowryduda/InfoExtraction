<s> Georgia-Pacific Corp. 's unsolicited $ 3.19 billion bid for Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. was hailed by Wall Street despite a cool reception by the target company . </s>
<s> William R. Laidig , Nekoosa 's chairman , chief executive officer and president , characterized the $ 58-a-share bid as `` uninvited '' and said Nekoosa 's board would consider the offer `` in due course . '' </s>
<s> T. Marshall Hahn Jr. , Georgia-Pacific 's chairman and chief executive , said in an interview that all terms of the offer are negotiable . </s>
<s> He added that he had spoken with Mr. Laidig , whom he referred to as a friend , by telephone Monday evening . </s>
<s> `` I 'm hopeful that we 'll have further discussions , '' Mr. Hahn said . </s>
<s> On Wall Street , takeover stock traders bid Nekoosa 's stock well above the Georgia-Pacific bid , assuming that Nekoosa 's will either be sold to a rival bidder or to Georgia-Pacific at a higher price -- as much as $ 75 a share , according to some estimates . </s>
<s> Yesterday , Nekoosa common closed in composite New York Stock Exchange trading at $ 62.875 , up $ 20.125 , on volume of almost 6.3 million shares . </s>
<s> Georgia-Pacific closed down $ 2.50 , at $ 50.875 in Big Board trading . </s>
<s> Takeover stock traders noted that with the junk-bond market in disarray , Georgia-Pacific 's bid is an indication of where the takeover game is headed : namely , industrial companies can continue bidding for one another , but financial buyers such as leveraged buy-out firms will be at a disadvantage in obtaining financing . </s>
<s> `` The way the world is shaping up , the strategic buyer is going to be the rule and the financial buyer is going to be the exception , '' said one trader . </s>
<s> For the paper industry specifically , most analysts said the deal will spur a wave of paper-company takeovers , possibly involving such companies as Union Camp Corp. , Federal Paperboard Co. and Mead Corp . </s>
<s> The analysts argued that Georgia-Pacific 's offer , the first hostile bid ever among major players in the paper industry , ends the unwritten taboo on hostile bids , and will push managements to look closely at the industry 's several attractive takeover candidates . </s>
<s> `` Consolidation has been long overdue . </s>
<s> It was just the culture of the industry that kept it from happening . </s>
<s> The Georgia-Pacific offer has definitely changed the landscape , '' said Gary Palmero of Oppenheimer & Co . </s>
<s> Added Mark Rogers of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. : `` It 's much easier to be second . '' </s>
<s> A Georgia-Pacific acquisition of Nekoosa would create the largest U.S. forest-products company . </s>
<s> Based on 1988 sales , Georgia-Pacific ranked third at $ 9.51 billion , behind Weyerhaeuser Co. at $ 10 billion and International Paper Co. at $ 9.53 billion . </s>
<s> Nekoosa ranked 11th with sales of $ 3.59 billion . </s>
<s> The combined company would have had 1988 sales of $ 13.1 billion . </s>
<s> But such a combination also presents great risks . </s>
<s> At a time when most analysts and industry consultants say pulp and paper prices are heading for a dive , adding capacity and debt could squeeze Georgia-Pacific if the industry declines more than the company expects . </s>
<s> Moreover , any unexpected strengthening of the dollar would hurt Georgia-Pacific because two of Nekoosa 's major product lines -- containerboard , which is used to make shipping boxes , and market pulp -- are exported in large quantities . </s>
<s> `` Nobody knows how deep the cycle is going to be , '' said Rod Young , vice president of Resource Information Systems Inc. , a Bedford , Mass. , economic-forecasting firm . </s>
<s> `` Depending on how far down you go , it may be difficult to pay off that debt . '' </s>
<s> One person familiar with Georgia-Pacific said the acquisition would more than double the company 's debt of almost $ 3 billion . </s>
<s> It also could be a drag on Georgia-Pacific earnings because the roughly $ 1.5 billion in goodwill -- the amount by which the bid exceeds Nekoosa 's book value of $ 1.5 billion -- will have to be subtracted from earnings over a period of decades . </s>
<s> Georgia-Pacific 's Mr. Hahn said that a combined operation would allow savings in many ways . </s>
<s> The two companies each produce market pulp , containerboard and white paper . </s>
<s> That means goods could be manufactured closer to customers , saving shipping costs , he said . </s>
<s> Moreover , production runs would be longer , cutting inefficiencies from adjusting machinery between production cycles . </s>
<s> And Georgia-Pacific could save money in selling pulp , because the company uses its own sales organization while Nekoosa employs higher-cost agents . </s>
<s> Mr. Hahn said Georgia-Pacific has accounted in its strategy for a `` significant downturn '' in the pulp and paper industry , an event that he said would temporarily dilute earnings . </s>
<s> But he said that even under those conditions , the company still would realize a savings of tens of millions of dollars in the first year following a merger . </s>
<s> `` The fit is so good , we see this as a time of opportunity , '' he said . </s>
<s> Georgia-Pacific , which has suspended its stock-repurchase program , would finance the acquisition with all bank debt , provided by banks led by BankAmerica Corp . </s>
<s> Georgia-Pacific owns 349,900 Nekoosa shares and would need federal antitrust clearance to buy more than $ 15 million worth . </s>
<s> U.S. clearance also is needed for the proposed acquisition . </s>
<s> For Nekoosa , defense options may be undercut somewhat by the precarious state of the junk-bond market , which limits how much value the target could reach in a debt-financed recapitalization . </s>
<s> The company 's chairman , Mr. Laidig , and a group of advisers met at the offices of Wachtel Lipton Rosen & Katz , a law firm specializing in takeover defense . </s>
<s> Nekoosa also is being advised by Goldman , Sachs & Co . </s>
<s> Georgia-Pacific 's advisers are Wasserstein , Perella & Co. , which stands to receive a $ 15 million fee if the takeover succeeds , and the law firm of Shearman & Sterling . </s>
<s> People familiar with Nekoosa said its board is n't likely to meet before the week after next to respond to the bid . </s>
<s> The board has 10 business days to respond . </s>
<s> In addition to the usual array of defenses , including a so-called poison pill and a staggered board , Nekoosa has another takeover defense : a Maine state law barring hostile bidders from merging acquired businesses for five years . </s>
<s> Nekoosa is incorporated in Maine . </s>
<s> Georgia-Pacific has filed a lawsuit in federal court in Maine challenging the poison pill and the Maine merger law . </s>
<s> Nekoosa 's poison pill allows shareholders to vote to rescind it , but Georgia-Pacific is n't likely to pursue such a course immediately because that would take 90 to 120 days , and would n't affect the provisions of the Maine law . </s>
<s> Among companies mentioned by analysts as possible counterbidders for Nekoosa are International Paper , Weyerhaeuser , Canadian Pacific Ltd. and MacMillan Bloedel Ltd . </s>
<s> `` I 'm sure everybody else is putting pencil to paper , '' said Kathryn McAuley , an analyst with First Manhattan Co . </s>
<s> International Paper and Weyerhaeuser declined to comment . </s>
<s> Canadian Pacific could n't be reached for comment , and MacMillan Bloedel said it has n't any plans to make a bid for Nekoosa . </s>
<s> Investors were quick to spot other potential takeover candidates , all of which have strong cash flows and low-cost operations . </s>
<s> Among paper company stocks that rallied on the Big Board because of the offer were Union Camp , up $ 2.75 to $ 37.75 , Federal Paperboard , up $ 1.75 to $ 27.875 , Mead , up $ 2.375 to $ 38.75 , and Temple Inland Inc. , up $ 3.75 to $ 62.25 . </s>
<s> In over-the-counter national trading , Bowater Inc. jumped $ 1.50 to $ 27.50 . </s>
<s> Some analysts argued that there wo n't be a flurry of takeovers because the industry 's continuing capacity-expansion program is eating up available cash . </s>
<s> Moreover , some analysts said they expect a foreign paper company with deeper pockets than Georgia-Pacific to end up acquiring Nekoosa , signaling to the rest of the industry that hostile bids are unproductive . </s>
<s> `` This is a one-time event , '' said Lawrence Ross of PaineWebber Inc. , referring to the Georgia-Pacific bid . </s>
<s> But many analysts believe that , given the attractiveness of paper companies ' cash flows , as well as the frantic consolidation of the paper industry in Europe , there will be at least a few more big hostile bids for U.S. companies within the next several months . </s>
<s> The buyers , these analysts added , could be either foreign or other U.S. concerns . </s>
<s> `` The Georgia-Pacific bid may open the door to a new era of consolidation '' in the paper industry , said Mark Devario of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc . </s>
<s> `` I do n't think anyone is now immune from takeover , '' said Robert Schneider of Duff & Phelps Inc. , Chicago . </s>
<s> He added : `` Every paper company management has to be saying to itself , ` Before someone comes after me , I 'm going to go after somebody . ' '' </s>
<s> Prudential-Bache 's Mr. Rodgers said he does n't see the industry 's capacity-expansion program hindering takeover activity . </s>
<s> Several projects , he said , are still on the drawing board . </s>
<s> Moreover , `` it 's a lot cheaper and quicker to buy a plant than to build one . '' </s>
<s> Indeed , a number of analysts said that Japanese paper companies are hungry to acquire additional manufacturing capacity anywhere in the world . </s>
<s> Some predicted that Nekoosa will end up being owned by a Japanese company . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , Shearson Lehman 's Mr. Devario said that , to stay competitive , the U.S. paper industry needs to catch up with the European industry . </s>
<s> Since the most-recent wave of friendly takeovers was completed in the U.S. in 1986 , there have been more than 100 mergers and acquisitions within the European paper industry , he said . </s>
