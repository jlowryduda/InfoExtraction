<s> Technology stocks woke up , helping the over-the-counter market rise from its recent doldrums . </s>
<s> The Nasdaq Composite Index surged 4.26 , or about 0.94 % , to 455.63 . </s>
<s> It was the market 's biggest gain since rising more than 7 points on Oct. 19 . </s>
<s> Advancing OTC stocks outpaced decliners by 1,120 to 806 . </s>
<s> But the move lagged a stronger rise in New York Stock Exchange issues . </s>
<s> The Big Board 's composite index was up more than 1.4 % , and the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1.6 % . </s>
<s> Nasdaq 's gain was led by its biggest industrial stocks . </s>
<s> The Nasdaq 100 rose 7.08 to 445.23 . </s>
<s> The Financial Index of 100 biggest banks and insurance issues added 2.19 to 447.76 . </s>

<s> Intel was up 1 3\/8 to 33 3\/4 . </s>
<s> But traders who watch the stocks warned the rise may be yet another `` one-day phenomenon . '' </s>
<s> Technology stocks bore the brunt of the OTC market 's recent sell-off , and traders say it 's natural that they rebound sharply now that the market has turned around . </s>
<s> But , they caution , conservative investors would do well to sell into the strength . </s>
<s> `` They are always the first to be sold when people are taking profits , because people are most scared of the high-technology stocks , '' said Robin West , director of research for Ladenburg Thalmann 's Lanyi division , which specializes in emerging growth stocks . </s>
<s> The technology group includes many of the OTC market 's biggest stocks , which dominate the market-weighted Nasdaq Composite Index . </s>
<s> Analysts say rallies in the group historically have lifted the market , while weakness in the sector often sank unlisted share prices broadly . </s>
<s> But increasing volatility in the sector has exhausted investors who try to follow its dips and swings . </s>
<s> The stocks have been pummeled repeatedly by inventory gluts and disappointing earnings as the industry matures and slows . </s>
<s> Some even claim the group has become a lagging , not leading , indicator . </s>
<s> The technology sector of the Dow Jones Equity Market Index has risen only about 6.24 % this year , while the Nasdaq Composite Index has gained 18.35 % . </s>
<s> While the composite index lost less than a third of its year-to-date gains in the market 's recent decline , the technology group 's gains were more than halved . </s>
<s> The OTC technology sector is far from a cohesive unit . </s>
<s> The group is divided primarily between software , semiconductors and computers . </s>
<s> While computer stocks have taken the biggest hit from the slowdown in the industry , many software and semiconductor stocks have continued to outperform the market . </s>
<s> Microsoft is up more than 50 % this year , while Intel is up more than 40 % . </s>
<s> The technology group is also split between large companies and small , with the biggest stocks trading as blue-chip issues in the institutional marketplace , while the smaller stocks churn on their individual merits or faults , analysts say . </s>
<s> The volatility of smaller technology companies has served the group well overall in recent stock trading , according to Hambrecht & Quist 's technology stock indexes . </s>
<s> The brokerage firm tracks technology stocks with its Technology Index , which appreciated only 10.59 % in the first nine months of this year . </s>
<s> But the firm also tracks smaller technology companies as a subset of the larger group . </s>
<s> That index , which contains technology companies with annual revenues of $ 200 million or less , gained 17.97 % by Sept. 30 this year -- still lagging the S&P 500 , but leading larger technology firms . </s>
<s> Yesterday , bank stocks lagged behind the overall OTC market . </s>
<s> The Nasdaq Bank Index rose 0.17 to 432.78 . </s>
<s> George Jennison , who trades bank stocks for Shearson Lehman Hutton , said the stocks tend to fall behind because they are n't traded as much as many other issues . </s>
<s> But , he added , interest-rate-sensitive stocks in general are stalled . </s>
<s> `` The interest-rate sensitives are n't rallying with the rest of the market because of fears about what the -LRB- Federal Reserve -RRB- will do , '' Mr. Jennison said . </s>
<s> He said that investors will scour the October employment report , due out Friday , for clues about the direction of the economy and the immediate outlook for interest rates . </s>
<s> On the other hand , Mr. Jennison noted that the recent slide in bank and thrift stocks was at least halted yesterday . </s>
<s> Shearson Lehman Hutton gave small investors some welcome news by announcing that it would no longer handle index-arbitrage-related program trades for its accounts . </s>
<s> Shearson , with its in-house order execution system , has handled the bulk of such program trades in the over-the-counter market . </s>
<s> The trading has been blamed for much of the market 's recent volatility . </s>
<s> Jaguar topped the most-active list , as its American depository receipts climbed 1 3\/4 to 13 5\/8 with more than 6.6 million ADRs traded . </s>
<s> Britain said it would waive its `` golden share '' in the luxury auto maker if shareholders vote to allow a suitor to acquire more than 15 % of the company . </s>
<s> The announcement effectively removes the British government as an impediment to a takeover of the company , which is being stalked by General Motors and Ford . </s>
<s> Gen-Probe was another active takeover stock . </s>
<s> It surged 2 3\/4 to 6 on volume of more than 1.7 million shares after the company agreed to be acquired by Japan 's Chugai Pharmaceutical for about $ 110 million -- almost double the market price of Gen-Probe 's stock . </s>
<s> Priam Corp. lost 5\/32 to 3\/32 after filing for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code . </s>
<s> MCI Communications added 1 1\/2 to 43 3\/8 . </s>

<s> Yesterday , it received a $ 15 million , three-year contract from Drexel Burnham Lambert . </s>
<s> Florida National Banks of Fla. slid 1 1\/8 to 24 3\/4 . </s>
<s> Late Monday , the Federal Reserve Board said it is delaying approval of First Union Corp. 's proposed $ 849 million acquisition of Florida National Banks pending the outcome of an examination into First Union 's lending practices in low-income heighborhoods . </s>
