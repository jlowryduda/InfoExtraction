<s> Polaroid Corp. 's patent-infringement damages case against Eastman Kodak Co. , one of the highest stakes corporate trials ever , is getting scant attention on Wall Street . </s>
<s> After 78 days of mind-numbing testimony in federal court in Boston , the trial is being all but ignored by analysts and patent attorneys . </s>
<s> Most have read the pre-trial documents , however , and estimate Kodak will be ordered to pay $ 1 billion to $ 1.5 billion for infringing on seven Polaroid patents . </s>
<s> That may be the largest patent award ever , but it is well below the $ 12 billion Polaroid seeks . </s>
<s> The highest patent damage award to date was in 1986 , when Smith International Inc. was ordered to pay $ 205 million to Baker Hughes Inc. for infringing on a patent on an oil drilling bit seal . </s>
<s> The two companies later agreed to settle for $ 95 million . </s>
<s> Few analysts think it is worth their time to slog through the Polaroid trial testimony . </s>
<s> `` It 's like panning for gold outside of Grand Central Station . </s>
<s> You might find something , but the chances are low , '' said Michael Ellman , an analyst at Wertheim Schroder & Co . </s>
<s> And Eugene Glazer , an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. , said : `` If you hired an attorney to be there all the time and give you a -LRB- prediction -RRB- of the eventual award , I would be willing to bet that he would be off '' by a lot . </s>
<s> A 75-day trial in the early 1980s determined that Kodak , based in Rochester , N.Y. , infringed on patents of Polaroid , of Cambridge , Mass . </s>
<s> The main issues remaining are how to calculate damages and whether the infringement was `` willful and deliberate . '' </s>
<s> If so , the damages could be tripled . </s>
<s> Two analysts who have read the transcripts , David Nelson of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Calvert D. Crary , a litigation analyst at Labe , Simpson & Co. , think Judge A. David Mazzone will decide in Kodak 's favor on the `` willful and deliberate '' issue . </s>
<s> Mr. Crary said testimony by Kodak 's patent counsel , Francis T. Carr of Kenyon & Kenyon , showed that `` he worked with Kodak continuously from the outset of the project '' in an effort to avoid infringement . </s>
<s> `` Carr told Kodak on many occasions to avoid various features because of Polaroid 's patent positions , '' and Kodak followed his advice in every instance , Mr. Crary said . </s>
<s> But Irving Kayton , a patent expert at George Mason University School of Law who is familiar with the case , said the fact that seven patents were infringed `` suggests that infringement was willful . </s>
<s> It 's difficult to be that consistently wrong . '' </s>
<s> Observers also wonder whether Judge Mazzone will use the lost-profits method of determining damages , which Polaroid favors because it would result in a larger award , or the reasonable royalty method . </s>
<s> Polaroid claims it could have manufactured and sold all the instant cameras and film sold by Kodak if Kodak had n't entered the market . </s>
<s> Moreover , Polaroid contends it could have sold them at a higher price -- and thus made higher profits -- because it would n't have been forced to match Kodak 's lower prices . </s>
<s> Each side has called a Harvard Business School professor to testify on that issue . </s>
<s> Kodak hired Robert Buzzell and Polaroid brought in Robert J. Dolan . </s>
<s> `` There 's nothing that says that people at Harvard Business school have to agree with each other , '' said Mr. Buzzell . </s>
<s> Testimony is expected to continue until early December . </s>
<s> A decision is n't expected until some time next year . </s>
