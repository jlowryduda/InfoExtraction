<s> Traders nervously watching their Quotron electronic-data machines yesterday morning were stunned to see the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummet 99 points in seconds . </s>
<s> A minute later it soared 128 points , then zoomed back down 113 points , 69 below Friday 's close . </s>
<s> `` It was crazy , '' said Neil Weisman , general partner of Chilmark Capital Corp . </s>
<s> `` It was like flying without a pilot in the front of the plane . '' </s>
<s> But those who said `` This ca n't be happening '' were right . </s>
<s> The Quotrons were wrong . </s>
<s> Quotron Systems Inc. , a Citicorp unit , blamed the 30-minute foul-up on `` a timing problem in our software '' caused by the enormous early volume -- about 145 million shares in the first hour of New York Stock Exchange trading . </s>
<s> The prices of the individual stocks that make up the average were correct , Quotron said , but the average was wrong . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , there was an awful lot of confusion . </s>
<s> At about 10:40 a.m. on the over-the-counter trading desk at a major brokerage firm , a veteran trader who buys and sells some of the most active stocks looked at a senior official and asked , `` What 's going on ? </s>
<s> Is the market up or down ? '' </s>
<s> At the time , Quotron was reporting that the industrial average was down 70 points . </s>
<s> In fact , it was up 24 . </s>
<s> Holly Stark , a vice president who heads the trading desk at Dillon Read Capital Corp. , said that once she figured out the Quotron numbers were wrong , she called brokers to tell them . </s>
<s> `` It 's been kind of annoying , to say the least , '' she said . </s>
<s> To confuse matters further , when UAL Corp. stock finally opened on the New York Stock Exchange at 11:08 a.m. , the price was listed at $ 324.75 a share , up about $ 45 from Friday ; in fact , its true price was $ 224.75 , down $ 55 . </s>
<s> That was the New York Stock Exchange 's blooper . </s>
<s> A spokesman cited a `` technical error '' and declined to elaborate . </s>
<s> And there were other blunders . </s>
<s> When the market opened at 9:30 a.m. EST , a reporter for the Reuters newswire miscalculated the industrial average 's drop as a 4 % decline when it really was down 0.7 % . </s>
<s> `` It was a case of human error , which we found almost immediately and corrected , '' a spokesman for Reuter in New York said . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , some currency traders at West German banks in Frankfurt said they sold dollars on the news and had to buy them back later at higher prices . </s>
<s> But it was the Quotron problems that had lingering effects . </s>
<s> Dillon Read 's Ms. Stark said in early afternoon that she was still viewing prices and other data as subject to verification , and she said portfolio managers continued to question the numbers they saw on the screen . </s>
<s> It was the second time in less than a week that Quotron has had problems calculating the industrial average . </s>
<s> At the start of trading last Wednesday , the average appeared to plunge more than 200 points . </s>
<s> Actually , it was down only a few points at the time . </s>
<s> Quotron said that snafu , which lasted nine minutes , resulted from a failure to adjust for a 4-for-1 stock split at Philip Morris Cos . </s>
<s> A Quotron spokeswoman said recent software changes may have contributed to yesterday 's problems . </s>
<s> She said Quotron switched to a backup system until the problems were corrected . </s>
<s> `` Today of all days , '' she lamented . </s>
<s> `` The eyes of the world were watching us . </s>
