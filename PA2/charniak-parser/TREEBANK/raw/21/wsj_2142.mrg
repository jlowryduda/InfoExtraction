<s> Many skittish mutual fund investors picked up the phone yesterday , but decided not to cash in their chips after all . </s>
<s> As the stock market bounced back , withdrawals of money from stock funds amounted to a mere trickle compared with Black Monday , when investors dumped $ 2.3 billion , or about 2 % of stock-fund assets . </s>
<s> Fidelity Investments , the nation 's largest fund company , said phone volume was more than double its typical level , but still half that of Oct. 19 , 1987 . </s>
<s> Net outflows from Fidelity 's stock funds stood at less than $ 300 million , or below 15 % of the $ 2 billion cash position of the firm 's stock portfolios . </s>
<s> Much of the money was switched into the firm 's money market funds . </s>
<s> Outflows since the close of trading Friday remain below one-third their level of two years ago , Fidelity said . </s>
<s> Other mutual fund companies reported even lighter withdrawal requests . </s>
<s> And some investors at Fidelity and elsewhere even began buying stock funds during the day . </s>
<s> `` Two years ago , there was a lot of redemption activity and trouble with people getting through on the phone , '' said Kathryn McGrath , head of the investment management division of the Securities and Exchange Commission . </s>
<s> This time , `` We do n't have that at all . '' </s>
<s> Of course , the relative calm could be jolted if the market plunges again . </s>
<s> And any strong surge in redemptions could force some funds to dump stocks to raise cash , as some did during Black Monday . </s>
<s> But funds generally are better prepared this time around . </s>
<s> As a group , their cash position of 10.2 % of assets in August -- the latest figure available -- is 14 % higher than two years earlier . </s>
<s> Many fund managers have boosted their cash levels in recent weeks . </s>
<s> The biggest flurry of investor activity came early in the day . </s>
<s> Vanguard Group Inc. saw heavy exchanges from stock funds into money market funds after the telephone lines opened at 8:30 a.m . </s>
<s> `` In the first hour , the real nervous folks came along , '' a spokesman said . </s>
<s> `` But the horrendous pace of call volume in the first half-hour slowed considerably . '' </s>
<s> At Scudder , Stevens & Clark Inc. , phone calls came in at 40 % more than the normal pace through early afternoon . </s>
<s> Most of that increase came in the first hour after the phone lines opened at 8 a.m . </s>
<s> As stocks rose , in fact , some investors changed course and reversed their sell orders . </s>
<s> Many funds allow investors to void orders before the close of trading . </s>
<s> At Scudder and at the smaller Ivy funds group in Hingham , Mass. , for instance , some shareholders called early in the morning to switch money from stock funds to money market funds , but later called back to reverse the switches . </s>
<s> Because mutual fund trades do n't take effect until the market close -- in this case , at 4 p.m. -- these shareholders effectively stayed put . </s>
<s> At Fidelity 's office in downtown Boston , Gerald Sherman walked in shortly after 7:30 a.m. and placed an order to switch his retirement accounts out of three stock funds and into a money market fund . </s>
<s> But by 3:15 p.m. , with the market comfortably ahead for the day , Mr. Sherman was preparing to undo his switch . </s>
<s> `` It 's a nice feeling to know that things stabilized , '' said Mr. Sherman , the 51-year-old co-owner of a discount department store . </s>
<s> But some investors continued to switch out of high-risk , high-yield junk funds despite yesterday 's rebound from that market 's recent price declines . </s>
<s> Shareholders have been steadily bailing out of several big junk funds the past several weeks as the $ 200 billion market was jolted by a cash crunch at Campeau Corp. and steadily declining prices . </s>
<s> Much of the money has been switched into money market funds , fund executives say . </s>
<s> Instead of selling bonds to meet redemptions , however , some funds have borrowed from banks to meet withdrawal requests . </s>
<s> This avoids knocking down prices further . </s>
<s> The $ 1.1 billion T. Rowe Price High Yield Fund was among the funds that borrowed during the Campeau crisis , says George J. Collins , president of T. Rowe Price Associates Inc . </s>
<s> That way , Mr. Collins says , `` We did n't have to sell securities in a sloppy market . '' </s>
<s> When the market stabilized , he added , the firm sold the bonds and quickly paid the loans back . </s>
