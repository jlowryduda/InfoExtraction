<s> Debora Foster takes off her necklace , settles herself on a padded chair and gently leans forward . </s>
<s> With a jazz-piano tape playing softly in the background , the soothing hands of Sabina Vidunas begin to work on Ms. Foster 's neck and shoulders . </s>
<s> `` It 's like an oasis in this room , '' Ms. Foster purrs . </s>
<s> The room in question is the directors ' lounge of H.J. Heinz Co. , 60 floors above the bustle of Pittsburgh . </s>
<s> There , amid oil paintings and marble tables , massages are administered every Wednesday . </s>
<s> `` On days that I 'm really busy , '' says Ms. Foster , who works in public relations for the company , `` it seems decadent to take time off for a massage . '' </s>
<s> Although such sessions may never replace coffee breaks , on-site massage , as it is known in the trade , is certainly infiltrating corporate America . </s>
<s> In some companies middle managers sneak massage therapists into the office , fearful that upper-level executives wo n't approve . </s>
<s> Ms. Foster 's indulgence is nothing like the oily , hour-long rubfests enjoyed by spa visitors . </s>
<s> Nor does it at all resemble -LRB- despite what some executives think -RRB- the more intimate variety offered at specialty parlors in bad parts of town . </s>
<s> On the contrary , office rubdowns usually take place in dimly lighted conference rooms , where stressed-out employees relax in specially designed chairs , fully clothed . </s>
<s> The massages last 15 minutes and typically cost about $ 10 . </s>
<s> Some companies , including Heinz , even pay part of the fee . </s>
<s> Ms. Vidunas has been seeing some 15 clients a visit since the program was started at Heinz last year . </s>
<s> Anthony J.F. O'Reilly , the company 's chairman , swears by her firm touch , saying regular massages are a balm for his old football injuries . </s>
<s> Massage advocates say that kneading the head , shoulders , neck and back can go a long way toward easing tension and improving morale . </s>
<s> They also insist that touching is a basic need , as powerful as the need for food or sleep , and that the office is as good a place as any to do it . </s>
<s> `` The blood flows to your head , you feel lightheaded and you do n't feel tension around the head or neck , '' says Minnie Morey , an operations supervisor at the Social Security office in Grand Rapids , Mich. , where massages began last month . </s>
<s> `` When you leave the room after your massage , people say you look like you 're glowing . '' </s>
<s> Adds Candice Ohlman , the 35-year-old masseuse who plies her trade in the Grand Rapids office , `` They fall in love with my hands . '' </s>
<s> Not everyone , however , is at ease with office massage . </s>
<s> Three years ago , the Internal Revenue Service 's office in San Jose , Calif. , opened its doors to on-site massage . </s>
<s> And even though employees paid the bill , taxpayers grumbled . </s>
<s> `` Sometimes , with the release of stress , you hear ` oohs ' and ` ahs ' coming out of the room , '' explains Morgan Banks , the agency 's health specialist . </s>
<s> `` And you ca n't have taxpayers coming into an audit hearing ` oohs ' and ` ahs . ' '' </s>
<s> Last month , the complaints intensified and the massages ended . </s>
<s> `` Now we 're looking for a room with thicker walls , '' Ms. Banks says . </s>
<s> Massage also has an image problem to contend with . </s>
<s> Some masseurs have tried to get around this by calling themselves `` bodyworkers '' and describing their office visits as `` reinvigoration breaks . '' </s>
<s> But massage , no matter how chaste , is still associated in many minds with seedy fronts for prostitution , and that makes some executives nervous . </s>
<s> Last year , the research and development division of Weyerhaeuser Co. , the large wood-products concern , invited a masseuse to its Tacoma , Wash. , offices . </s>
<s> Phil Harms , a software engineer , was an eager customer . </s>
<s> `` You build up a lot of tension working at a terminal all day , '' he says . </s>
<s> But after about eight months , the vice president of the division , Ed Soule , learned about the sessions and brought them to a halt . </s>
<s> Mr. Soule says his only beef was that the massages were being given in a company conference room ; the department 's supervised health facility would have been fine . </s>
<s> `` In my view , -LCB- massages -RCB- should be managed with an appropriate mixture of males and females around , '' he says . </s>
<s> Given such attitudes , some corporate masseurs prefer to go about their business quietly . </s>
<s> Russell Borner of Park Ridge , N.J. , says he has been working for the past year at a huge chemical and manufacturing concern in New York -- unbeknownst to the company 's executives . </s>
<s> He visits the same department every two or three weeks . </s>
<s> His massage chair is kept in a closet , and a secretary escorts him past security . </s>
<s> `` This is common with a lot of large companies , '' says Mr. Borner , who worked for American Telephone & Telegraph Co. for 23 years before choosing his current trade . </s>
<s> Managers , he contends , `` are afraid how they 're going to look in the eyes of their peers . </s>
<s> My vision is to change human consciousness towards touch . </s>
<s> My attitude is : Let 's come out of the closet . '' </s>
<s> Occasionally , all that 's needed is a little coaxing . </s>
<s> Elisa Byler , a St. Louis masseuse , won over officials at Emerson Electric Co. , a maker of electrical and electronic equipment , by providing documents and other articles trumpeting the therapeutic benefits of massage . </s>
<s> She notes that she also stresses professionalism during her weekly visits . </s>
<s> `` I pull my hair back , wear a little makeup and look corporate , '' says Ms. Byler , who has been visiting Emerson since January . </s>
<s> `` If I go in there as I normally dress , they 'd ask , ` Who is this hippie ? ' '' </s>
<s> The self-proclaimed father of on-site massage is David Palmer , a 41-year-old San Francisco masseur whose mission is to save the touch-starved masses . </s>
<s> To help do this , Mr. Palmer developed a portable massage chair three years ago that he hopes will bring `` structured touching '' into mainstream America . </s>
<s> `` The culture is not ready to take off its clothes , lie down and be touched for an hour for $ 45 , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` The idea is to keep the clothes on and to keep people seated . </s>
<s> The chair is a way to package massage . '' </s>
<s> Sitting in one of Mr. Palmer 's chairs , which cost $ 425 and have since been copied by others , is a bit like straddling a recliner . </s>
<s> Customers lean forward , rest their knees on side supports and bury their face in padding on the back of the chair . </s>
<s> -LRB- Ms. Ohlman , the Grand Rapids masseuse , says she has heard the odd-looking contraption compared to something out of the Spanish Inquisition . -RRB- </s>
<s> Mr. Palmer , who serves as president of the On-Site Massage Association and writes an industry newsletter , says some 4,000 practitioners -- out of about 50,000 certified masseurs across the country -- now use massage chairs in the workplace , as well as on street corners , in airports and malls , and at conventions and other gatherings where weary people can be found . </s>
<s> Scot MacInnis , a masseur in Boulder , Colo. , had a scary experience while massaging a man in a natural-foods supermarket as part of a store promotion . </s>
<s> Three minutes into the massage , the man curled up , began shaking and turned red . </s>
<s> Paramedics were called . </s>
<s> A week later , the man told Mr. MacInnis he had suffered a mild heart attack unrelated to the massage . </s>
<s> `` It was a powerful point in my career , '' says the 31-year-old Mr. MacInnis , who has since taken out a $ 1 million liability policy for his business . </s>
<s> `` But he pulled through , and after the ambulance left , there were still six people in line waiting for a massage . </s>
<s> The next woman was older , and I was afraid to touch her . </s>
<s> But it 's like falling off a horse and getting back on . '' </s>
<s> Despite the number of fans that office massage has won , some purists look down on it , arguing that naked , full-body rubs are the only way to go . </s>
<s> Linda Aldridge , who does full-body work in Pittsburgh , says that while on-site massage is better than nothing , tired workers should realize it is only the tip of the iceberg . </s>
<s> `` Whole areas of their bodies are neglected , '' she says , adding that clothes ruin the experience . </s>
<s> `` There 's nothing like skin to skin . </s>
