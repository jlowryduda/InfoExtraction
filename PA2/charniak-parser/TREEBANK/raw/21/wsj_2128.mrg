<s> A federal appeals court struck down a natural-gas regulation that had prevented pipeline companies from passing to customers part of $ 1 billion in costs from controversial `` take-or-pay '' contracts . </s>
<s> The court , in a 3-0 ruling , threw out a deadline set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for settling old contract disputes over gas that the pipeline companies reserved but did n't use . </s>
<s> FERC 's regulation had given pipelines until March 31 , 1989 , to pass on to customers as much as 50 % of the costs of buying out their broken contracts , which were made with producers when gas prices were high and supplies short . </s>
<s> A majority of old contracts were renegotiated by the deadline and settled at steep discounts . </s>
<s> But pipeline companies estimate they still face $ 2.4 billion in liabilities from unresolved disputes , including $ 1 billion they fear they wo n't be able to pass on to customers . </s>
<s> According to industry lawyers , the ruling gives pipeline companies an important second chance to resolve remaining disputes and take advantage of the cost-sharing mechanism . </s>
<s> The court left open whether FERC could reimpose a new deadline later . </s>
<s> The court , agreeing with pipeline companies , found the March 31 deadline was `` arbitrary and capricious '' and `` highly prejudicial to the bargaining power of pipelines '' that were forced to negotiate settlement of the old take-or-pay contracts to meet the deadline . </s>
<s> A report last month by the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America found that pipelines ' settlement costs had jumped in the three months before the deadline to 39 cents on the dollar , from 22 cents on the dollar in 1988 . </s>
<s> The court ordered FERC to justify within 60 days not only its cost-sharing deadline , but other major elements of its proposed regulation for introducing more competition into natural-gas transportation . </s>
<s> The court also questioned a crediting mechanism that could be used to resolve take-or-pay liabilities . </s>
<s> The complex regulation , known in the industry as Order 500 , has been hotly contested by all sides , including natural-gas producers , pipelines , local distribution companies and consumers . </s>
<s> The court 's decision would allow FERC to change some of its provisions , but ensures it will be reviewed again quickly by the court . </s>
