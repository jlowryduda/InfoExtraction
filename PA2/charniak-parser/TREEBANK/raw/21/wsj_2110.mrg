<s> The Commodity Futures Trading Commission plans to restrict dual trading on commodity exchanges , a move almost certain to infuriate exchange officials and traders . </s>
<s> The CFTC said it will propose the restrictions after the release of a study that shows little economic benefit resulting from dual trading and cites `` problems '' associated with the practice . </s>
<s> Dual trading gives an exchange trader the right to trade both for his own account and for customers . </s>
<s> The issue exploded this year after a Federal Bureau of Investigation operation led to charges of widespread trading abuses at the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange . </s>
<s> While not specifically mentioned in the FBI charges , dual trading became a focus of attempts to tighten industry regulations . </s>
<s> Critics contend that traders were putting buying or selling for their own accounts ahead of other traders ' customer orders . </s>
<s> Traders are likely to oppose such restrictions because dual trading provides a way to make money in slower markets where there is a shortage of customer orders . </s>
<s> The exchanges contend that dual trading improves liquidity in the markets because traders can buy or sell even when they do n't have a customer order in hand . </s>
<s> The exchanges say liquidity becomes a severe problem for thinly traded contracts such as those with a long time remaining before expiration . </s>
<s> The CFTC may take those arguments into account by allowing exceptions to its restrictions . </s>
<s> The agency did n't cite specific situations where dual trading might be allowed , but smaller exchanges or contracts that need additional liquidity are expected to be among them . </s>
<s> Wendy Gramm , the agency 's chairman , told the Senate Agriculture Committee that she expects the study to be released within two weeks and the rule changes to be completed by Thanksgiving . </s>
<s> The study , by the CFTC 's division of economic analysis , shows that `` a trade is a trade , '' a member of the study team said . </s>
<s> Whether a trade is done on a dual or non-dual basis , the member said , `` does n't seem to have much economic impact . '' </s>
<s> Currently , most traders on commodity exchanges specialize in trading either for customer accounts , which makes them brokers , or for their own accounts as socalled locals . </s>
<s> `` The tests indicate that dual and non-dual traders are similar in terms of the trade executions and liquidity they provide to the market , '' Mrs. Gramm told the Senate panel . </s>
<s> Members of Congress have proposed restricting dual trading in bills to reauthorize CFTC operations . </s>
<s> The House 's bill would prohibit dual trading in markets with daily average volume of 7,000 contracts or more , comprising those considered too difficult to track without a sophisticated computer system . </s>
<s> The Senate bill would force the CFTC to suspend dual trading if an exchange ca n't show that its oversight system can detect dual-trading abuses . </s>
<s> So far , one test of restricting dual trading has worked well . </s>
<s> The Chicago Merc banned dual trading in its Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index futures pit in 1987 . </s>
<s> Under the rules , traders decide before a session begins whether they will trade for their own account or for customers . </s>
<s> Traders who stand on the pit 's top step , where most customer orders are executed , ca n't trade for themselves . </s>
<s> A Merc spokesman said the plan has n't made much difference in liquidity in the pit . </s>
<s> `` It 's too soon to tell ... but people do n't seem to be unhappy with it , '' he said . </s>
<s> He said he would n't comment on the CFTC plan until the exchange has seen the full proposal . </s>
<s> But at a meeting last week , Tom Donovan , the Board of Trade 's president , told commodity lawyers : `` Dual trading is definitely worth saving . </s>
<s> It adds something to the market . </s>
