<s> Stanislav Ovcharenko , who represents the Soviet airline Aeroflot here , has some visions that are wild even by the current standards of perestroika . </s>
<s> In his office overlooking the runway of Shannon Airport , Mr. Ovcharenko enthusiastically throws out what he calls `` just ideas '' : </s>
<s> First , he suggests , GPA Group Ltd. , the international aircraft leasing company based in Ireland , could lease some of its Boeing jetliners to the Soviet airline . </s>
<s> Then Aer Lingus , the Irish flag carrier , could teach Aeroflot pilots to fly the Boeings , and the fleet could be based here at Shannon Airport . </s>
<s> That 's not all , he says . </s>
<s> Aer Rianta , the Irish airport authority , could build a cargo terminal in the Soviet Union . </s>
<s> Aeroflot could lease some of its cargo planes to Aer Lingus , through GPA , for a joint-venture cargo airline . </s>
<s> And then there is his notion of an Irish-Soviet charter airline to ferry Armenians to Los Angeles via Shannon . </s>
<s> Have the freedoms of glasnost gone to Mr. Ovcharenko 's head ? </s>
<s> Hardly . </s>
<s> The Irish-Soviet aviation connection is alive and well here at Shannon Airport . </s>
<s> GPA is indeed talking about leasing Western planes to Aeroflot and even about buying Soviet-built Tupolev 204s . </s>
<s> Aer Lingus is in discussions with the Soviet carrier about a cargo venture and other possibilities . </s>
<s> Aer Rianta already has so many ventures with Aeroflot that its chief executive is studying Russian . </s>
<s> Unlikely as it may seem , tiny , politically neutral Ireland has penetrated the mighty Soviet airline bureaucracy . </s>
<s> And as Aeroflot struggles to boost its service standards , upgrade its fleet and pursue commercial opportunities , the Irish aviation industry seems poised to benefit . </s>
<s> `` Irish and Soviet people are similar , '' says Mr. Ovcharenko . </s>
<s> `` They look the same . </s>
<s> They 're very friendly . '' </s>
<s> Moreover , he says , Irish companies are small but spunky . </s>
<s> `` We have to study their experience very well , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` We must find any way to get business . '' </s>
<s> The two groups have been working together since the late 1970s , long before Soviet joint ventures were the rage in the West . </s>
<s> Aeroflot carried about 125 million passengers last year , and Shannon Airport , the airline 's largest transit airport outside the Soviet Union , saw 1,400 Aeroflot flights and 250,000 passengers pass through . </s>
<s> An apartment complex down the road is the crew-rest and staging area for more than 130 Aeroflot pilots and flight attendants . </s>
<s> The airport 's biggest supplier of aircraft fuel is the Soviet Union . </s>
<s> Tankers from the Latvian port of Ventspils each year unload 25 million gallons of fuel into a special tank farm at the airport . </s>
<s> What Aeroflot does n't pour into its own gas-guzzling Ilyushins is bartered to the airport authority , which resells it to 11 Western carriers including Air France , Trans World Airlines and Pakistan International Airlines . </s>
<s> Aeroflot thus pays its landing fees , ground-handling and catering bills with fuel , preserving its hard currency . </s>
<s> That is n't all . </s>
<s> Last year , the Irish airport authority , in a joint venture with Aeroflot , opened four hard-currency duty-free shops at Moscow 's Sheremetyevo Airport . </s>
<s> Aer Rianta now manages duty-free sales on all Aeroflot international flights out of Moscow . </s>
<s> Duty-free shops in Leningrad 's Pulkova Airport opened in July , and hard-currency shops in Leningrad hotels and on the Soviet-Finnish frontier are coming soon . </s>
<s> Aer Rianta is talking about similar joint ventures in Tashkent and in Sochi , a Black Sea resort , and even has a computer-assembly project cooking with the Georgian city of Tbilisi . </s>
<s> Aeroflot 's international fleet of 285 planes is being repainted and refurbished at Shannon Airport . </s>
<s> Thanks to a new air-traffic agreement and the ability of Irish travel agents to issue Aeroflot tickets , tourists here are taking advantage of Aeroflot 's reasonable prices to board flights in Shannon for holidays in Havana , Kingston and Mexico City . </s>
<s> The round-trip fare to Havana is 410 Irish punts -LRB- $ 578 -RRB- . </s>
<s> Jamaica costs 504 punts . </s>
<s> A formal blessing of sorts was bestowed on this friendship in April when Mikhail and Raisa Gorbachev stopped here for talks with Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey . </s>
<s> New trade accords were signed . </s>
<s> It all started with geography . </s>
<s> When it opened in 1939 , Shannon was the first landfall in Europe for thirsty airplanes flying from North America . </s>
<s> Advances in aircraft fuel efficiency over the years made a Shannon stop unnecessary for most Western air fleets , but Aeroflot still flies inefficient Ilyushins that ca n't make it from Moscow to Managua on one hop . </s>
<s> As a result , Ireland did n't spurn the Soviets after they shot down a Korean Air Lines jetliner over the Sea of Japan in 1983 , though it suspended direct Moscow-Shannon flights for two months . </s>
<s> In fact , Aer Lingus started ferrying Russians from Shannon to New York when Washington stripped Aeroflot of its U.S. landing rights . </s>
<s> Today , Aer Rianta is making a heap of money from its Soviet friendship . </s>
<s> And , with those contacts in place , it could be relatively simple to add Aer Lingus and GPA to the team . </s>
<s> Then , perhaps , Mr. Ovcharenko 's ideas would n't sound like so much blarney . </s>
