<s> We 're about to see if advertising works . </s>
<s> Hard on the heels of Friday 's 190-point stock-market plunge and the uncertainty that 's followed , a few big brokerage firms are rolling out new ads trumpeting a familiar message : Keep on investing , the market 's just fine . </s>
<s> Their mission is to keep clients from fleeing the market , as individual investors did in droves after the crash in October </s>
<s> Just days after the 1987 crash , major brokerage firms rushed out ads to calm investors . </s>
<s> This time around , they 're moving even faster . </s>
<s> PaineWebber Inc. filmed a new television commercial at 4 p.m. EDT yesterday and had it on the air by last night . </s>
<s> Fidelity Investments placed new ads in newspapers yesterday , and wrote another new ad appearing today . </s>
<s> Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. by yesterday afternoon had already written new TV ads . </s>
<s> It considered running them during tomorrow night 's World Series broadcast but decided not to when the market recovered yesterday . </s>
<s> Other brokerage firms , including Merrill Lynch & Co. , were plotting out potential new ad strategies . </s>
<s> The brokerage firms learned a lesson the last time around , when frightened investors flooded the phone lines and fled the market in a panic . </s>
<s> This time , the firms were ready . </s>
<s> Fidelity , for example , prepared ads several months ago in case of a market plunge . </s>
<s> When the market went into its free fall Friday afternoon , the investment firm ordered full pages in the Monday editions of half a dozen newspapers . </s>
<s> The ads touted Fidelity 's automated 800-number beneath the huge headline , `` Fidelity Is Ready For Your Call . '' </s>
<s> A Fidelity spokesman says the 800-line , which already was operating but which many clients did n't know about , received about double the usual volume of calls over the weekend . </s>
<s> `` A lot of investor confidence comes from the fact that they can speak to us , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` To maintain that dialogue is absolutely crucial . </s>
<s> It would have been too late to think about on Friday . </s>
<s> We had to think about it ahead of time . '' </s>
<s> Today 's Fidelity ad goes a step further , encouraging investors to stay in the market or even to plunge in with Fidelity . </s>
<s> Underneath the headline `` Diversification , '' it counsels , `` Based on the events of the past week , all investors need to know their portfolios are balanced to help protect them against the market 's volatility . '' </s>
<s> It goes on to plug a few diversified Fidelity funds by name . </s>
<s> PaineWebber also was able to gear up quickly thanks to the 1987 crash . </s>
<s> In the aftermath of the 1987 debacle , the brokerage firm began taping commercials in-house , ultimately getting its timing down fast enough to tape a commercial after the market closed and rush it on the air that night . </s>
<s> It also negotiated an arrangement with Cable News Network under which CNN would agree to air its last-minute creations . </s>
<s> The new PaineWebber commercial , created with ad agency Saatchi & Saatchi Co. , features Mary Farrell , one of the firm 's most visible investment strategists , sounding particularly bullish . </s>
<s> Taped just as the market closed yesterday , it offers Ms. Farrell advising , `` We view the market here as going through a relatively normal cycle ... . </s>
<s> We continue to feel that the stock market is still the place to be for long-term appreciation . '' </s>
<s> The spot was scheduled to appear three times on CNN last night . </s>
<s> PaineWebber considered an even harder sell , recommending specific stocks . </s>
<s> Instead , it settled on just urging the clients who are its lifeline to keep that money in the market . </s>
<s> `` We 're saying the worst thing that anyone can do is to see the market go down and dump everything , which just drives the prices down further , '' says John Lampe , PaineWebber 's director of advertising . </s>
<s> `` If you owned it and liked it Friday , the true value has n't changed . '' </s>
<s> He adds , `` This is n't 1987 revisited . '' </s>
<s> With the market fluctuating and then closing up more than 88 points yesterday , investment firms had to constantly revise their approach . </s>
<s> At Shearson Lehman , executives created potential new commercials Friday night and throughout the weekend , then had to regroup yesterday afternoon . </s>
<s> The plan had been to make one of Shearson 's easy-to-film , black-and-white `` Where We Stand '' commercials , which have been running occasionally in response to news events since 1985 . </s>
<s> The ad would have run during the World Series tomorrow , replacing the debut commercial of Shearson 's new ad campaign , `` Leadership by Example . '' </s>
<s> But in a meeting after the market closed yesterday , Shearson executives decided not to go ahead with the stock-market ad . </s>
<s> `` We do n't think at this point anything needs to be said . </s>
<s> The market seems to be straightening out ; we 're taking a wait-and-see attitude , '' says Cathleen B. Stewart , executive vice president of marketing . </s>
<s> In any case , the brokerage firms are clearly moving faster to create new ads than they did in the fall of 1987 . </s>
<s> But it remains to be seen whether their ads will be any more effective . </s>
<s> In 1987 , despite a barrage of ads from most of the major investment firms , individuals ran from the market en masse . </s>
<s> Now the firms must try their hardest to prove that advertising can work this time around . </s>
