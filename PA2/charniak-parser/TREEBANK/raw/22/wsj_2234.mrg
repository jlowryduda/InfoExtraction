<s> A House-Senate conference approved a permanent smoking ban on all domestic airline routes within the continental U.S. and on all flights of six hours or less to Alaska and Hawaii . </s>
<s> The restrictions would cover all but a small percentage of domestic air traffic , and represent a major expansion of the current smoking ban on flights of two hours or less . </s>
<s> The exemption allowed on longer flights to Alaska and Hawaii appears to be largely a face-saving concession for the traditionally powerful tobacco industry , which has found itself increasingly isolated in the face of public pressure in recent years . </s>
<s> By a 6-4 margin , House negotiators initially rejected last night a Senate provision covering all domestic flights . </s>
<s> But the six-hour compromise was soon agreed to in subsequent discussions . </s>
<s> As a practical matter , flights from the West Coast to Hawaii would be covered as they are under the time limit , but the language would exempt longer routes beginning , for example , in Chicago or on the East Coast . </s>
<s> Within the Senate , the ban has had aggressive support from Sen. Frank Lautenberg -LRB- D. , N.J. -RRB- , who has used his position as a Senate Appropriations subcommittee chairman to garner votes for the initiative . </s>
<s> The measure is attached to the more than $ 26 billion fiscal 1990 transportation bill within Mr. Lautenberg 's jurisdiction , and the final compromise is laced with more than $ 205 million in road projects earmarked by members as well as funds sought by major airports , including Denver . </s>
<s> From the outset , the tobacco industry has been uncertain as to what strategy to follow . </s>
<s> But the industry retains support in the House leadership through the influence of grower states , such as North Carolina . </s>
<s> Majority Whip William Gray owes a political debt to Southern agriculture lawmakers for his rise in the House , and the Philadelphia Democrat used his position in the conference to salvage the exemption from a total ban . </s>
<s> Although the smoking provision has attracted the most public interest , the underlying bill was the subject of behind-the-scenes lobbying because of its impact on air transportation and the more mundane , but politically important , projects of members . </s>
<s> In a stark lesson in the power of the appropriations committees , the House deliberately killed a handful of projects backed by lawmakers in Florida , Illinois and Pennsylvania who had voted against the panel leadership on the House floor . </s>
<s> `` Anybody can vote as they want , '' said Rep. William Lehman -LRB- D. , Fla. -RRB- , head of the House conferees . </s>
<s> `` But if you make a request , you should support the committee . '' </s>
<s> Within the Federal Aviation Administration , the final bill promises to increase spending for facilities and equipment by more than 20 % from last year , and total operations would rise to $ 3.84 billion -- a 12 % boost . </s>
<s> The facilities account includes $ 40 million for Denver 's ambitious new airport , and the competition for these funds created shifting alliances between urban lawmakers representing established airports in Philadelphia and Michigan and the major carriers to Denver , United and Continental . </s>
<s> Leery of the costs -- and , critics say , competition -- the airlines have sought to gain leverage over the city of Denver . </s>
<s> Texas Air Corp. , which owns Continental , and the Air Transport Association were prominent in the lobbying . </s>
<s> The industry sought to impose conditions that would have delayed funds for the project until Denver and the airlines had agreed to leases for 50 % of the gates . </s>
<s> But this was rejected in favor of much looser language directing the Transportation Department to review the costs of the first phase , expected to cost about $ 2 billion . </s>
<s> Though smaller in total dollars , the conference agreed to preserve an estimated $ 30.6 million in controversial subsidies to carriers serving rural or isolated airports . </s>
<s> The sum is more than double what the House had approved for the program , but the list of qualified airports would be cut by 22 under new distance requirements and limits on the level of subsidy . </s>
<s> Congress previously cut six airports this year . </s>
<s> The impact of the changes is to eliminate many of the most excessive cases where the government has been paying more than $ 200 for each passenger in subsidies . </s>
<s> Among rail and highway accounts , the agreement provides $ 615 million for Amtrak , including $ 85 million for capital improvements . </s>
<s> And federal-formula grants for mass transit would be effectively frozen at $ 1.625 billion , or $ 20 million more than last fiscal year . </s>
