<s> First , there was a death watch . </s>
<s> Then exhilaration . </s>
<s> Spurred by waves of large-scale buying in blue-chip stocks , the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied yesterday and erased about a half of Friday 's 190.58-point plunge , gaining 88.12 to 2657.38 . </s>
<s> It was the fourth-biggest advance for the average of 30 blue chips , on frenetic New York Stock Exchange volume of 416,290,000 shares -- the highest since the days after the 1987 crash . </s>
<s> While the advance cheered investors who feared a 1987-style crash would occur yesterday , it was strictly a big-stock rally fed by huge buying by bargain-hunting institutions and program traders . </s>
<s> A troubling sign : Declining stocks on the Big Board outnumbered advancers , 975 to 749 , and the over-the-counter market that includes many smaller stocks suffered aftershocks of Friday 's late Big Board plunge . </s>
<s> The Nasdaq OTC index closed down 6.31 to 460.98 . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , in a divergence in two of the market 's most important indicators , the Dow industrials ' sister average , the 20-stock Dow Jones Transportation Average , tumbled 102.06 to 1304.23 -- its second-worst decline next to the 164.78-point fall during the 1987 crash . </s>
<s> Transports plunged on takeover disappointments in two airline stocks , UAL and AMR , which each fell more than 20 % when they reopened for trading yesterday after being suspended Friday afternoon . </s>
<s> UAL , the takeover stock at the center of Friday 's 190.58-point market plunge , fell 56 7\/8 to 222 7\/8 on nearly 2.3 million shares . </s>
<s> Overall , `` this is a pleasant rally but it 's very selective , '' said Arthur Cashin Jr. , a veteran PaineWebber Inc. trader at the Big Board . </s>
<s> `` Everyone was a little concerned about the general narrowness of the rally and failure of the OTC market to get into plus territory . </s>
<s> It 's just a strange feeling . </s>
<s> I do n't think anyone left the place whistling Dixie . '' </s>
<s> The rally gave credence , at least for now , to the pre-trading declaration of Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. that Friday 's market debacle was `` an abnormal condition , and not a disaster . '' </s>
<s> But to traders , it looked like disaster on the 9:30 a.m. opening bell . </s>
<s> The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened down 1.64 shortly after 9:30 . </s>
<s> But most of the 30 blue-chip stocks in the average , including Eastman Kodak and General Motors , could n't trade because of the heavy backlog of sell orders left over from Friday 's late-afternoon rout . </s>
<s> At 9:45 , Procter & Gamble -- one of the most important Dow bellwethers of late -- opened down 2 3\/4 to 117 . </s>
<s> The Dow dropped to a quick 27-point loss , and to many traders it looked as if stocks were headed for yet another big tumble . </s>
<s> More stocks opened over the ensuing half hour , as the 49 Big Board specialist firms in charge of keeping the market orderly groped to find buy orders from major brokerage firms to match the selling flood . </s>
<s> Then , to make matters worse , computerized sell programs kicked in , hammering stocks into steeper losses . </s>
<s> There was heavy stock-index arbitrage , as traders sold big baskets of stock and bought stock-index futures to profit from the price discrepancies between the two markets . </s>
<s> This was a hangover from Friday , when Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index futures had closed at a sharp discount to stocks . </s>
<s> The onslaught of the program selling dashed any hopes that some of the big program trading firms would hold off until the market stabilized . </s>
<s> They did n't . </s>
<s> The Dow accelerated its slide , losing 63.52 in the first 40 minutes of trading . </s>
<s> With program traders seemingly in charge , buyers backed away from the market and watched stocks fall . </s>
<s> Then at 10:15 the Dow suddenly started to rebound , and when it shot upward it did so even faster than the early-morning fall . </s>
<s> And this time , it was n't just the program traders who were responsible . </s>
<s> All the selling had pushed stocks to such cheap values that big investment banks and major money management firms started buying stocks heavily . </s>
<s> The program traders were in there , too , of course . </s>
<s> But according to one trader , the programmers `` did n't look as dominant on the upside as on the downside because there was -LCB- also -RCB- a lot of bargain-hunting '' by institutions . </s>
<s> Roland M. Machold , director of the New Jersey Division of Investment , which oversees $ 29 billion in investments , said the `` first thing we did was to double our orders '' yesterday morning . </s>
<s> `` With the market down like this , we 'll probably take another $ 50 million and put it in '' the market . </s>
<s> Trading in Walt Disney Co. particularly caught traders ' eyes . </s>
<s> According to Big Board officials , Disney had one of the biggest sell-order imbalances on Friday ; it was one of the seven stocks that could n't finish trading that day . </s>
<s> The stock opened late at 114 1\/2 , down 8 1\/2 . </s>
<s> But then it shot upward 7 1\/2 as Goldman , Sachs & Co. stepped in and bought , traders said . </s>
<s> However , Disney specialist Robert Fagenson said : `` I would be surprised if Goldman represented 4 % of the opening volume . '' </s>
<s> Around Wall Street , trading desks were relieved that they could at least play the market yesterday , in contrast to Friday 's gridlock . </s>
<s> At Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. , head equity trader Dudley Eppel said : `` I think the opening was constructive . </s>
<s> It was orderly . </s>
<s> We put some orders together . </s>
<s> There was n't a lot of panic selling , either domestically or internationally ... . </s>
<s> Not like Friday where they just took -LCB- the market -RCB- apart . '' </s>
<s> Still , the market had n't yet crossed into positive territory , and traders were glum . </s>
<s> But in another dramatic burst , the Dow tacked on 42 points in five minutes , and at 10:25 the index showed a gain of 5.74 . </s>
<s> On the Big Board floor and on trading desks , traders yelped their approval . </s>
<s> Grinned Griffith Peck , a trader in Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 's OTC department : `` I tell you , this market acts healthy . '' </s>
<s> Around him , scores of traders seemed to get a burst of energy ; their boss broke out bottles of Perrier water to cool them off . </s>
<s> Among Big Board specialists , the cry was `` Pull your offers '' -- meaning that specialists soon expected to get higher prices for their shares . </s>
<s> `` It was bedlam on the upside , '' said one Big Board specialist . </s>
<s> But not everybody was making money . </s>
<s> The carnage on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , the nation 's major options market , was heavy after the trading in S&P 100 stock-index options was halted Friday . </s>
<s> Many market makers in the S&P 100 index options contract had bullish positions Friday , and when the shutdown came they were frozen with huge losses . </s>
<s> Over the weekend , clearing firms told the Chicago market makers to get out of their positions at any cost Monday morning . </s>
<s> `` They were absolutely killed , slaughtered , '' said one Chicago-based options trader . </s>
<s> Some traders said that the closely watched Major Market Index , whose 20 stocks mimic the Dow industrials , did n't lead yesterday 's big rally . </s>
<s> James Gallagher , a partner at specialist Fowler & Rosenau , said , `` The difference between today and two years ago '' -- `` Terrible Tuesday , '' Oct. 20 , 1987 -- `` is that then we needed a savior to go into the Major Market Index , spend $ 2 million and get the program rally started . </s>
<s> This time -LCB- institutions -RCB- saw the programs coming and backed away and backed away . </s>
<s> Then when the market was at a technical level to buy , they came in with a vengeance . '' </s>
<s> However , according to one analyst , the timing of Major Market Index futures buying just before the turnaround was similar to that of Terrible Tuesday . </s>
<s> `` Futures were pulling the stock market higher , '' said Donald Selkin , head of stock-index futures research at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc . </s>
<s> Although the Big Board 's specialist firms struggled through another highly volatile trading session , their performance yesterday was better than during Friday 's late-afternoon chaos , according to traders and brokers who work with them . </s>
<s> Specialists were criticized for their inability to maintain orderly markets during the Friday plunge . </s>
<s> But yesterday , even with halts in such major blue-chip stocks as Merck , `` we expected -LRB- the halts -RRB- and it was n't too bad , '' said Donaldson 's Mr. Eppel , who had been critical of the specialists ' performance on Friday . </s>
<s> According to a Big Board official , while many stocks opened late , there were subsequent trading halts in only three issues -- AMR , Merck and Valero Energy . </s>
<s> Merck is one of the most important stocks in the Major Market Index . </s>
<s> No sector of the market has been spared during the past two days ' gyrations . </s>
<s> Yet from the Dow industrials ' high on Oct. 9 through Friday 's plunge , relatively good performances have been turned in by real-estate , utilities , precious metals and life insurance stocks . </s>
<s> And yesterday , the top performing industry group was oil field equipment issues . </s>
<s> For example , Halliburton jumped 3 1\/4 to 38 , Schlumberger rose 2 1\/2 to 43 1\/4 and Baker Hughes rose 1 1\/8 to 22 . </s>
<s> Because of the UAL and AMR tumbles , airlines were the weakest sector of the market yesterday . </s>
<s> Philip Morris was the Big Board 's most active issue , rising 2 1\/4 to 43 1\/4 on nearly eight million shares . </s>
<s> Among other major issues , Coca-Cola Co. closed up 2 at 66 3\/4 on 1.7 million shares and American Telephone & Telegraph rose 3 1\/4 to 43 on nearly 7.8 million shares . </s>
<s> Shares of International Business Machines , which reported earnings yesterday , finished at 103 , up 1 , after slipping below 100 during Friday 's session for the first time in five years . </s>
<s> Shares of three brokerage firms rose after they reported earnings . </s>
<s> Merrill Lynch added 1 3\/4 to 28 , PaineWebber rose 3\/4 to 18 1\/2 and Bear Stearns rose 3\/8 to 14 1\/4 . </s>
<s> Federal National Mortgage Association , a recently hot stock , climbed 4 to 124 on nearly 1.6 million shares . </s>
<s> At a news conference after the close of trading yesterday , the Big Board 's Mr. Phelan and other exchange officials praised the performance of their computers and personnel . </s>
<s> Mr. Phelan said that program trading strategies were n't responsible for triggering Friday 's decline despite a jump in the use of the computer-driven strategies in recent months . </s>
<s> Some 24 million of the more than 100 million shares traded in the final 90 minutes of Friday 's session , when the plunge in stock prices was concentrated , were program-related , he said . </s>
<s> Program trades make up 10 % of the exchange 's volume on an average day , but despite the increase Friday , it was `` certainly not something you would say precipitated the market decline , '' Mr. Phelan said . </s>
<s> Mr. Phelan expressed relief that the market rebounded yesterday . </s>
<s> `` Obviously , every time we get this kind of reaction , it 's going to make everybody nervous , including me , '' he said . </s>
<s> He said that exchange officials had conversations with Wall Street firms throughout the weekend and that `` all the participants behaved very , very responsibly today . '' </s>
<s> Meanwhile , Peter DaPuzzo , Shearson 's head of retail equity trading , praised institutional investors in the OTC market , who were heavy buyers of the Nasdaq 's biggest technology issues yesterday amid a flood of selling by other investors . </s>
<s> `` The institutions ca n't be criticized for their behavior , '' Mr. DaPuzzo said in an interview . </s>
<s> `` It was the opposite of what happened on Oct. 19 . </s>
<s> They used their judgment . </s>
<s> They did n't panic during the first round of selling this morning . </s>
<s> Instead , they bought on weakness and sold into the strength , which kept the market orderly . </s>
<s> Maybe they learned from experience . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Phelan said the performance of specialists during Friday 's plunge was admirable , because out of 1,640 Big Board common stocks traded during the day only seven were closed and were n't reopened before the close . </s>
<s> `` They did an excellent job , '' Mr. Phelan said of the specialists . </s>
<s> Wall Street traders on Friday had complained about the trading suspensions . </s>
