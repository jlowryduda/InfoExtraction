<s> Chicken Chains Ruffled By Loss of Customers </s>
<s> FAST-FOOD chicken chains , faced with a worsening business slump , are struggling to hatch some new marketing strategies . </s>
<s> The Crest Report , which tracks consumer purchases , says customer traffic at chicken restaurants fell 10 % in the second quarter , while the overall fast-food customer count was down 2 % . </s>
<s> Chicken business is off largely because of more competition from grocery-store convenience food , home-delivered pizza and other takeout fare , says a spokesman for the report , a publication of NPD Group , a market research firm in Port Washington , N.Y . </s>
<s> The loss of more customers is the latest in a string of problems . </s>
<s> Church 's Fried Chicken Inc. and Popeye 's Famous Fried Chicken Inc. , which have merged , are still troubled by overlapping restaurant locations . </s>
<s> Chicken chains also are feeling more pressure from McDonald 's Corp. , which introduced its McChicken sandwich this year and recently tested the sale of individual pieces of chicken . </s>
<s> New management at Kentucky Fried Chicken , a unit of PepsiCo Inc. , has fought back with new medium and large chicken sandwiches for the lunch crowd . </s>
<s> And the chain is testing products that are n't fried , such as `` char-grilled '' chicken , to try to win health-conscious consumers . </s>
<s> Kentucky Fried Chicken also is testing home-delivery of chicken , which could be a hit with stay-at-home diners . </s>
<s> But some fast-food industry analysts say problems with keeping chicken warm and fresh must be solved first . </s>
<s> A Kentucky Fried Chicken spokesman , however , disputed the notion that the delivery service experienced problems in some markets where testing has been discontinued . </s>
<s> He says the test is continuing in Chicago , Columbus , Ohio , and a few other cities . </s>
<s> The advertising industry is buzzing with rumors that Kentucky Fried Chicken will drop Young & Rubicam and seek a new ad agency . </s>
<s> But the company declines to comment . </s>
<s> Emanuel Goldman , a PaineWebber Inc. analyst , predicts Kentucky Fried Chicken will post an 11 % drop in 1989 net income . </s>
<s> `` They 've been laggard , '' he says , `` but they 'll have to become more aggressive . '' </s>
<s> Reluctant Advertisers Try Soft-Sell Spots </s>
<s> CALL IT un-advertising . </s>
<s> Pittsburgh consultant David Bear is selling a soft approach to clients who want exposure yet shun pushy ads . </s>
<s> His ploy : 60-second radio spots that offer helpful hints . </s>
<s> The only plug for the sponsor is a brief mention at the end of the spot . </s>
<s> The messages resemble the Business Traveler , a daily dose of travel tips developed by Mr. Bear and sponsored by travel agencies in several major cities . </s>
<s> New un-advertisers include Burt Hill Kosar Rittlemann Associates , a Butler , Pa. , architectural firm . </s>
<s> Its radio series features such spots as `` Floodlights : Evening Wear for Urban Structures '' and `` Building a Place to Park . '' </s>
<s> A harder sell , says John Kosar , the firm 's president , would `` detract from the profession . '' </s>
<s> Hospitals have signed up to use the messages to promote fundraisers , and Equitable Gas Co. is considering the format to offer energy tips to consumers . </s>
<s> But such spots can be too soft . </s>
<s> `` There 's always a risk of lost messages , '' says John Fitzgerald , chairman of Ketchum Advertising USA , which created similar radio spots for Pittsburgh National Bank . </s>
<s> `` It 's a question of how much credibility you gain for the possible loss of recognition . '' </s>
<s> Retailer Sees Pitfalls In Environmental Push </s>
<s> HERE 'S a retailer that 's getting tough in the push for environmentally safe packaging and products . </s>
<s> Big Bear Supermarkets Inc. , a grocery chain based in San Diego , plans to display shelf cards and distribute pamphlets recommending products deemed safe for the environment . </s>
<s> The choices will be based on research by the San Diego Environmental Health Coalition and will include products like Murphy 's Oil Soap and other noncorrosive cleaners . </s>
<s> But the chain is quickly realizing the pitfalls of such endorsements . </s>
<s> For example , it recommends nonchlorinated dishwasher detergent and puts Sunlight on its environmentally safe list . </s>
<s> That does n't thrill Procter & Gamble Co. , maker of Cascade dishwasher detergent . </s>
<s> A company spokesman questioned the validity of the list , noting that chlorine is present in all major dishwasher detergents . </s>
<s> In fact , Lever Bros. confirms that its Sunlight brand does contain chlorine bleach , even though it is n't listed on the label for the powder version . </s>
<s> Thomas G. Dahlen , Big Bear 's executive vice president , said the chain is still reviewing its product list to avoid such problems . </s>
<s> `` Our intent is to promote the best alternative , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` And it 's important that we be accurate . '' </s>
<s> But in the end , customers ' wishes are what will prevail . </s>
<s> Big Bear does n't care for disposable diapers , which are n't biodegradable . </s>
<s> Yet parents demand them . </s>
<s> Says Mr. Dahlen , `` We 'll still be forced to sell items we might not philosophically agree with . '' </s>
<s> Odds and Ends </s>
<s> NEATNESS does count -- at least in the grocery store . </s>
<s> A study by Safeway 's Scanner Marketing Research shows soap sales climbed 5 % when bars were neatly stacked on shelves instead of dumped in a wire basket ... . </s>
<s> Which celebrity endorsers are most believable ? </s>
<s> For the third year in a row , consumers voted Bill Cosby first and James Garner second in persuasiveness as spokesmen in TV commercials , according to Video Storyboard Tests , New York . </s>
<s> Michael J. Fox replaced Bruce Willis in third place ; Cher placed fourth for the second time . </s>
