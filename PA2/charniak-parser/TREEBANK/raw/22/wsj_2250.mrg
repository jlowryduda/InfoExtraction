<s> A. manual typewriters , B. black-and-white snapshots , C. radio adventure shows . </s>
<s> If you guessed black-and-white snapshots , you 're right . </s>
<s> After years of fading into the background , two-tone photography is coming back . </s>
<s> Trendy magazine advertisements feature stark black-and-white photos of Hollywood celebrities pitching jeans , shoes and liquor . </s>
<s> Portrait studios accustomed to shooting only in color report a rush to black-and-white portrait orders . </s>
<s> And black-and-white photography classes are crowded with students . </s>
<s> What 's happening in photography mirrors the popularity of black and white in fashion , home furnishings and cinematography . </s>
<s> On Seventh Avenue , designers have been advancing the monochrome look with clothing collections done entirely in black and white . </s>
<s> And classic black-and-white movies are enjoying a comeback on videocassette tapes , spurred , in part , by the backlash against colorization of old films . </s>
<s> `` The pendulum is swinging back to black and white , '' says Richard DeMoulin , the general manager of Eastman Kodak Co. 's professional photography division . </s>
<s> Until two years ago , sales of black-and-white film had been declining steadily since the 1960s . </s>
<s> But last year , buoyed by increased use in advertising and other commercial applications , sales increased 5 % , and they are expected to jump at least that much again this year . </s>
<s> Photographic companies are scrambling to tap the resurging market , reviving some black-and-white product lines and developing new ones . </s>
<s> At Kodak , which largely ignored the market for years , black-and-white film sales now account for nearly 15 % of the company 's $ 3 billion in film and paper sales annually , up from 10 % three years ago . </s>
<s> The Rochester , N.Y. , photographic giant recently began marketing T-Max 3200 , one of the fastest and most sensitive monochrome films . </s>
<s> Aimed at commercial photographers , the film can be used in very low light without sacrificing quality , says Donald Franz of Photofinishing Newsletter . </s>
<s> Also trying to snare a portion of the $ 2 billion-a-year industry is Agfa Corp. , a unit of Bayer AG . </s>
<s> Agfa recently signed Olympic gold medalist Florence Griffith-Joyner to endorse a new line of black-and-white paper that 's geared to consumers and will compete directly with Kodak 's papers . </s>
<s> Slated for market by the end of the year , the paper `` could have been introduced a long time ago but the market was n't there then , '' says an Agfa spokesman . </s>
<s> The biggest beneficiary of the black-and-white revival is likely to be International Paper Co. 's Ilford division , known in the industry for its premium products . </s>
<s> Sales of Ilford 's four varieties of black-and-white film this year are outpacing growth in the overall market , although the company wo n't say by exactly how much . </s>
<s> `` We hope the trend lasts , '' says Laurie DiCara , Ilford 's marketing communications director . </s>
<s> Why all the interest ? </s>
<s> For baby boomers who grew up being photographed in color , black and white seems eye-catching and exotic . </s>
<s> `` It has an archival , almost nostalgic quality to it , '' says Owen B. Butler , the chairman of the applied photography department at Rochester Institute of Technology . </s>
<s> `` You can shift out of reality with black and white , '' he adds . </s>
<s> Such features have been especially attractive to professional photographers and marketing executives , who have been steadily increasing their use of black and white in advertising . </s>
<s> Processing of black-and-white commercial film jumped 24 % last year to 18.7 million rolls . </s>
<s> Consider Gap Inc. , whose latest ad campaign features black-and-white shots of Hollywood stars , artists and other well-known personalities modeling the retailer 's jeans and T-shirts . </s>
<s> Richard Crisman , the account manager for the campaign , says Gap did n't intentionally choose black and white to distinguish its ads from the color spreads of competitors . </s>
<s> `` We wanted to highlight the individual , not the environment , '' he says , `` and black and white allows you to do that better than color . '' </s>
<s> The campaign won a Cleo award as this year 's best ad by a specialty retailer . </s>
<s> Even food products and automobiles , which have long depended on color , are making the switch . </s>
<s> Companies `` feel black and white will convey a stronger statement , '' says Marc L. Hauser , a Chicago photographer who is working on a black-and-white print ad for Stouffer Food Corp. 's Lean Cuisine . </s>
<s> Other companies that are currently using two-tone ads include American Express Co. and Epson America Inc . </s>
<s> Portrait studios have also latched onto the trend . </s>
<s> Using black and white , `` we can make housewives look like stars , '' says John Perrin . </s>
<s> His On-Broadway Photography studio in Portland , Ore. , doubled its business last year and , he says , is booked solid for the next five . </s>
<s> One customer , Dayna Brunsdon , says she spurned a color portrait for black and white because `` it 's more dramatic . </s>
<s> I show it to my friends , and they all say ` wow . ' </s>
<s> It is n't ordinary like color . '' </s>
<s> Still , most consumers are n't plunking black-and-white film into their cameras to take family snapshots . </s>
<s> One big obstacle is that few drugstores develop the film anymore . </s>
<s> Typically , it must be mailed to a handful of processors and may take a week or more to be processed and returned . </s>
<s> Black-and-white film costs consumers a little less than color film , and processing costs the same . </s>
<s> But for photofinishers , developing costs for black-and-white film are higher . </s>
<s> Some companies are starting to tackle that problem . </s>
<s> Ilford , for example , recently introduced a black-and-white film that can be processed quickly by color labs . </s>
<s> Intent on wooing customers , the company is also increasing its sponsorship of black-and-white photography classes . </s>
<s> Similarly , Agfa is sponsoring scores of photography contests at high schools and colleges , offering free black-and-white film and paper as prizes . </s>
<s> And Kodak is distributing an instructional video to processors on how to develop its monochrome film more efficiently . </s>
<s> Other companies are introducing related products . </s>
<s> Charles Beseler Co. , a leading maker of photographic enlargers , introduced last month a complete darkroom starter kit targeted at teen-agers who want to process their own black-and-white photographs . </s>
<s> The kit , which has a suggested retail price of $ 250 and has already become a bestseller , was introduced after retailers noticed numerous requests from parents for children 's photography equipment . </s>
<s> `` It seems computers as hobbies have waned , '' says Ian Brightman , Beseler 's chairman and chief executive officer . </s>
<s> But some industry observers believe the resurgence of black and white is only a fad . </s>
<s> They cite the emergence of still electronic photography , more newspapers turning to color on their pages and measurable improvements in the quality of color prints . </s>
<s> `` Black and white has n't made the same quantum leaps in technological development as color , '' says Mr. Butler of the Rochester Institute . </s>
<s> `` The color print today is far superior to prints of 10 years ago . </s>
<s> You ca n't say the same with black and white . '' </s>
<s> But when Popular Photography , a leading magazine for photographers , selected 15 of the greatest photos ever made for its latest issue celebrating photography 's 150th anniversary , all were black and white . </s>
<s> `` It 's got a classic spirit and carries over emotionally , '' says Alfred DeBat of Professional Photographers of America . </s>
<s> `` That 's the appeal . </s>
