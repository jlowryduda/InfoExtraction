<s> Share prices plummeted across Europe yesterday in response to Friday 's New York sell-off , but some issues staged a late comeback after Wall Street opened without another rout . </s>
<s> European investors have further reason for optimism today , after the U.S. rebound . </s>
<s> The Frankfurt Stock Exchange , which closed before the New York exchanges opened , was the hardest hit of the major European markets , with the DAX Index dropping 12.8 % . </s>
<s> In London , prices plummeted in early trading and were off as much as 9 % before coming back strong after the New York opening to close down only 3.2 % . </s>
<s> West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said , `` In my view , the stock market will stabilize relatively quickly . </s>
<s> There may be one or other psychological or technical reactions , but they are n't based on fundamentals . </s>
<s> The economy of West Germany and the EC -LCB- European Community -RCB- is highly stable . '' </s>
<s> Paris , which has been the center of speculation fever in recent weeks , also was hard hit . </s>
<s> Share prices fell in Milan , Amsterdam , Zurich , Madrid and Stockholm . </s>
<s> Prices in Brussels , where a computer breakdown disrupted trading , also tumbled . </s>
<s> Following is a breakdown of major market activity : </s>
<s> FRANKFURT : </s>
<s> One of the sharpest declines came in the financial center of Europe 's strongest economy . </s>
<s> The DAX Index of 30 West German blue chips plunged 12.8 % , a one-day record , wiping out the summer 's gains . </s>
<s> The index closed at 1385.72 , down 203.56 points . </s>
<s> By comparison , two years ago on Black Monday , the new index would have dropped 9.4 % , according to a projection by the exchange . </s>
<s> Investors may have reacted so strongly to Friday 's U.S. stock market loss because they had vivid memories of the Frankfurt exchange 's losing 35 % of its value in the 1987 crash and its wake . </s>
<s> This time , however , many small investors may have been hurt by acting so swiftly . </s>
<s> `` They all went in the wrong direction , '' said Andreas Insam , an investment adviser for the Bank in Liechtenstein 's Frankfurt branch . </s>
<s> He said he told clients to buy selected West German blue chips after they fell by about 10 % . </s>
<s> After the opening was delayed 30 minutes because of the crush of sell orders , Frankfurt 's normal two-hour trading session was extended 75 minutes to handle the heavy volume . </s>
<s> `` The beginning was chaotic , '' said Nigel Longley , a broker for Commerzbank AG . </s>
<s> `` It took three-quarters of an hour before enough prices could be worked out to get a reading on the market . '' </s>
<s> Institutional investors and bankers , many of whom spent the night before in their offices watching Far Eastern markets , were cautiously optimistic after the mild 1.8 % decline in Tokyo stock prices . </s>
<s> `` Everybody was still confident , including most institutional investors . </s>
<s> That is why everybody was a little surprised by the storm of sell orders from small private investors , '' said Norbert Braeuer , a senior trader for Hessische Landesbank . </s>
<s> Some big institutions , including banks , began picking up lower-priced shares late yesterday , but most investors wanted to see what would happen in New York before acting . </s>
<s> But even if Wall Street continues to stabilize , analysts here say the latest blow to investor confidence could inhibit a swift recovery for the Frankfurt exchange , which already was showing signs of weakness after the DAX had slipped from a 1989 high of 1657.61 on Sept. 8 . </s>
<s> Some of West Germany 's bluest chips took some of the biggest hits . </s>
<s> A 16.3 % drop for Mannesmann AG and Dresdner Bank AG 's 9.6 % decline were especially problematic for their respective boards , whose plans for major rights issues in November could now be in jeopardy . </s>
<s> Dresdner Bank last month said it hoped to raise 1.2 billion marks -LRB- $ 642.2 million -RRB- by issuing four million shares at 300 marks each . </s>
<s> Yet yesterday 's market cropped Dresdner 's share price by 33 marks to 309 marks a share , leaving little incentive for investors to subscribe to the standing price unless the market recovers quickly . </s>
<s> LONDON : </s>
<s> Headed toward a record drop at midday , the London stock market recouped two-thirds of its losses in the wake of New York 's early rally . </s>
<s> The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index closed off 70.5 points , at 2163.4 , its high for the day , after having plunged 204.2 points at 12:49 p.m . </s>
<s> It was big institutions such as Norwich Union Insurance Group , Scottish Amicable Investment Managers and Standard Life Assurance Co. that spearheaded the rally . </s>
<s> Attracted by low prices and encouraged by New York 's performance , they scooped up equities across the board . </s>
<s> Volume was 959.3 million shares , more than triple recent levels . </s>
<s> PARIS : </s>
<s> Late buying gave the Paris Bourse a parachute after its free fall early in the day . </s>
<s> The CAC General Index ended down 5.4 % at 523.6 , a drop of 29.6 points from Friday . </s>
<s> `` There was a volatility in the market that I have never seen before , '' said Michel Vigier , a partner in brokerage firm Cholet Dupont . </s>
<s> `` When Wall Street turned around shortly after the opening , there was panic buying in Paris . '' </s>
<s> Brokers said that as the news spread that Wall Street was moving up , traders who had called to place sell orders changed their line in mid-conversation , ordering buys instead . </s>
<s> Trading was driven primarily by small investors and speculators , with large institutions waiting on the sidelines until late in the day . </s>
<s> When Wall Street turned , however , the big boys entered the market , looking for bargains . </s>
