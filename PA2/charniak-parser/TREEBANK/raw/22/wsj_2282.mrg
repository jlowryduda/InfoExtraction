<s> Richard G. Sim , the man credited with transforming Applied Power Inc. from an underachiever into a feisty player in the global market for hydraulic tools , hopes to guide a similar turnaround at the company 's latest acquisition , Barry Wright Corp . </s>
<s> The 45-year-old former General Electric Co. executive figures it will be easier this time . </s>
<s> But analysts , while applauding the acquisition , say Applied 's chief executive faces a tough challenge in integrating the two companies . </s>
<s> Barry Wright , acquired by Applied for $ 147 million , makes computer-room equipment and vibration-control systems . </s>
<s> The Watertown , Mass. , company 's sales have been dormant and its profits have dropped . </s>
<s> Last year 's earnings of $ 1.3 million , including $ 815,000 from a restructuring gain , were far below the year-earlier $ 8.4 million . </s>
<s> Besides spurring Barry Wright 's sales , which were $ 201.7 million in 1988 , Mr. Sim must pare its costs and product line . </s>
<s> `` The question is how long it 's going to take Barry Wright to make a contribution , '' says F. John Mirek , an analyst at Blunt Ellis Loewi in Milwaukee . </s>
<s> The answer will help determine whether Applied continues to reach the ambitious goals set by Mr. Sim . </s>
<s> The Butler , Wis. , manufacturer went public at $ 15.75 a share in August 1987 , and Mr. Sim 's goal then was a $ 29 per-share price by 1992 . </s>
<s> Strong earnings growth helped achieve that price far ahead of schedule , in August 1988 . </s>
<s> The stock has since softened , trading around $ 25 a share last week and closing yesterday at $ 23.00 in national over-the-counter trading . </s>
<s> But Mr. Sim has set a fresh target of $ 50 a share by the end of </s>
<s> Reaching that goal , says Robert T. Foote , Applied 's chief financial officer , will require `` efficient reinvestment '' of cash by Applied and continuation of its healthy 19 % rate of return on operating capital . </s>
<s> In Barry Wright , Mr. Sim sees a situation `` very similar '' to the one he faced when he joined Applied as president and chief operating officer in 1985 . </s>
<s> Applied , then a closely held company , was stagnating under the management of its controlling family . </s>
<s> While profitable , it `` was n't growing and was n't providing a satisfactory return on invested capital , '' he says . </s>
<s> Mr. Sim is confident that the drive to dominate certain niche markets will work at Barry Wright as it has at Applied . </s>
<s> He also professes an `` evangelical '' fervor to develop a corporate culture that rewards managers who produce and where decision-making is shared . </s>
<s> Mr. Sim considers the new unit 's operations `` fundamentally sound '' and adds that Barry Wright has been fairly successful in moving into markets that have n't interested larger competitors . </s>
<s> `` With a little patience , these businesses will perform very satisfactorily , '' Mr. Sim says . </s>
<s> Within about six months , `` things will be moving in the right direction , '' he predicts . </s>
<s> Mr. Sim figures it will be easier to turn Barry Wright around since he 's now in the driver 's seat . </s>
<s> When he came to Applied , `` I did n't have the power to execute as I do today , '' he says . </s>
<s> He was named chief executive officer of Applied in 1986 and became chairman last November . </s>
<s> At Applied , Mr. Sim set growth as his first objective . </s>
<s> He took the company public in an offering that netted Applied about $ 12.6 million , which helped launch the company 's acquisition program . </s>
<s> Sales climbed to an estimated $ 245 million in fiscal 1989 , ended Aug. 31 , from $ 99.9 million in fiscal 1985 . </s>
<s> The company expects that earnings , which have marched steadily upward in recent years , reached about $ 20.8 million , or $ 1.58 a share , in the fiscal year just ended , up from $ 15.2 million in fiscal 1988 and $ 3.9 million in 1985 . </s>
