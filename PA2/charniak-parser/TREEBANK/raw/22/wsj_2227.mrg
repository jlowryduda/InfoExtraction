<s> The continuing series of HUD scandals is a sadly predictable result of pork-barrel politics . </s>
<s> Nevertheless , lobbies such as the National Association of Home Builders -LRB- NAHB -RRB- continue to pressure Capitol Hill for more special-interest spending . </s>
<s> Kent Colton , NAHB executive vice president , argues that the U.S. faces a multifaceted housing crisis -- reduced affordability of homes for first-time buyers , increased homelessness , and lower apartment construction rates -- that will be `` very difficult '' to solve `` without expanded federal resources . '' </s>
<s> There 's nothing unusual about business groups pushing for more government spending . </s>
<s> But the NAHB was created in 1943 out of an organization that made its name fighting a Roosevelt administration proposal to take over all defense housing production . </s>
<s> Through the years the association has been an active member of the taxpayer 's coalition , pushing for such initiatives as the balanced-budget amendment . </s>
<s> Yet on matters close to , er , home ... </s>
<s> `` The HUD budget has dropped by more than 70 % since 1980 , '' argues Mr. Colton . </s>
<s> `` We 've taken more than our fair share . </s>
<s> I would n't have a problem if other programs had taken a similar hit . '' </s>
<s> But NAHB support for subsidies is not related to the current housing crunch ; over the years the NAHB has backed a host of public programs . </s>
<s> It once pushed for a national housing production goal set by the federal government and has regularly advanced anti-recession housing measures . </s>
<s> Moreover , explains one HUD official , the NAHB remains susceptible to internal pressure from members that specialize in subsidized production . </s>
<s> The association is pushing an extensive and expensive wish-list , which would substantially boost spending above the current level of more than $ 15 billion annually . </s>
<s> It would like to peg the ceiling on Federal Housing Administration mortgage guarantees to 95 % of the median price in a particular market , instead of limiting it to $ 101,250 ; reduce -LRB- or even eliminate -RRB- FHA down-payment requirements and increase the availability of variable-rate mortgages ; expand the Veterans Affairs Department loan guarantee program ; provide `` adequate '' funding for the Farmers Home Administration -LRB- FmHA -RRB- ; increase federal funding and tax incentives for the construction of low-income and rental housing , including $ 4 billion in block grants to states and localities ; and `` fully fund '' the McKinney Act , a $ 656 million potpourri for the homeless . </s>
<s> Direct federal subsidies for housing construction have proved intolerably expensive in the past , and inevitably are twisted to the benefit of well-connected developers and lobbyists , as demonstrated by the ongoing HUD scandal , or congressmen . </s>
<s> Indirect subsidies , through the FHA , for instance , are little better . </s>
<s> Though Mr. Colton says expanding FHA lending would result in `` no cost to the government , '' the mere diversion of funds from other parts of the economy and from other forms of housing -LRB- such as low-income -RRB- to the single-family home market would result in a major expense . </s>
<s> More important , housing programs run by HUD , the VA , and FmHA are awash in red ink . </s>
<s> The FHA alone lost $ 4.2 billion in fiscal 1988 ; the government 's equity in the agency , essentially its reserve fund , fell to minus $ 2.9 billion . </s>
<s> The federal government has had to pump in $ 2.28 billion into the VA housing program since 1984 to keep the fund afloat and the VA requested an additional $ 120 million for the fiscal year just ended . </s>
<s> All told , the federal government already guarantees more than $ 900 billion of mortgages . </s>
<s> In its nicely produced publication `` Where Will Our Children Live ? '' the NAHB does acknowledge that `` of course , the full measure of housing affordability can not be provided by the federal government . '' </s>
<s> It points to the pernicious impact of local government regulation , particularly zoning and building fees , which pushes the price of housing out of the reach of low- and middle-income people . </s>
<s> But while the NAHB has suggested actions that states and localities should take to reduce regulatory barriers , the association has proposed no activist legislative program -- comparable to , say , its detailed request for more federal subsidies -- to eliminate counterproductive controls . </s>
<s> The association , a majority of whose 156,000 members build fewer than 25 units a year , is like many other business lobbies . </s>
<s> Explains Sheila MacDonald of the National Taxpayers Union : `` It treads in two worlds . </s>
<s> The builders like the subsidies , but at the same time they tend to be fiscal conservatives in terms of major issues , such as the balanced-budget amendment . '' </s>
<s> Unfortunately , the organization 's desire for pork tends to override its commitment to overall fiscal responsibility . </s>
<s> Two years ago when the NAHB lobbied for the $ 19 billion omnibus housing bill , the organization `` basically dropped out of the taxpayers ' coalition , '' says Ms. MacDonald . </s>
<s> As Mr. Colton of the NAHB acknowledges : `` Government is not going to solve the problem ... . </s>
<s> The real key is to have the economy working and interest rates down . '' </s>
<s> More money for HUD will increase the deficit and destabilize the economy ; more money to municipalities that are wrecking their local housing markets will further insulate them from the destructive effects of their policies . </s>
<s> Is this what the home builders want ? </s>
