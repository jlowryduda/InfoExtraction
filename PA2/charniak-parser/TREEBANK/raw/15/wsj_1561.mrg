<s> USX Corp. and its Japanese partner , Kobe Steel Ltd. , agreed to form a joint venture to build a new plant to produce hot-dipped galvanized sheet products , mainly for the automotive market . </s>
<s> Terms were n't disclosed for the plant , which will have annual capacity of 600,000 tons . </s>
<s> The move by the nation 's largest steelmaker follows a string of earlier announcements by other major steel companies . </s>
<s> Bethlehem Steel Corp. , LTV Corp. and Armco Inc. all have plans to build additional lines for such coated corrosion-resistant steel . </s>
<s> The surge in production , analysts say , raises questions about capacity outpacing demand . </s>
<s> They note that most of the new plants will come on line in 1992 , when the current import trade restraint program ends , which could result in more imports . </s>
<s> `` There 's too much capacity , '' contended Charles Bradford , an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets . </s>
<s> `` I do n't think there 's anyone not building one . '' </s>
<s> He does add , however , that transplanted Japanese car makers are boosting the levels of U.S.-made steel in their autos , instead of relying heavily on imported steel . </s>
<s> That trend could increase demand for hot-dipped galvanized sheet . </s>
<s> The hot-dipped galvanized segment is one of the fastest-growing and most profitable segments of the steel market , coveted by all major integrated steelmakers wanting to maintain an edge over smaller minimills and reconstructed mills -- those spun off to employees . </s>
<s> Indeed , USX said it expects the market for coated sheet steel to reach 12 million tons annually by 1992 , compared with 10.2 million tons shipped in 1988 . </s>
<s> For the first eight months of 1989 , analysts say shipments of hot-dipped galvanized steel increased about 8 % from a year earlier , while overall steel shipments were up only 2.4 % . </s>
<s> USX and Kobe Steel hope to reach a definitive agreement establishing the 50-50 partnership by the end of the year , with construction tentatively slated for the spring of 1990 and production by 1992 . </s>
<s> USX already has six lines in existing plants producing hot-dipped galvanized steel , but this marks the first so-called greenfield plant for such production . </s>
<s> Moreover , it will boost by 50 % USX 's current hot-dipped capacity of 1,275,000 tons . </s>
<s> The company said it does n't expect the new line 's capacity to adversely affect the company 's existing hot-dipped galvanizing lines . </s>
<s> Steelmakers have also been adding capacity of so-called electrogalvanized steel , which is another way to make coated corrosion-resistant steel . </s>
<s> One of the advantages of the hot-dipped process is that it allows the steel to be covered with a thicker coat of zinc more quickly . </s>
