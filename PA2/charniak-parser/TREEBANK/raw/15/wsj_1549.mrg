<s> In East Germany , where humor has long been the only way to express political criticism , they 're not laughing about their new leader Egon Krenz . </s>
<s> Mr. Krenz is such a contradictory figure that nobody has even come up with any good jokes about him . </s>
<s> `` You have to have clear feelings about someone before you can make jokes , '' says an East German mother of two who loves swapping political barbs with her friends . </s>
<s> `` With Krenz , we just do n't know what to expect . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Krenz does n't seem to be the knee-jerk hardliner many initially thought he was when the 52-year-old Politburo member was selected last week to succeed Erich Honecker . </s>
<s> But he does n't appear to be ready to make broad changes either . </s>
<s> According to East Germany 's ADN news agency , Mr. Krenz spoke to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev by telephone over the weekend and acknowledged East Germany could learn from Moscow 's glasnost policies . </s>
<s> Already last week , Mr. Krenz started overhauling East Germany 's heavily censored and notoriously boring news media . </s>
<s> On Thursday , a day after he took office , East German television broke into regular programming to launch a talk show in which viewers call in questions for a panel of officials to answer . </s>
<s> The regular nightly news program and daily newspapers are also getting a visible injection of Soviet-style glasnost . </s>
<s> `` It was quite a shock , '' says a 43-year-old East German shopkeeper . </s>
<s> `` For the first time in my life , I was n't sure whether I was listening to our news or West German television . '' </s>
<s> Other changes , including easing restrictions on travel for East Germans , are expected . </s>
<s> But whether such moves can win back the confidence of East Germans , who have taken to the streets by the thousands in recent weeks to demand democratic changes , depends largely on whether they feel they can trust Mr. Krenz . </s>
<s> And that 's a problem . </s>
<s> Mr. Krenz is not only closely identified with his mentor , Mr. Honecker , but also blamed for ordering violent police action against protesters this month and for praising China for sending tanks against student demonstrators . </s>
<s> `` I hope he grows with the job , '' says Rainer Eppelmann , a Protestant pastor in East Berlin . </s>
<s> `` The most important thing is that he have a chance . '' </s>
<s> Although Mr. Krenz is dedicated to East Germany 's conservative vein of communism , there is much about his style that sets him apart from his party comrades . </s>
<s> Unlike Mr. Honecker , who tended to lecture people about socialist values , Mr. Krenz enjoys asking questions . </s>
<s> Indeed , one of his first actions as leader was to visit a gritty machine factory on the outskirts of Berlin and wander among the workers -- a la Gorbachev . </s>
<s> He was later shown on television , fielding questions . </s>
<s> At one point , he asked a worker whether he thought East Germans were fleeing the country because of restrictive travel policies . </s>
<s> The worker 's tart reply : `` It 's more than just travel . </s>
<s> People have a sense the government is ignoring the real problems in our society . '' </s>
<s> The exchange was all the more remarkable in that authorities released television footage to Western news agencies . </s>
<s> This same tendency toward openness impressed a group of visiting U.S. congressmen this spring . </s>
<s> Rather than trying to `` lecture us , '' says one congressional aide who attended the two-hour meeting , Mr. Krenz `` wanted to listen . '' </s>
<s> Rep. Ronnie Flippo -LRB- D. , Ala. -RRB- , one of the members of the delegation , says he was particularly impressed by Mr. Krenz 's ready admission that East Germany needed to change . </s>
<s> `` He 's a very tough man , but one who 's also open to arguments , '' adds an aide to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl . </s>
<s> But there 's another side to Mr. Krenz . </s>
<s> Born in a Baltic town in an area which is now part of Poland , he has dedicated his life to the party apparatus . </s>
<s> He moved quickly through the ranks with the help of his patron , Mr. Honecker , and emerged as the heir apparent . </s>
<s> Barbara Donovan , an expert on East Germany at Radio Free Europe in Munich , says Mr. Krenz may project a smooth image , but she doubts he 's a true reformer . </s>
<s> Even if he is , she adds , he appears to have only limited room for maneuver within the Communist Party 's ruling Politburo . </s>
<s> Against this background , the new East German leader must move quickly to shore up his government 's standing . </s>
<s> The sudden growth of the opposition movement , together with the steady outflow of citizens escaping through Poland and Hungary , has plunged the country into its deepest political crisis since an anti-Soviet workers ' uprising in 1953 . </s>
<s> `` He does n't have any honeymoon period , '' says a Western diplomat based in East Berlin . </s>
<s> `` But if he 's sharp and quick , he has a chance . '' </s>
<s> The diplomat adds that Mr. Krenz has several things going for him . </s>
<s> The East German economy is strong compared with other East bloc nations . </s>
<s> And his relative youth could help him project a more vibrant image , contrasting with the perception of Mr. Honecker as an out-of-touch old man . </s>
<s> For average East Germans , Mr. Krenz remains a puzzle . </s>
<s> `` Either he was n't being real in the past , or he is n't being real right now , '' says a 30-year-old East German doctor . </s>
<s> `` Either way , I have a problem with how quickly he 's changed . '' </s>
<s> The doctor was among dozens of people milling through East Berlin 's Gethsemane Church Saturday morning . </s>
<s> The walls of the church are covered with leaflets , news clippings , and handwritten notes associated with the country 's political opposition . </s>
<s> `` I have to come here to read the walls , '' says the doctor , `` because it 's information I still ca n't get through the newspapers . '' </s>
<s> Meanwhile , East Germany 's growing openness may even allow the state-controlled news media to display a muted sense of humor . </s>
<s> Television last week carried a new report on East Berlin 's main wallpaper factory and the need to boost production . </s>
<s> East Germans remember a comment a few years ago by Kurt Hager , the government 's top ideologist , that just because a neighbor hangs new wallpaper , there 's no reason to change your own . </s>
<s> His point was there is no reason for East Germany to copy Soviet-style changes . </s>
<s> `` It 's hard to know whether it was intended to be funny , '' says the East Berlin shopkeeper , `` But everyone I know laughed about it . </s>
