<s> YOU WENT to college and thought you got an education . </s>
<s> Now you discover that you never learned the most important lesson : How to send your kids to college . </s>
<s> True , when you went to college , there was n't that much to learn . </s>
<s> Stick some money in an interest-bearing account and watch it grow . </s>
<s> Now , investment salesmen say it 's time to take some risks if you want the kind of returns that will buy your toddler a ticket to Prestige U. in 18 years . </s>
<s> In short , throw away the passbook and go for the glory . </s>
<s> The reason is cost . </s>
<s> Nothing in the annals of tuition readied parents for the 1980s . </s>
<s> Tuitions at private colleges rose 154 % in the 10 years ended in June of this year ; that 's twice the 77 % increase in consumer prices for the same period . </s>
<s> A year at Harvard now goes for $ 19,395 . </s>
<s> By 2007 , when this year 's newborns hit campus , a four-year Ivy League sheepskin will cost $ 300,000 , give or take a few pizzas-with-everything at exam time . </s>
<s> Stanford , MIT and other utmosts will cost no less . </s>
<s> So what 's a parent to do ? </s>
<s> Some investment advisers are suggesting , in effect , a bet on a start-up investment pool -- maybe even on margin . </s>
<s> Others prefer deep-discount zero-coupon bonds . </s>
<s> Still others say , Why not take a chance on a high-octane growth fund ? </s>
<s> `` You 're not going to make it in a 5 % bank account , '' says James Riepe , director of mutual funds at T. Rowe Price . </s>
<s> To get the necessary growth , adds Murray Ruffel , a marketing official at the Financial Programs mutual-fund group , `` you need to go to the stock market . '' </s>
<s> In other words , a little volatility never hurt . </s>
<s> It never hurt anyone , that is , unless the growth funds do n't grow when you need them to . </s>
<s> Or the zero-coupon bonds turn out not to have been discounted deeply enough to pay your kid 's tuition . </s>
<s> That 's the dilemma for today 's parent . </s>
<s> Although many experts are advising risk , no one has a good answer for you if the risk does n't pay off . </s>
<s> Help may be on the way . </s>
<s> The antitrust division of the Justice Department is investigating the oddly similar tuition charges and increases among the top schools . </s>
<s> Fear of the price police could help cool things off in the 1990s . </s>
<s> And then there 's always State U . </s>
<s> But parents ' craving for a top-rated education for their children is growing like their taste for fancy wheels and vintage wine . </s>
<s> Belatedly aware of public concern , lawmakers and financial middlemen are working overtime to create and sell college savings and investment schemes . </s>
<s> Their message , explicit or implicit , is that a good college will cost so much by whenever you want it that the tried and true wo n't do anymore . </s>
<s> Forget about Treasury bills or a money-market fund . </s>
<s> The latest wave of marketing is instructive . </s>
<s> Several outfits -- including the Financial Programs , Franklin , and T. Rowe Price mutual-fund groups and the Edward D. Jones brokerage house -- are advertising `` college planner '' tables and charts that tell you how much you need to put aside regularly . </s>
<s> The calculations generally rely on an after-tax rate of return of 8 % annually -- a rate historically obtainable by the individual in only one place , the stock market . </s>
<s> Most of the mailers are free , but Denver-based Financial Programs sells , for $ 15 , a version customized to the age of the child and the college of choice . </s>
<s> The figures are shocking . </s>
<s> To build a nest egg that would pay for Stanford when a current first-grader reaches college age , parents would need to set aside $ 773.94 a month -- for 12 years . </s>
<s> They can cut this to $ 691.09 a month if the investing keeps up through college . </s>
<s> And they can further reduce the monthly amount if they start saving earlier -- when mother and child come home from the hospital . </s>
<s> Plugging a cheaper college into the formulas still does n't generate an installment most people can live with . </s>
<s> Using a recent average private-school cost of about $ 12,500 a year , T. Rowe Price 's planner prescribes $ 450 monthly if the plan begins when the child is six . </s>
<s> Since the formula assumes an 8 % before-tax return in a mutual fund , there would also be $ 16,500 in taxes to pay over the 12 years . </s>
<s> Not everyone is so pessimistic . </s>
<s> `` People are basically peddling a lot of fear , '' says Arthur Hauptman , a consultant to the American Council on Education in Washington . </s>
<s> He takes issue with projections that do n't factor in students ' own contribution , which reduces most parents ' burden substantially . </s>
<s> Still , he says , `` it 's no bad thing '' if all the marketing prods people into putting aside a little more . </s>
<s> `` The situation you want to avoid is having somebody not save anything and hope they 'll be able to do it out of current income , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` That 's crazy . '' </s>
<s> His advice : Do n't panic . </s>
<s> Parents , he says , should aim at whatever regular investment sum they can afford . </s>
<s> Half the amount that the investment tables suggest might be a good goal , he adds . </s>
<s> That way , parents will reduce borrowings and outlays from current income when the time comes to pay tuition . </s>
<s> Mr. Hauptman reckons that the best investment choice is mutual funds because they are managed and over time have nearly kept up with the broad stock averages . </s>
<s> He favors either an all-stock fund or a balanced fund that mixes both stocks and bonds . </s>
<s> In their anxiety , however , parents and other student benefactors are flocking to new schemes . </s>
<s> They have laid out about $ 1 billion for so-called baccalaureate zero-coupon municipal bonds -- so far offered by Connecticut , Illinois , Virginia and eight other states . </s>
<s> And they have bought about $ 500 million in prepaid-tuition plans , offered in Michigan , Florida and Wyoming . </s>
<s> The prepaid plans take payment today -- usually at current tuitions or at a slight discount -- for a promise that tuition will be covered tomorrow . </s>
<s> The baccalaureate bonds -- tax-free , offered in small denominations and usually containing a provision that they wo n't be called before maturity -- seem to be tailor-made for college savers . </s>
<s> Like other zeros , they pay all their interest at maturity , meaning that buyers can time things so that their bonds pay off just when Junior graduates from high school . </s>
<s> Their compounding effect is also alluring . </s>
<s> In June , Virginia sold bonds for $ 268.98 that will pay $ 1,000 in 2009 . </s>
<s> But Richard Anderson , head of the Forum for College Financing Alternatives , at Columbia University , a research group partly financed by the federal government , says zeros are particularly ill-suited . </s>
<s> Their price falls further than that of other bonds when inflation and interest rates kick up . </s>
<s> That wo n't matter if they are held to maturity , but if , for any reason , the parents need to sell them before then , there could be a severe loss of principal . </s>
<s> Had zeros been available in 1972 and had parents bought a face amount equal to four years ' tuition at the time , aiming for their children 's 1988 enrollment , they would have been left with only enough to pay for two years , Mr. Anderson figures . </s>
<s> Most other bonds , however , would probably not have fared much better . </s>
<s> The prepaid plans may be a good bet , provided the guarantee of future tuition is secure . </s>
<s> Issuing states generally limit the guarantees to in-state institutions , however , and buyers get refunds without much interest if the children do n't attend the specified schools . </s>
<s> Two private groups are seeking Securities and Exchange Commission approval for plans that could be more broadly transferable . </s>
<s> Mr. Anderson wants the prestige colleges to sponsor such a plan . </s>
<s> The issue here may be the soundness of the guarantee . </s>
<s> Prepayments , much like mutual-fund purchases , are pooled for investment . </s>
<s> Sponsors are naturally counting on their ability to keep ahead of tuition inflation with investment returns . </s>
<s> But buyers are essentially betting on a start-up investment fund with no track record -- and some have been encouraged to borrow to do so . </s>
<s> One problem is that the Internal Revenue Service has decided that the investment earnings and gains of the sponsors ' funds are taxable . </s>
<s> The colleges , as educational institutions , had hoped that would n't be the case . </s>
<s> Based on historical rates of return , Mr. Anderson reckons a 100 % stock portfolio , indexed to the market , would have kept up with tuition and taxes in the 20th century . </s>
<s> But sponsors might not pick the stocks that will match the market . </s>
<s> And they 're leaning more toward fixed income , whose returns after tax have trailed tuition increases . </s>
<s> `` I 'm not sure they 're going to make it work , '' says Mr. Anderson . </s>
<s> What happens if the sponsors do n't have the cash to pay the tuitions ? </s>
<s> Florida and Wyoming have backed up their guarantees with the full faith and credit of the state governments , meaning that taxpayers will pick up any slack . </s>
<s> Not so Michigan . </s>
<s> Its plan is set up as an independent agency . </s>
<s> The state says there 's no worry -- investment returns , combined with fees and the gains from unused plans , will provide all the cash it needs . </s>
<s> Mr. Putka covers education from The Wall Street Journal 's Boston bureau . </s>
<s> If you start saving for your child 's eduction on Jan. 1 , 1990 , here 's the monthly sum you will need to invest to pay for four years at Yale , Notre Dame and University of Minnesota . </s>
<s> Figures assume a 7 % annual rise in tuition , fees , room and board and an 8 % annual investment return . </s>
