<s> If you think you have stress-related problems on the job , there 's good news and bad news . </s>
<s> You 're probably right , and you are n't alone . </s>
<s> A new Gallup Poll study commissioned by the New York Business Group on Health , found that a full 25 % of the work force at companies may suffer from anxiety disorders or a stress-related illness , with about 13 % suffering from depression . </s>
<s> The study surveyed a national group of medical directors , personnel managers and employee assistance program directors about their perceptions of these problems in their companies . </s>
<s> It is one of a series of studies on health commissioned by the New York Business Group , a non-profit organization with about 300 members . </s>
<s> The stress study was undertaken because problems related to stress `` are much more prevalent than they seem , '' said Leon J. Warshaw , executive director of the business group . </s>
<s> In presenting the study late last week , Dr. Warshaw estimated the cost of these types of disorders to business is substantial . </s>
<s> Occupational disability related to anxiety , depression and stress costs about $ 8,000 a case in terms of worker 's compensation . </s>
<s> In terms of days lost on the job , the study estimated that each affected employee loses about 16 work days a year because of stress , anxiety or depression . </s>
<s> He added that the cost for stress-related compensation claims is about twice the average for all injury claims . </s>
<s> `` We hope to sensitize employers '' to recognize the problems so they can do something about them , Dr. Warshaw said . </s>
<s> Early intervention into these types of problems can apparently save businesses long-term expense associated with hospitalization , which sometimes results when these problems go untreated for too long . </s>
<s> Even the courts are beginning to recognize the link between jobs and stress-related disorders in compensation cases , according to a survey by the National Council on Compensation Insurance . </s>
<s> But although 56 % of the respondents in the study indicated that mental-health problems were fairly pervasive in the workplace , there is still a social stigma associated with people seeking help . </s>
<s> The disorders , which 20 years ago struck middle-age and older people , `` now strike people at the height of productivity , '' says Robert M.A. Hirschfeld , of the National Institute of Mental Health , who spoke at the presentation of the study 's findings . </s>
<s> The poll showed that company size had a bearing on a manager 's view of the problem , with 65 % of those in companies of more than 15,000 employees saying stress-related problems were `` fairly pervasive '' and 55 % of those in companies with fewer than 4,000 employees agreeing . </s>
<s> The poll also noted fear of a takeover as a stress-producing event in larger companies . </s>
<s> More than eight in 10 respondents reported such a stress-provoking situation in their company . </s>
<s> Mid-sized companies were most affected by talk of layoffs or plant closings . </s>
<s> The study , which received funding from Upjohn Co. , which makes several drugs to treat stress-related illnesses , also found 47 % of the managers said stress , anxiety and depression contribute to decreased production . </s>
<s> Alcohol and substance abuse as a result of stress-related problems was cited by 30 % of those polled . </s>
<s> Although Dr. Warshaw points out that stress and anxiety have their positive uses , `` stress perceived to be threatening implies a component of fear and anxiety that may contribute to burnout . '' </s>
<s> He also noted that various work environments , such as night work , have their own `` stressors . '' </s>
<s> `` We all like stress , but there 's a limit , '' says Paul D'Arcy , of Rohrer , Hibler & Replogle , a corporate psychology and management consulting firm . </s>
<s> The problem , says Mr. D'Arcy , a psychologist , is that `` it 's very hard to get any hard measures on how stress affects job performance . </s>
