<s> IN SIZING UP the risks of stock-market investments , there 's probably no starting place better than `` beta . '' </s>
<s> But investors better not ignore its limitations , either . </s>
<s> Beta is a handy gauge that measures the volatility of a stock or stock mutual fund . </s>
<s> For any given move in the overall market , it suggests how steeply that particular issue might rise or fall . </s>
<s> Beta figures are widely available and easy to interpret . </s>
<s> The beta of the broad market , typically defined as the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index , is always 1.0 . </s>
<s> So a stock with a beta of 0.5 is half as volatile , one at 1.5 is 50 % more volatile , and so on . </s>
<s> Cautious investors should generally go with stocks that have low betas . </s>
<s> Go with high-beta stocks to get the biggest payoff from a bet on a bull market . </s>
<s> Remember , though , that beta also has important limitations . </s>
<s> `` Beta is only part of the risk in a stock , '' says William F. Sharpe , the Stanford University emeritus professor who developed the measure . </s>
<s> `` There is risk that is not associated with market moves , and the beta does n't tell you the magnitude of that . '' </s>
<s> In particular , beta does n't measure the company - and industry-specific risk associated with an individual stock . </s>
<s> That `` business '' risk is very significant for an investor with only a few stocks , but it virtually disappears in a large and well-diversified portfolio . </s>
<s> Beta is also a poor indicator of the risk in stock groups that march to their own drummer . </s>
<s> In particular , the prices of gold and other precious-metals stocks shoot up and down , but the stocks tend to have low betas because their moves are not market-inspired . </s>
<s> Concern that investors could misinterpret such readings led the American Association of Individual Investors to eliminate beta figures for precious-metals funds in the 1989 edition of its mutual-fund guide . </s>
<s> `` Our fear was people would look just at the beta -LCB- of a gold fund -RCB- and say here is an investment with very low risk , '' says John Markese , director of research for the Chicago-based group . </s>
<s> `` In reality it 's very volatile , but the movements are not because of market movements . </s>
