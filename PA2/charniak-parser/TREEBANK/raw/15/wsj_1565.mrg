<s> A letter from Senator John Kerry chides us today for implying that he had `` flip-flopped '' on Manuel Noriega . </s>
<s> He correctly says he has been down on Noriega for some time , hence his criticism of administration mishandling of the attempted coup . </s>
<s> Our October 12 editorial should have been more precise . </s>
<s> It meant to convey our hope that the Senator and other members of the congressional left are broadening their dislike of Noriega to include other notorious Central American drug runners . </s>
<s> The Sandinistas of Nicaragua , for example , also are part of the Castro-Medellin cartel nexus . </s>
<s> In his letter and on the basis of his losing vote Tuesday against U.S. aid for the Nicaraguan opposition , Senator Kerry makes clear he has not made that intellectual leap . </s>
<s> We were wrong . </s>
