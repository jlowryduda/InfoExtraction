<s> Regarding the Oct. 3 letter to the editor from Rep. Tom Lantos , chairman of the House Subcommittee on Employment and Housing , alleging : </s>
<s> 1 . That your Sept. 28 editorial `` Kangaroo Committees '' was factually inaccurate and deliberately misleading . </s>
<s> I thought your editorial was factually accurate and deliberately elucidative . </s>
<s> 2 . That Mr. Lantos supported the rights of the witnesses to take the Fifth Amendment . </s>
<s> Yes , he did . </s>
<s> As I watched him on C-Span , I heard him speak those lovely words about the Bill of Rights , which he quotes from the transcript of the hearings . </s>
<s> He did repeat those nice platitudes several times as an indication of his support for the Constitution . </s>
<s> He used about 56 words defending the witnesses ' constitutional rights . </s>
<s> Unfortunately , by my rough guess , he used better than 5,000 words heaping scorn on the witnesses for exercising the Fifth . </s>
<s> He sandwiched his praise of constitutional meat between large loaves of bilious commentary . </s>
<s> As your editorial rightly pointed out , Samuel Pierce , former HUD secretary , and Lance Wilson , Mr. Pierce 's former aide , `` are currently being held up to scorn for taking the Fifth Amendment . </s>
<s> '' That certainly is not the supposed `` distorted reading '' indicated by Mr. Lantos . </s>
<s> 3 . That his `` committee does not deal with any possible criminal activity at HUD . </s>
<s> My colleagues and I fully realize we are not a court ... etc . '' </s>
<s> Absolute rubbish . </s>
<s> By any `` reasonable man '' criterion , Mr. Lantos and his colleagues have a whole bunch of people tried and convicted . </s>
<s> Apparently , their verdict is in . </s>
<s> Right now they 're pursuing evidence . </s>
<s> That 's not a bad way to proceed , just somewhat different from standard American practice . </s>
<s> How was that practice referred to when I was in school ? </s>
<s> Ah , yes , something called a Star Chamber . </s>
<s> Of course , Mr. Lantos doth protest that his subcommittee simply seeks information for legislative change . </s>
<s> No doubt that 's partially true . </s>
<s> Everything that Mr. Lantos says in his letter is partially true . </s>
<s> He 's right about his subcommittee 's responsibilities when it comes to obtaining information from prior HUD officials . </s>
<s> But if his explanation of motivation is true , why is his investigation so oriented as to identify criminal activity ? </s>
<s> Why not simply questions designed to identify sources and causes of waste and inefficiency ? </s>
<s> Such as , what happened when Congress wanted to know about $ 400 toilet seats or whatever they supposedly cost ? </s>
<s> No , Mr. Lantos 's complaints simply wo n't wash . </s>
<s> 4 . That the Journal defends `` the sleaze , fraud , waste , embezzlement , influence-peddling and abuse of the public that took place while Mr. Pierce was secretary of HUD , '' etc. and so forth . </s>
<s> No , to my mind , the Journal did not `` defend sleaze , fraud , waste , embezzlement , influence-peddling and abuse of the public trust ... '' </s>
<s> it defended appropriate constitutional safeguards and practical common sense . </s>
<s> The problem , which the Journal so rightly pointed out in a number of articles , is not the likes of Mr. Lantos , who after all is really a bit player on the stage , but the attempt by Congress to enhance itself into a quasi-parliamentary\/judicial body . </s>
<s> -LRB- Of course , we 've also got a judiciary that seeks the same objective . -RRB- </s>
<s> The system is the problem , not an individual member . </s>
<s> Individuals can always have their hands slapped . </s>
<s> It 's when such slapping does n't occur that we 've got trouble . </s>
<s> I do not by any means defend HUD management . </s>
<s> But I think the kind of congressional investigation that has been pursued is a far greater danger to American notions of liberty and freedom than any incompetency -LRB- and , yes , maybe criminality -RRB- within HUD could possibly generate . </s>
<s> The last time I saw a similar congressional hearing was when `` Tail Gunner Joe '' McCarthy did his work . </s>
<s> Raymond Weber </s>
<s> Parsippany , N.J . </s>
<s> I disagree with the statement by Mr. Lantos that one should not draw an adverse inference against former HUD officials who assert their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination in congressional hearings . </s>
<s> The Fifth Amendment states in relevant part that no person `` shall be compelled , in any criminal case , to be a witness against himself . '' </s>
<s> This privilege against self-incrimination precludes the drawing of an adverse inference against a criminal defendant who chooses not to testify . </s>
<s> Thus , in a criminal case , a prosecutor can not comment on a defendant 's failure to testify nor can the defendant be compelled to take the stand as a witness , thus forcing him to `` take the Fifth . '' </s>
<s> The privilege , however , has been limited in accordance with its plain language to protect the defendant in criminal matters only . </s>
<s> The Supreme Court and some states have specifically recognized that `` the Fifth Amendment does not preclude the inference where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause . '' </s>
<s> Baxter v. Palmingiano , 425 U.S. 308 -LRB- 1976 -RRB- . </s>
<s> Thus , in a civil case , a defendant may be called as a witness , he may be forced to testify or take the Fifth , and his taking of the Fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter . </s>
<s> He may take the Fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution . </s>
<s> Allowing the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony harms him in the civil matter , but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution . </s>
<s> Absent the risk of such prosecution , a court may order the defendant to testify . </s>
<s> Thus , when Mr. Pierce asserted the Fifth in a noncriminal proceeding , particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel , one must conclude that he held a good-faith , justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution . </s>
<s> The subcommittee , Congress and the American public have every right to draw the adverse inference and to concur with Mr. Pierce 's own belief that his testimony could help convict him of a crime . </s>
<s> Drawing the adverse inference in a noncriminal congressional hearing does not offend the Fifth Amendment shield against self-incrimination . </s>
