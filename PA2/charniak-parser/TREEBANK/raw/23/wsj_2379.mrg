<s> reminiscent of those during the 1987 crash -- that as stock prices plummeted and trading activity escalated , some phone calls to market makers in over-the-counter stocks went unanswered . </s>
<s> `` We could n't get dealers to answer their phones , '' said Robert King , senior vice president of OTC trading at Robinson-Humphrey Co. in Atlanta . </s>
<s> `` It was -LCB- like -RCB- the Friday before Black Monday '' two years ago . </s>
<s> Whether unanswered phone calls had any effect or not , Nasdaq stocks sank far less than those on the New York and American exchanges . </s>
<s> Nonetheless , the Nasdaq Composite Index suffered its biggest point decline of the year and its sixth worst ever , diving 14.90 , or 3 % , to 467.29 . </s>
<s> Ten points of the drop occurred during the last 45 minutes of trading . </s>
<s> By comparison , the New York Stock Exchange Composite tumbled 5.8 % Friday and the American Stock Exchange Composite fell 4 % . </s>
<s> On Oct. 16 , 1987 , the Nasdaq Composite fell 16.18 points , or 3.8 % , followed by its devastating 46.12-point , or 11 % slide , three days later . </s>
<s> Nasdaq volume Friday totaled 167.7 million shares , which was only the fifth busiest day so far this year . </s>
<s> The single-day record of 288 million shares was set on Oct. 21 , </s>
<s> `` There was n't a lot of volume because it was just impossible to get stock moved , '' said E.E. `` Buzzy '' Geduld , president of Herzog , Heine , Geduld , a New York company that makes markets in thousands of OTC issues . </s>
<s> Most of the complaints about unanswered phone calls came from regional brokers rather than individual investors . </s>
<s> Mr. King of Robinson-Humphrey and others were quick to add that they believe the problem stemmed more from traders ' inability to handle the volume of calls , rather than a deliberate attempt to avoid making trades . </s>
<s> The subject is a sore one for Nasdaq and its market-making companies , which were widely criticized two years ago following complaints from investors who could n't reach their brokers or trade in the chaos of the crash . </s>
<s> Peter DaPuzzo , head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton , declared : `` It was the last hour of trading on a Friday . </s>
<s> There were too many phones ringing and too many things happening to expect market makers to be as efficient as robots . </s>
<s> It was n't intentional , we were all busy . '' </s>
<s> James Tarantino , head of OTC trading at Hambrecht & Quist in San Francisco , said , `` It was just like two years ago . </s>
<s> Everybody was trying to do the same thing at the same time . '' </s>
<s> Jeremiah Mullins , the OTC trading chief at Dean Witter Reynolds in New York , said proudly that his company executed every order it received by the close of trading . </s>
<s> But , he added , `` you can only take one call at a time . '' </s>
<s> Market makers keep supplies of stock on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur . </s>
<s> On days like Friday , that means they must buy shares from sellers when no one else is willing to . </s>
<s> When selling is so frenzied , prices fall steeply and fast . </s>
<s> Two years ago , faced with the possibility of heavy losses on the stocks in their inventories , market makers themselves began dumping shares , exacerbating the slide in OTC stock prices . </s>
<s> On Friday , some market makers were selling again , traders said . </s>
<s> But , with profits sagging on Wall Street since the crash , companies have kept smaller share stockpiles on hand . </s>
<s> Mr. Tarantino of Hambrecht & Quist said some prices fell without trades taking place , as market makers kept dropping the prices at which they would buy shares . </s>
<s> `` Everyone was hitting everyone else 's bid , '' he said . </s>
<s> So , while OTC companies incurred losses on Friday , trading officials said the damage was n't as bad as it was in 1987 . </s>
<s> `` Two years ago we were carrying huge inventories and that was the big culprit . </s>
<s> I do n't know of anyone carrying big inventories now , '' said Mr. King of Robinson-Humphrey . </s>
<s> Tony Cecin , head of equity trading at Piper , Jaffray & Hopwood in Minneapolis , said that Piper Jaffray actually made money on Friday . </s>
<s> It helped that his inventory is a third smaller now than it was two years ago , he said . </s>
<s> Joseph Hardiman , president of the National Association of Securities Dealers , which oversees the Nasdaq computerized trading system , said that despite the rush of selling , he never considered the situation an `` emergency . '' </s>
<s> `` The pace of trading was orderly , '' he said . </s>
<s> Nasdaq 's Small Order Execution System `` worked beautifully , '' as did the automated system for larger trades , according to Mr. Hardiman . </s>
<s> Nevertheless , the shock of another steep plunge in stock prices undoubtedly will shake many investors ' confidence . </s>
<s> In the past , the OTC market thrived on a firm base of small-investor participation . </s>
<s> Because Nasdaq 's trading volume has n't returned to pre-crash levels , traders and OTC market officials hope the damage wo n't be permanent . </s>
<s> But they are worried . </s>
<s> `` We were just starting to get the public 's confidence back , '' lamented Mr. Mullins of Dean Witter . </s>
<s> More troubling is the prospect that the overall collapse in stock prices could permanently erode the base of small-investor support the OTC market was struggling to rebuild in the wake of the October 1987 crash . </s>
<s> Mr. Cecin of Piper Jaffray says some action from government policy makers would allay investor fears . </s>
<s> It wo n't take much more to `` scare the hell out of retail investors , '' he says . </s>
<s> The sellers on Friday came from all corners of the OTC market -- big and small institutional investors , as well as individual investors and market makers . </s>
<s> But grateful traders said the sell orders generally ranged from 20,000 shares to 50,000 shares , compared with blocks of 500,000 shares or more two years ago . </s>
<s> Shearson 's Mr. DaPuzzo said retail investors nervously sold stock Friday and never returned to bargain-hunt . </s>
<s> Institutional investors , which had been selling stock throughout last week to lock in handsome gains made through the third quarter , were calmer . </s>
<s> `` We had a good amount of selling from institutions , but not as much panic , '' Mr. DaPuzzo said . </s>
<s> `` If they could n't sell , some of them put the shares back on the shelf . '' </s>
<s> In addition , he said , some bigger institutional investors placed bids to buy some OTC stocks whose prices were beaten down . </s>
<s> In addition , Mr. DaPuzzo said computer-guided program selling of OTC stocks in the Russell Index of 2000 small stocks and the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock Index sent occasional `` waves `` through the market . </s>
<s> Nasdaq 's biggest stocks were hammered . </s>
<s> The Nasdaq 100 Index of the largest nonfinancial issues , including the big OTC technology issues , tumbled 4.2 % , or 19.76 , to 449.33 . </s>
<s> The Nasdaq Financial Index of giant insurance and banking stocks dropped 2 % , or 9.31 , to 462.98 . </s>
<s> The OTC market has only a handful of takeover-related stocks . </s>
<s> But they fell sharply . </s>
<s> McCaw Cellular Communications , for instance , has offered to buy LIN Broadcasting as well as Metromedia 's New York City cellular telephone interests , and in a separate transaction , sell certain McCaw properties to Contel Cellular . </s>
<s> McCaw lost 8 % , or 3 1\/2 , to 40 . </s>
<s> LIN Broadcasting , dropped 5 1\/2 , or 5 % , to 107 1\/2 . </s>
<s> The turnover in both issues was roughly normal . </s>
<s> On a day when negative takeover-related news did n't sit well with investors , Commercial Intertech , a maker of engineered metal parts , said Haas & Partners advised it that it does n't plan to pursue its previously reported $ 27.50-a-share bid to buy the company . </s>
<s> Commercial Intertech plummeted 6 to 26 . </s>
<s> The issues of companies with ties to the junk bond market also tumbled Friday . </s>
<s> On the OTC market , First Executive , a big buyer of the high-risk , high-yield issues , slid 2 to 12 1\/4 . </s>
<s> Among other OTC issues , Intel , dropped 2 1\/8 to 33 7\/8 ; Laidlaw Transportation lost 1 1\/8 to 19 1\/2 ; the American depositary receipts of Jaguar were off 1\/4 to 10 1\/4 ; MCI Communications slipped 2 1\/4 to 43 1\/2 ; Apple Computer fell 3 to 45 3\/4 and Nike dropped 2 1\/4 to 66 3\/4 . </s>
