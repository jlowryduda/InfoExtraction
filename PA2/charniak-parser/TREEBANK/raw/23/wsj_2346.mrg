<s> The real estate slump that 's pushing down the price of New York office space and housing is also affecting the city 's retail real estate market . </s>
<s> In Manhattan , once-desirable store sites sit vacant and newly constructed space has been slow to fill . </s>
<s> Retail real estate brokers say tenants are reluctant to sign leases because of uncertainty about the local economy , turmoil in their own industries and a belief that rents have not yet hit bottom . </s>
<s> `` There is an unbelievable amount of space available , '' says Faith Consolo , senior vice president at Garrick-Aug Associates Store Leasing Inc . </s>
<s> There are about 2,000 stores for rent , up from a more typical range of 1,200 to 1,500 . </s>
<s> `` This further confuses retailers , '' she says . </s>
<s> `` They wonder should they sign a lease if prices are still coming down ? </s>
<s> Is this the wrong time to open a store ? </s>
<s> Who is going to be in the space next door ? '' </s>
<s> In addition , Ms. Consolo says , tenants usually can negotiate to pay rents that are about one-quarter lower than landlords ' initial asking price . </s>
<s> A handful of hot retail locations , such as the 57th Street and Madison and Fifth Avenue areas , have been able to sustain what many see as astronomical rents . </s>
<s> And , in some neighborhoods , rents have merely hit a plateau . </s>
<s> But on average , Manhattan retail rents have dropped 10 % to 15 % in the past six months alone , experts say . </s>
<s> That follows a more subtle decline in the prior six months , after Manhattan rents had run up rapidly since 1986 . </s>
<s> The same factors limiting demand for office space have affected retailing . </s>
<s> `` As businesses contract or depart , the number of employees who might use retail services shrinks , '' says Edward A. Friedman , senior vice president of Helmsley Spear Inc . </s>
<s> He says financial problems plaguing electronics , fur and furniture companies -- key categories in the local retail economy -- have further deflated the market . </s>
<s> Hardest hit are what he calls `` secondary '' sites that primarily serve neighborhood residents . </s>
<s> In these locations , Mr. Friedman says , `` Retailers are increasingly cautious about expanding and rents have remained steady or in some cases have declined . '' </s>
<s> Weakness in the restaurant industry , which is leaving retail space vacant , exacerbates the problem for landlords . </s>
<s> It is also no comfort to landlords and small New York retailers when the future of larger department stores , which anchor retail neighborhoods , are in doubt . </s>
<s> Hooker Corp. , parent of Bonwit Teller and B. Altman 's , is mired in bankruptcy proceedings and Bloomingdale 's is for sale by its owner , Campeau Corp . </s>
<s> The trend toward lower rents may seem surprising given that some communities in New York are bemoaning the loss of favorite local businesses to high rents . </s>
<s> But , despite the recent softening , for many of these retailers there 's still been too big a jump from the rental rates of the late 1970s , when their leases were signed . </s>
<s> Certainly , the recent drop in prices does n't mean Manhattan comes cheap . </s>
<s> New York retail rents still run well above the going rate in other U.S. cities . </s>
<s> Madison and Fifth Avenues and East 57th Street can command rents of up to $ 500 a square foot , and $ 250 is not uncommon . </s>
<s> The thriving 34th Street area offers rents of about $ 100 a square foot , as do up-and-coming locations along lower Fifth Avenue . </s>
<s> By contrast , rentals in the best retail locations in Boston , San Francisco and Chicago rarely top $ 100 a square foot . </s>
<s> And rents on Beverly Hills ' Rodeo Drive generally do n't exceed about $ 125 a square foot . </s>

<s> It makes investment castings and has traded over-the-counter . </s>
<s> Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC , an Edinburgh , Scotland , financial services company , will list American depositary shares , representing preferred shares , with the symbol RBSPr . </s>
