<s> No , it was n't Black Monday . </s>
<s> But while the New York Stock Exchange did n't fall apart Friday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 190.58 points -- most of it in the final hour -- it barely managed to stay this side of chaos . </s>
<s> Some `` circuit breakers '' installed after the October 1987 crash failed their first test , traders say , unable to cool the selling panic in both stocks and futures . </s>
<s> The 49 stock specialist firms on the Big Board floor -- the buyers and sellers of last resort who were criticized after the 1987 crash -- once again could n't handle the selling pressure . </s>
<s> Big investment banks refused to step up to the plate to support the beleaguered floor traders by buying big blocks of stock , traders say . </s>
<s> Heavy selling of Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index futures in Chicago relentlessly beat stocks downward . </s>
<s> Seven Big Board stocks -- UAL , AMR , BankAmerica , Walt Disney , Capital Cities\/ABC , Philip Morris and Pacific Telesis Group -- stopped trading and never resumed . </s>
<s> The finger-pointing has already begun . </s>
<s> `` The equity market was illiquid . </s>
<s> Once again -LCB- the specialists -RCB- were not able to handle the imbalances on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange , '' said Christopher Pedersen , senior vice president at Twenty-First Securities Corp . </s>
<s> Countered James Maguire , chairman of specialists Henderson Brothers Inc. : `` It is easy to say the specialist is n't doing his job . </s>
<s> When the dollar is in a free-fall , even central banks ca n't stop it . </s>
<s> Speculators are calling for a degree of liquidity that is not there in the market . '' </s>
<s> Many money managers and some traders had already left their offices early Friday afternoon on a warm autumn day -- because the stock market was so quiet . </s>
<s> Then in a lightning plunge , the Dow Jones industrials in barely an hour surrendered about a third of their gains this year , chalking up a 190.58-point , or 6.9 % , loss on the day in gargantuan trading volume . </s>
<s> Final-hour trading accelerated to 108.1 million shares , a record for the Big Board . </s>
<s> At the end of the day , 251.2 million shares were traded . </s>
<s> The Dow Jones industrials closed at 2569.26 . </s>
<s> The Dow 's decline was second in point terms only to the 508-point Black Monday crash that occurred Oct. 19 , 1987 . </s>
<s> In percentage terms , however , the Dow 's dive was the 12th-worst ever and the sharpest since the market fell 156.83 , or 8 % , a week after Black Monday . </s>
<s> The Dow fell 22.6 % on Black Monday . </s>
<s> Shares of UAL , the parent of United Airlines , were extremely active all day Friday , reacting to news and rumors about the proposed $ 6.79 billion buy-out of the airline by an employee-management group . </s>
<s> Wall Street 's takeover-stock speculators , or `` risk arbitragers , '' had placed unusually large bets that a takeover would succeed and UAL stock would rise . </s>
<s> At 2:43 p.m. EDT , came the sickening news : The Big Board was halting trading in UAL , `` pending news . '' </s>
<s> On the exchange floor , `` as soon as UAL stopped trading , we braced for a panic , '' said one top floor trader . </s>
<s> Several traders could be seen shaking their heads when the news flashed . </s>
<s> For weeks , the market had been nervous about takeovers , after Campeau Corp. 's cash crunch spurred concern about the prospects for future highly leveraged takeovers . </s>
<s> And 10 minutes after the UAL trading halt came news that the UAL group could n't get financing for its bid . </s>
<s> At this point , the Dow was down about 35 points . </s>
<s> The market crumbled . </s>
<s> Arbitragers could n't dump their UAL stock -- but they rid themselves of nearly every `` rumor '' stock they had . </s>
<s> For example , their selling caused trading halts to be declared in USAir Group , which closed down 3 7\/8 to 41 1\/2 , Delta Air Lines , which fell 7 3\/4 to 69 1\/4 , and Philips Industries , which sank 3 to 21 1\/2 . </s>
<s> These stocks eventually reopened . </s>
<s> But as panic spread , speculators began to sell blue-chip stocks such as Philip Morris and International Business Machines to offset their losses . </s>
<s> When trading was halted in Philip Morris , the stock was trading at 41 , down 3 3\/8 , while IBM closed 5 5\/8 lower at 102 . </s>
<s> Selling snowballed because of waves of automatic `` stop-loss '' orders , which are triggered by computer when prices fall to certain levels . </s>
<s> Most of the stock selling pressure came from Wall Street professionals , including computer-guided program traders . </s>
<s> Traders said most of their major institutional investors , on the other hand , sat tight . </s>
<s> Now , at 3:07 , one of the market 's post-crash `` reforms '' took hold as the S&P 500 futures contract had plunged 12 points , equivalent to around a 100-point drop in the Dow industrials . </s>
<s> Under an agreement signed by the Big Board and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , trading was temporarily halted in Chicago . </s>
<s> After the trading halt in the S&P 500 pit in Chicago , waves of selling continued to hit stocks themselves on the Big Board , and specialists continued to notch prices down . </s>
<s> As a result , the link between the futures and stock markets ripped apart . </s>
<s> Without the guidepost of stock-index futures -- the barometer of where traders think the overall stock market is headed -- many traders were afraid to trust stock prices quoted on the Big Board . </s>
<s> The futures halt was even assailed by Big Board floor traders . </s>
<s> `` It screwed things up , '' said one major specialist . </s>
<s> This confusion effectively halted one form of program trading , stock index arbitrage , that closely links the futures and stock markets , and has been blamed by some for the market 's big swings . </s>
<s> -LRB- In a stock-index arbitrage sell program , traders buy or sell big baskets of stocks and offset the trade in futures to lock in a price difference . -RRB- </s>
<s> `` When the airline information came through , it cracked every model we had for the marketplace , '' said a managing director at one of the largest program-trading firms . </s>
<s> `` We did n't even get a chance to do the programs we wanted to do . '' </s>
<s> But stocks kept falling . </s>
<s> The Dow industrials were down 55 points at 3 p.m. before the futures-trading halt . </s>
<s> At 3:30 p.m. , at the end of the `` cooling off '' period , the average was down 114.76 points . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , during the the S&P trading halt , S&P futures sell orders began piling up , while stocks in New York kept falling sharply . </s>
<s> Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan said yesterday the circuit breaker `` worked well mechanically . </s>
<s> I just think it 's nonproductive at this point to get into a debate if index arbitrage would have helped or hurt things . '' </s>
<s> Under another post-crash system , Big Board President Richard Grasso -LRB- Mr. Phelan was flying to Bangkok as the market was falling -RRB- was talking on an `` inter-exchange hot line '' to the other exchanges , the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve Board . </s>
<s> He camped out at a high-tech nerve center on the floor of the Big Board , where he could watch updates on prices and pending stock orders . </s>
<s> At about 3:30 p.m. EDT , S&P futures resumed trading , and for a brief time the futures and stock markets started to come back in line . </s>
<s> Buyers stepped in to the futures pit . </s>
<s> But the build-up of S&P futures sell orders weighed on the market , and the link with stocks began to fray again . </s>
<s> At about 3:45 , the S&P market careened to still another limit , of 30 points down , and trading was locked again . </s>
<s> Futures traders say the S&P was signaling that the Dow could fall as much as 200 points . </s>
<s> During this time , small investors began ringing their brokers , wondering whether another crash had begun . </s>
<s> At Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. , which is trying to cater to small investors , some demoralized brokers thought this would be the final confidence-crusher . </s>
<s> That 's when George L. Ball , chairman of the Prudential Insurance Co. of America unit , took to the internal intercom system to declare that the plunge was only `` mechanical . '' </s>
<s> `` I have a hunch that this particular decline today is something ` more ado about less . ' </s>
<s> It would be my inclination to advise clients not to sell , to look for an opportunity to buy , '' Mr. Ball told the brokers . </s>
<s> At Merrill Lynch & Co. , the nation 's biggest brokerage firm , a news release was prepared headlined `` Merrill Lynch Comments on Market Drop . '' </s>
<s> The release cautioned that `` there are significant differences between the current environment and that of October 1987 '' and that there are still `` attractive investment opportunities '' in the stock market . </s>
<s> However , Jeffrey B. Lane , president of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. , said that Friday 's plunge is `` going to set back '' relations with customers , `` because it reinforces the concern of volatility . </s>
<s> And I think a lot of people will harp on program trading . </s>
<s> It 's going to bring the debate right back to the forefront . '' </s>
<s> As the Dow average ground to its final 190.58 loss Friday , the S&P pit stayed locked at its 30-point trading limit . </s>
<s> Jeffrey Yass of program trader Susquehanna Investment Group said 2,000 S&P contracts were for sale on the close , the equivalent of $ 330 million in stock . </s>
<s> But there were no buyers . </s>
<s> While Friday 's debacle involved mainly professional traders rather than investors , it left the market vulnerable to continued selling this morning , traders said . </s>
<s> Stock-index futures contracts settled at much lower prices than indexes of the stock market itself . </s>
<s> At those levels , stocks are set up to be hammered by index arbitragers , who lock in profits by buying futures when futures prices fall , and simultaneously sell off stocks . </s>
<s> But nobody knows at what level the futures and stocks will open today . </s>
<s> The de-linkage between the stock and futures markets Friday will undoubtedly cause renewed debate about whether Wall Street is properly prepared for another crash situation . </s>
<s> The Big Board 's Mr. Grasso said , `` Our systemic performance was good . '' </s>
<s> But the exchange will `` look at the performance of all specialists in all stocks . </s>
<s> Obviously we 'll take a close look at any situation in which we think the dealer-community obligations were n't met , '' he said . </s>
<s> -LRB- See related story : `` Fed Ready to Inject Big Funds '' -- WSJ Oct. 16 , 1989 -RRB- </s>
<s> But specialists complain privately that just as in the 1987 crash , the `` upstairs '' firms -- big investment banks that support the market by trading big blocks of stock -- stayed on the sidelines during Friday 's blood-letting . </s>
<s> Mr. Phelan said , `` It will take another day or two '' to analyze who was buying and selling Friday . </s>
