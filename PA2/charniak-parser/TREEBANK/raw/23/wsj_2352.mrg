<s> The Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals opinion in the Arcadian Phosphate case did not repudiate the position Pennzoil Co. took in its dispute with Texaco , contrary to your Sept. 8 article `` Court Backs Texaco 's View in Pennzoil Case -- Too Late . '' </s>
<s> The fundamental rule of contract law applied to both cases was that courts will not enforce agreements to which the parties did not intend to be bound . </s>
<s> In the Pennzoil\/Texaco litigation , the courts found Pennzoil and Getty Oil intended to be bound ; in Arcadian Phosphates they found there was no intention to be bound . </s>
<s> Admittedly , the principle in the cases is the same . </s>
<s> But the outcome of a legal dispute almost always turns on the facts . </s>
<s> And the facts , as found by the various courts in these two lawsuits , were different . </s>
<s> When you suggest otherwise , you leave the realm of reporting and enter the orbit of speculation . </s>
