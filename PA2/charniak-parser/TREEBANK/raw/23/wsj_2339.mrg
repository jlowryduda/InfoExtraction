<s> Institut Merieux S.A. of France said the Canadian government raised an obstacle to its proposed acquisition of Connaught BioSciences Inc. for 942 million Canadian dollars -LRB- US$ 801.6 million -RRB- . </s>
<s> Merieux said the government 's minister of industry , science and technology told it that he was n't convinced that the purchase is likely to be of `` net benefit '' to Canada . </s>
<s> Canadian investment rules require that big foreign takeovers meet that standard . </s>
<s> The French company said the government gave it 30 days in which to submit information to further support its takeover plan . </s>
<s> Both Merieux and Connaught are biotechnology research and vaccine manufacturing concerns . </s>
<s> The government 's action was unusual . </s>
<s> Alan Nymark , executive vice president of Investment Canada , which oversees foreign takeovers , said it marked the first time in its four-year history that the agency has made an adverse net-benefit decision about the acquisition of a publicly traded company . </s>
<s> He said it has reached the same conclusions about some attempts to buy closely held concerns , but eventually allowed those acquisitions to proceed . </s>
<s> `` This is n't a change in government policy ; this provision has been used before , '' said Jodi Redmond , press secretary for Harvie Andre , Canada 's minister of industry , science and technology . </s>
<s> Mr. Andre issued the ruling based on a recommendation by Investment Canada . </s>
<s> Spokesmen for Merieux and Connaught said they had n't been informed of specific areas of concern by either the government or Investment Canada , but added they hope to have more information early this week . </s>
<s> Investment Canada declined to comment on the reasons for the government decision . </s>
<s> Viren Mehta , a partner with Mehta & Isaly , a New York-based pharmaceutical industry research firm , said the government 's ruling was n't unexpected . </s>
<s> `` This has become a very politicized deal , concerning Canada 's only large , world-class bio-research or pharmaceutical company , '' Mr. Mehta said . </s>
<s> Mr. Mehta said the move that could allow the transaction to go ahead as planned could be an out-of-court settlement of Connaught 's dispute with the University of Toronto . </s>
<s> The University is seeking to block the acquisition of Connaught by foreign interests , citing concerns about the amount of research that would be done in Canada . </s>
<s> The university is considering a settlement proposal made by Connaught . </s>
<s> While neither side will disclose its contents , Mr. Mehta expects it to contain more specific guarantees on research and development spending levels in Canada than Merieux offered to Investment Canada . </s>
<s> Some analysts , such as Murray Grossner of Toronto-based Richardson Greenshields Inc. , believe the government ruling leaves the door open for other bidders , such as Switzerland 's Ciba-Geigy and Chiron Corp. of Emeryville , Calif . </s>
<s> Officials for the two concerns , which are bidding C$ 30 a share for Connaught , could n't be reached for comment . </s>
<s> French state-owned Rhone-Poulenc S.A. holds 51 % of Merieux . </s>
