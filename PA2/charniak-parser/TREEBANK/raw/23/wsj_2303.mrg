<s> Mr. Shidler 's company specializes in commercial real-estate investment and claims to have $ 1 billion in assets ; Mr. Simpson is a developer and a former senior executive of L.J. Hooker . </s>
<s> `` The assets are good , but they require more money and management '' than can be provided in L.J. Hooker 's current situation , said Mr. Simpson in an interview . `` </s>
<s> Hooker 's philosophy was to build and sell . </s>
<s> We want to build and hold . '' </s>
<s> L.J. Hooker , based in Atlanta , is operating with protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code . </s>
<s> Its parent company , Hooker Corp. of Sydney , Australia , is currently being managed by a court-appointed provisional liquidator . </s>
<s> Sanford Sigoloff , chief executive of L.J. Hooker , said yesterday in a statement that he has not yet seen the bid but that he would review it and bring it to the attention of the creditors committee . </s>
<s> The $ 409 million bid is estimated by Mr. Simpson as representing 75 % of the value of all Hooker real-estate holdings in the U.S. . </s>
<s> Not included in the bid are Bonwit Teller or B. Altman & Co. , L.J. Hooker 's department-store chains . </s>
<s> The offer covers the massive 1.8 million-square-foot Forest Fair Mall in Cincinnati , the 800,000 square-foot Richland Fashion Mall in Columbia , S.C. , and the 700,000 square-foot Thornton Town Center mall in Thornton , Colo . </s>

<s> L.J. Hooker was a small home-building company based in Atlanta in 1979 when Mr. Simpson was hired to push it into commercial development . </s>
<s> The company grew modestly until 1986 , when a majority position in Hooker Corp. was acquired by Australian developer George Herscu , currently Hooker 's chairman . </s>
<s> Mr. Herscu proceeded to launch an ambitious , but ill-fated , $ 1 billion acquisition binge that included Bonwit Teller and B. Altman & Co. , as well as majority positions in Merksamer Jewelers , a Sacramento chain ; Sakowitz Inc. , the Houston-based retailer , and Parisian Inc. , the Southeast department-store chain . </s>
<s> Eventually Mr. Simpson and Mr. Herscu had a falling out over the direction of the company , and Mr. Simpson said he resigned in 1988 . </s>
<s> Since then , Hooker Corp. has sold its interest in the Parisian chain back to Parisian 's management and is currently attempting to sell the B. Altman & Co. chain . </s>
<s> In addition , Robert Sakowitz , chief executive of the Sakowitz chain , is seeking funds to buy out the Hooker interest in his company . </s>
<s> The Merksamer chain is currently being offered for sale by First Boston Corp . </s>
<s> Reached in Honolulu , Mr. Shidler said that he believes the various Hooker malls can become profitable with new management . </s>
<s> `` These are n't mature assets , but they have the potential to be so , '' said Mr. Shidler . </s>
<s> `` Managed properly , and with a long-term outlook , these can become investment-grade quality properties . </s>
