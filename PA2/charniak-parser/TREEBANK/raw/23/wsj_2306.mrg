<s> As small investors peppered their mutual funds with phone calls over the weekend , big fund managers said they have a strong defense against any wave of withdrawals : cash . </s>
<s> Unlike the weekend before Black Monday , the funds were n't swamped with heavy withdrawal requests . </s>
<s> And many fund managers have built up cash levels and say they will be buying stock this week . </s>
<s> At Fidelity Investments , the nation 's largest fund company , telephone volume was up sharply , but it was still at just half the level of the weekend preceding Black Monday in 1987 . </s>
<s> The Boston firm said stock-fund redemptions were running at less than one-third the level two years ago . </s>
<s> As of yesterday afternoon , the redemptions represented less than 15 % of the total cash position of about $ 2 billion of Fidelity 's stock funds . </s>
<s> `` Two years ago there were massive redemption levels over the weekend and a lot of fear around , '' said C. Bruce Johnstone , who runs Fidelity Investments ' $ 5 billion Equity-Income Fund . </s>
<s> `` This feels more like a one-shot deal . </s>
<s> People are n't panicking . '' </s>
<s> The test may come today . </s>
<s> Friday 's stock market sell-off came too late for many investors to act . </s>
<s> Some shareholders have held off until today because any fund exchanges made after Friday 's close would take place at today 's closing prices . </s>
<s> Stock fund redemptions during the 1987 debacle did n't begin to snowball until after the market opened on Black Monday . </s>
<s> But fund managers say they 're ready . </s>
<s> Many have raised cash levels , which act as a buffer against steep market declines . </s>
<s> Mario Gabelli , for instance , holds cash positions well above 20 % in several of his funds . </s>
<s> Windsor Fund 's John Neff and Mutual Series ' Michael Price said they had raised their cash levels to more than 20 % and 30 % , respectively , this year . </s>
<s> Even Peter Lynch , manager of Fidelity 's $ 12.7 billion Magellan Fund , the nation 's largest stock fund , built up cash to 7 % or $ 850 million . </s>
<s> One reason is that after two years of monthly net redemptions , the fund posted net inflows of money from investors in August and September . </s>
<s> `` I 've let the money build up , '' Mr. Lynch said , who added that he has had trouble finding stocks he likes . </s>
<s> Not all funds have raised cash levels , of course . </s>
<s> As a group , stock funds held 10.2 % of assets in cash as of August , the latest figures available from the Investment Company Institute . </s>
<s> That was modestly higher than the 8.8 % and 9.2 % levels in August and September of 1987 . </s>
<s> Also , persistent redemptions would force some fund managers to dump stocks to raise cash . </s>
<s> But a strong level of investor withdrawals is much more unlikely this time around , fund managers said . </s>
<s> A major reason is that investors already have sharply scaled back their purchases of stock funds since Black Monday . </s>
<s> Stock-fund sales have rebounded in recent months , but monthly net purchases are still running at less than half 1987 levels . </s>
<s> `` There 's not nearly as much froth , '' said John Bogle , chairman of Vanguard Group Inc. , a big Valley Forge , Pa. , fund company . </s>
<s> Many fund managers argue that now 's the time to buy . </s>
<s> Vincent Bajakian , manager of the $ 1.8 billion Wellington Fund , added to his positions in Bristol-Myers Squibb , Woolworth and Dun & Bradstreet Friday . </s>
<s> And today he 'll be looking to buy drug stocks like Eli Lilly , Pfizer and American Home Products whose dividend yields have been bolstered by stock declines . </s>
<s> Fidelity 's Mr. Lynch , for his part , snapped up Southern Co. shares Friday after the stock got hammered . </s>
<s> If the market drops further today , he said he 'll be buying blue chips such as Bristol-Myers and Kellogg . </s>
<s> `` If they croak stocks like that , '' he said , it presents an opportunity that is `` the kind of thing you dream about . '' </s>
<s> Major mutual-fund groups said phone calls were arriving at twice the normal weekend pace yesterday . </s>
<s> But most investors were seeking share prices and other information . </s>
<s> Trading volume was only modestly higher than normal . </s>
<s> Still , fund groups are n't taking any chances . </s>
<s> They hope to avoid the jammed phone lines and other snags that infuriated some fund investors in October 1987 . </s>
<s> Fidelity on Saturday opened its 54 walk-in investor centers across the country . </s>
<s> The centers normally are closed through the weekend . </s>
<s> In addition , East Coast centers will open at 7:30 EDT this morning , instead of the normal 8:30 . </s>
<s> T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. increased its staff of phone representatives to handle investor requests . </s>
<s> The Baltimore-based group noted that some investors moved money from stock funds to money-market funds . </s>
<s> But most investors seemed to be `` in an information mode rather than in a transaction mode , '' said Steven Norwitz , a vice president . </s>
<s> And Vanguard , among other groups , said it was adding more phone representatives today to help investors get through . </s>
<s> In an unusual move , several funds moved to calm investors with recordings on their toll-free phone lines . </s>
<s> `` We view -LCB- Friday 's -RCB- market decline as offering us a buying opportunity as long-term investors , '' a recording at Gabelli & Co. funds said over the weekend . </s>
<s> The Janus Group had a similar recording for investors . </s>
<s> Several fund managers expect a rough market this morning before prices stabilize . </s>
<s> Some early selling is likely to stem from investors and portfolio managers who want to lock in this year 's fat profits . </s>
<s> Stock funds have averaged a staggering gain of 25 % through September , according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc . </s>
<s> Elaine Garzarelli , who runs Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 's $ 335 million Sector Analysis Portfolio , predicts the market will open down at least 50 points on technical factors and `` some panic selling . '' </s>
<s> But she expects prices to rebound soon and is telling investors she expects the stock market wo n't decline more than 10 % to 15 % from recent highs . </s>
<s> `` This is not a major crash , '' she said . </s>
<s> Nevertheless , Ms. Garzarelli said she was swamped with phone calls over the weekend from nervous shareholders . </s>
<s> `` Half of them are really scared and want to sell , '' she said , `` but I 'm trying to talk them out of it . '' </s>
<s> She added , `` If they all were bullish , I 'd really be upset . '' </s>
<s> The backdrop to Friday 's slide was markedly different from that of the October 1987 crash , fund managers argue . </s>
<s> Two years ago , unlike today , the dollar was weak , interest rates were rising and the market was very overvalued , they say . </s>
<s> `` From the investors ' standpoint , institutions and individuals learned a painful lesson ... by selling at the lows '' on Black Monday , said Stephen Boesel , manager of the $ 580 million T. Rowe Price Growth and Income Fund . </s>
<s> This time , `` I do n't think we 'll get a panic reaction . </s>
