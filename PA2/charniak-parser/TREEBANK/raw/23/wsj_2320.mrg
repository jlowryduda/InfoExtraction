<s> Measuring cups may soon be replaced by tablespoons in the laundry room . </s>
<s> Procter & Gamble Co. plans to begin testing next month a superconcentrated detergent that will require only a few spoonfuls per washload . </s>
<s> The move stems from lessons learned in Japan where local competitors have had phenomenal success with concentrated soapsuds . </s>
<s> It also marks P&G 's growing concern that its Japanese rivals , such as Kao Corp. , may bring their superconcentrates to the U.S. . </s>
<s> The Cincinnati consumer-products giant got clobbered two years ago in Japan when Kao introduced a powerful detergent , called Attack , which quickly won a 30 % stake in the Japanese markets . </s>
<s> `` They do n't want to get caught again , '' says one industry watcher . </s>
<s> Retailers in Phoenix , Ariz. , say P&G 's new powdered detergent -- to be called Cheer with Color Guard -- will be on shelves in that market by early November . </s>
<s> A P&G spokeswoman confirmed that shipments to Phoenix started late last month . </s>
<s> She said the company will study results from this market before expanding to others . </s>
<s> Superconcentrates are n't entirely new for P&G . </s>
<s> The company introduced a superconcentrated Lemon Cheer in Japan after watching the success of Attack . </s>
<s> When Attack hit the shelves in 1987 , P&G 's share of the Japanese market fell to about 8 % from more than 20 % . </s>
<s> With the help of Lemon Cheer , P&G 's share is now estimated to be 12 % . </s>
<s> While the Japanese have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products , the true test for P&G will be in the $ 4 billion U.S. detergent market , where growth is slow and liquids have gained prominence over powders . </s>
<s> The company may have chosen to market the product under the Cheer name since it 's already expanded its best-selling Tide into 16 different varieties , including this year 's big hit , Tide with Bleach . </s>
<s> With superconcentrates , however , it is n't always easy to persuade consumers that less is more ; many people tend to dump too much detergent into the washing machine , believing that it takes a cup of powder to really clean the laundry . </s>
<s> In the early 1980s , P&G tried to launch here a concentrated detergent under the Ariel brand name that it markets in Europe . </s>
<s> But the product , which was n't as concentrated as the new Cheer , bombed in a market test in Denver and was dropped . </s>
<s> P&G and others also have tried repeatedly to hook consumers on detergent and fabric softener combinations in pouches , but they have n't sold well , despite the convenience . </s>
<s> But P&G contends the new Cheer is a unique formula that also offers an ingredient that prevents colors from fading . </s>
<s> And retailers are expected to embrace the product , in part because it will take up less shelf space . </s>
<s> `` When shelf space was cheap , bigger was better , '' says Hugh Zurkuhlen , an analyst at Salomon Bros . </s>
<s> But with so many brands vying for space , that 's no longer the case . </s>
<s> If the new Cheer sells well , the trend toward smaller packaging is likely to accelerate as competitors follow with their own superconcentrates . </s>
<s> Then retailers `` will probably push the -LCB- less-established -RCB- brands out altogether , '' he says . </s>
<s> Competition is bound to get tougher if Kao introduces a product like Attack in the U.S. . </s>
<s> To be sure , Kao would n't have an easy time taking U.S. market share away from the mighty P&G , which has about 23 % of the market . </s>
<s> Kao officials previously have said they are interested in selling detergents in the U.S. , but so far the company has focused on acquisitions , such as last year 's purchase of Andrew Jergens Co. , a Cincinnati hand-lotion maker . </s>
<s> It also has a product-testing facility in California . </s>
<s> Some believe P&G 's interest in a superconcentrated detergent goes beyond the concern for the Japanese . </s>
<s> `` This is something P&G would do with or without Kao , '' says Mr. Zurkuhlen . </s>
