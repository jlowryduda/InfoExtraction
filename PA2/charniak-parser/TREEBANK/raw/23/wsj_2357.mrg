<s> The franchisees , owners or operators of 1,000 of the 1,900 franchised Arby 's in the U.S. , said : `` We have concluded that continued control of Arby 's by Victor Posner is totally unacceptable to us , because it is extremely likely to cause irreparable damage to the Arby 's system . </s>
<s> We support all efforts to remove Victor Posner from control of Arby 's Inc. and the Arby 's system . '' </s>
