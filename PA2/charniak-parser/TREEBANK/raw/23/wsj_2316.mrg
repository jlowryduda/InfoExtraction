<s> The U.S. , which is finalizing its steel-import quotas , is allocating a larger share of its steel market to developing and newly industrialized countries which have relatively unsubsidized steel industries . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , the U.S. has negotiated a significant cut in Japan 's steel quota , and made only a minor increase to the steel allotment for the European Community . </s>
<s> Brazil , similar to Mexico and South Korea , is expected to negotiate a somewhat bigger share of the U.S. market than it had under the previous five-year steel quotas , which expired Sept. 30 . </s>
<s> Brazil and Venezuela are the only two countries that have n't completed steel talks with the U.S. for the year ending Oct. 1 , 1990 . </s>
<s> In recent years , U.S. steelmakers have supplied about 80 % of the 100 million tons of steel used annually by the nation . </s>
<s> Of the remaining 20 % needed , the steel-quota negotiations allocate about 15 % to foreign suppliers , with the difference supplied mainly by Canada -- which is n't included in the quota program . </s>
<s> Other countries that do n't have formal steel quotas with the U.S. , such as Taiwan , Sweden and Argentina , also have supplied steel . </s>
<s> Some of these countries have in recent years made informal agreements with the U.S. that are similar to quotas . </s>
<s> The Bush administration earlier this year said it would extend steel quotas , known as voluntary restraint agreements , until March 31 , 1992 . </s>
<s> It also said it would use that two-and-a-half year period to work toward an international consensus on freeing up the international steel trade , which has been notoriously managed , subsidized and protected by governments . </s>
<s> The U.S. termed its plan , a `` trade liberalization program , '' despite the fact that it is merely an extension . </s>
<s> Mexico , which was one of the first countries to conclude its steel talks with the U.S. , virtually doubled its quota to 0.95 % of the U.S. steel market from 0.48 % under the previous quotas . </s>
<s> South Korea , which had 1.9 % under the previous quotas , is set to get a small increase to about 1.95 % . </s>
<s> That increase rises to slightly more than 2 % of the U.S. market if a joint Korean-U.S. steel project is included . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , Brazil is expected to increase its allowance from the 1.43 % share it has had in recent years . </s>
<s> The EC and Japan -- the U.S. 's largest steel suppliers -- have n't been filling their quotas to the full extent . </s>
<s> The EC steel industry , which has been coping with strong European demand , has been supplying about 5 % of the U.S. market compared with recent quotas of about 6.7 % . </s>
<s> Japan has been shipping steel to total about 4.5 % of the U.S. market compared with a quota of 5.9 % . </s>
<s> In the recent talks , the EC had its quota increased about 300,000 tons , to 7 % of the U.S. market from 6.7 % in 1988 . </s>
<s> But its quota has been as high as 6.9 % in 1984 . </s>
<s> Japan , however , has agreed to cut its quota to about 5 % from 5.9 % previously . </s>
<s> Japan , the EC , Brazil , Mexico and South Korea provide about 80 % of the steel imported to the U.S. under the quota program . </s>
<s> The balance is supplied by a host of smaller exporters , such as Australia and Venezuela . </s>
<s> The U.S. had about an extra 2 % of the domestic steel market to give to foreign suppliers in its quota talks . </s>
<s> That was essentially made up of a 1 % increase in the overall quota program and 1 % from cutting Japan 's allowance . </s>
<s> Negotiators from the White House trade office will repeat these quota negotiations next year when they will have another 1 % of the U.S. steel market to allocate . </s>
<s> These optional 1%-a-year increases to the steel quota program are built into the Bush administration 's steel-quota program to give its negotiators leverage with foreign steel suppliers to try to get them to withdraw subsidies and protectionism from their own steel industries . </s>
