<s> September 's steep rise in producer prices shows that inflation still persists , and the pessimism over interest rates caused by the new price data contributed to the stock market 's plunge Friday . </s>
<s> After falling for three consecutive months , the producer price index for finished goods shot up 0.9 % last month , the Labor Department reported Friday , as energy prices jumped after tumbling through the summer . </s>
<s> Although the report , which was released before the stock market opened , did n't trigger the 190.58-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , analysts said it did play a role in the market 's decline . </s>
<s> Analysts immediately viewed the price data , the grimmest inflation news in months , as evidence that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to allow interest rates to fall as many investors had hoped . </s>
<s> Further fueling the belief that pressures in the economy were sufficient to keep the Fed from easing credit , the Commerce Department reported Friday that retail sales grew 0.5 % in September , to $ 145.21 billion . </s>
<s> That rise came on top of a 0.7 % gain in August , and suggested there is still healthy consumer demand in the economy . </s>
<s> `` I think the Friday report , combined with the actions of the Fed , weakened the belief that there was going to be an imminent easing of monetary policy , '' said Robert Dederick , chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago . </s>
<s> But economists were divided over the extent of the inflation threat signaled by the new numbers . </s>
<s> `` The overall 0.9 % increase is serious in itself , but what is even worse is that excluding food and energy , the producer price index still increased by 0.7 % , '' said Gordon Richards , an economist at the National Association of Manufacturers . </s>
<s> But Sung Won Sohn , chief economist at Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis , blamed rising energy prices and the annual autumn increase in car prices for most of the September jump . </s>
<s> `` I would say this is not bad news ; this is a blip , '' he said . </s>
<s> `` The core rate is not really out of line . '' </s>
<s> All year , energy prices have skewed the producer price index , which measures changes in the prices producers receive for goods . </s>
<s> Inflation unquestionably has fallen back from its torrid pace last winter , when a steep run-up in world oil prices sent the index surging at double-digit annual rates . </s>
<s> Energy prices then plummeted through the summer , causing the index to decline for three consecutive months . </s>
<s> Overall , the index has climbed at a 5.1 % compound annual rate since the start of the year , the Labor Department said . </s>
<s> While far more restrained than the pace at the beginning of the year , that is still a steeper rise than the 4.0 % increase for all of 1988 . </s>
<s> Moreover , this year 's good inflation news may have ended last month , when energy prices zoomed up 6.5 % after plunging 7.3 % in August . </s>
<s> Some analysts expect oil prices to remain relatively stable in the months ahead , leaving the future pace of inflation uncertain . </s>
<s> Analysts had expected that the climb in oil prices last month would lead to a substantial rise in the producer price index , but the 0.9 % climb was higher than most anticipated . </s>
<s> `` I think the resurgence -LCB- in inflation -RCB- is going to continue for a few months , '' said John Mueller , chief economist at Bell Mueller Cannon , a Washington economic forecasting firm . </s>
<s> He predicted that inflation will moderate next year , saying that credit conditions are fairly tight world-wide . </s>
<s> But Dirk Van Dongen , president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors , said that last month 's rise `` is n't as bad an omen '' as the 0.9 % figure suggests . </s>
<s> `` If you examine the data carefully , the increase is concentrated in energy and motor vehicle prices , rather than being a broad-based advance in the prices of consumer and industrial goods , '' he explained . </s>
<s> Passenger car prices jumped 3.8 % in September , after climbing 0.5 % in August and declining in the late spring and summer . </s>
<s> Many analysts said the September increase was a one-time event , coming as dealers introduced their 1990 models . </s>
<s> Although all the price data were adjusted for normal seasonal fluctuations , car prices rose beyond the customary autumn increase . </s>
<s> Prices for capital equipment rose a hefty 1.1 % in September , while prices for home electronic equipment fell 1.1 % . </s>
<s> Food prices declined 0.6 % , after climbing 0.3 % in August . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , the retail sales report showed that car sales rose 0.8 % in September to $ 32.82 billion . </s>
<s> But at least part of the increase could have come from higher prices , analysts said . </s>
<s> Sales at general merchandise stores rose 1.7 % after declining 0.6 % in August , while sales of building materials fell 1.8 % after rising 1.7 % . </s>
<s> Producer prices for intermediate goods grew 0.4 % in September , after dropping for three consecutive months . </s>
<s> Prices for crude goods , an array of raw materials , jumped 1.1 % after declining 1.9 % in August and edging up 0.2 % in July . </s>
<s> Here are the Labor Department 's producer price indexes -LRB- 1982 = 100 -RRB- for September , before seasonal adjustment , and the percentage changes from September , 1988 . </s>
