<s> Elcotel Inc. expects fiscal second-quarter earnings to trail 1988 results , but anticipates that several new products will lead to a `` much stronger '' performance in its second half . </s>
<s> Elcotel , a telecommunications company , had net income of $ 272,000 , or five cents a share , in its year-earlier second quarter , ended Sept. 30 . </s>
<s> Revenue totaled $ 5 million . </s>
<s> George Pierce , chairman and chief executive officer , said in an interview that earnings in the most recent quarter will be about two cents a share on revenue of just under $ 4 million . </s>
<s> The lower results , Mr. Pierce said , reflect a 12-month decline in industry sales of privately owned pay telephones , Elcotel 's primary business . </s>
<s> Although Mr. Pierce expects that line of business to strengthen in the next year , he said Elcotel will also benefit from moving into other areas . </s>
<s> Foremost among those is the company 's entrance into the public facsimile business , Mr. Pierce said . </s>
<s> Within the next year , Elcotel expects to place 10,000 fax machines , made by Minolta in Japan , in hotels , municipal buildings , drugstores and other public settings around the country . </s>
<s> Elcotel will provide a credit-card reader for the machines to collect , store and forward billing data . </s>
<s> Mr. Pierce said Elcotel should realize a minimum of $ 10 of recurring net earnings for each machine each month . </s>
<s> Elcotel has also developed an automatic call processor that will make further use of the company 's system for automating and handling credit-card calls and collect calls . </s>
<s> Automatic call processors will provide that system for virtually any telephone , Mr. Pierce said , not just phones produced by Elcotel . </s>
<s> The company will also be producing a new line of convenience telephones , which do n't accept coins , for use in hotel lobbies , office lobbies , hospitality lounges and similar settings . </s>
<s> Mr. Pierce estimated that the processors and convenience phones would produce about $ 5 of recurring net earnings for each machine each month . </s>
