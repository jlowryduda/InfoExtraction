<s> Maidenform Inc. loves to be intimate with its customers , but not with the rest of the public . </s>
<s> The 67-year-old maker of brassieres , panties , and lingerie enjoys one of the best-known brand images , but its financial profile is closely guarded by members of the founding family . </s>
<s> `` There are very few companies that can boast of such a close-knit group , '' says Robert A. Brawer , 52 years old , recently named president , succeeding Beatrice Coleman , his mother-in-law , who remains chairman . </s>

<s> The Maidenform name `` is part of American pop culture , '' says Joan Sinopoli , account supervisor of the campaign by Levine , Huntley , Schmidt & Beaver , a New York ad firm . </s>
<s> Maidenform generated such memorable campaigns as `` I dreamed I ... in my Maidenform bra , '' and `` The Maidenform woman . </s>

<s> `` Capitalizing on the brand is key , '' says Mr. Brawer , whose immediate plans include further international expansion and getting better control of distribution outside the U.S. . </s>
<s> `` The intimate apparel industry is perceived to be a growth industry and clearly -LCB- Maidenform -RCB- is a force to be reckoned with , '' says David S. Leibowitz , a special situations analyst at American Securities Corp. in New York . </s>
<s> Although working women are `` forced to wear the uniform of the day , to retain their femininity they are buying better quality , more upscale intimate apparel , '' he said . </s>
<s> Although Mr. Brawer 's appointment as president was long expected , the move on Sept. 25 precipitated the resignation of Alan Lesk as senior vice president of sales and merchandising . </s>
<s> Three days later , Mr. Lesk was named president and chief executive officer of Olga Co. , a competing intimate apparel division of Warnaco Inc . </s>
<s> Warnaco also owns Warners , another major intimate apparel maker . </s>
<s> Mr. Lesk could n't be reached to comment . </s>
<s> But Maidenform officials say that after spending 24 years at Maidenform , Mr. Lesk , 48 , made it clear he wanted the top job . </s>
<s> `` If you want the presidency of the company , this is n't the firm to work for , '' says James Mogan , 45 , who was named senior vice president of sales , assuming some of the responsibilities of Mr. Lesk . </s>

<s> Warnaco was taken private by Spectrum Group in 1986 for about $ 487 million . </s>
<s> And last year , Playtex Holdings Inc. went private for about $ 680 million . </s>

<s> Publicly traded VF Corp. , which owns Vanity Fair , and Sara Lee Corp. , which owns Bali Co. , are also strong forces in intimate apparel . </s>
<s> Buy-out offers for Maidenform are n't infrequent , says Executive Vice President David C. Masket , but they are n't taken very seriously . </s>

<s> Executives say Mrs. Coleman is very involved in the day-to-day operations , especially product development . </s>
<s> In the late 1960s she designed a lightweight stretch bra that boosted sales . </s>
<s> Her father , William Rosenthal , designed the then-dress making company 's first bra in the 1920s , which he said gave women a `` maiden form '' compared with the `` boyish form '' they got from the `` flat bandages '' used for support at the time . </s>
<s> While Mr. Rosenthal introduced new undergarment designs , his wife , Ida , concentrated on sales and other financial matters . </s>
<s> The name Maidenform was coined by a third business partner , Enid Bissett . </s>
