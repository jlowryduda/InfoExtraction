<s> When last we left him , FBI Agent Nick Mancuso had solved a murder mystery , unraveled a Washington political scandal , and racked up some pretty good ratings numbers in the miniseries `` Favorite Son . '' </s>
<s> What next for the crusty FBI agent with the heart of gold ? </s>
<s> A spinoff series , of course . </s>
<s> There are plenty of worse inspirations for shows -- and most of them had already made the fall lineup : </s>
<s> a nun raising some lovable orphans . </s>
<s> A den mother raising some lovable teen models . </s>
<s> A bunch of tans and bathing suits posing as lovable lifeguards . </s>
<s> In that context , Robert Loggia 's riveting performance as the unlovable -- even crotchety -- veteran agent seems a better franchise for a series than most . </s>
<s> Week by week on `` Mancuso FBI '' -LRB- NBC , Fridays , 10 p.m . ET -RRB- , he pokes around the crime styles of the rich , famous and powerful of the Washington scene -- a loose cannon on deck at the FBI . </s>
<s> Over the first few weeks , `` Mancuso FBI '' has sprung straight from the headlines , which is either a commendable stab at topicality , or a lack of imagination , or both . </s>
<s> The opening show featured a secretary of defense designate accused of womanizing -LRB- a la John Tower -RRB- . </s>
<s> When his secretary is found floating dead in the pol 's pool , Mancuso is called in to investigate . </s>
<s> Last week , a young black girl claimed she had been raped by a white police officer -LRB- a la Tawana Brawley -RRB- . </s>
<s> In this week 's show , there 's an unsafe nuclear weaponsmaking facility -LRB- a la Rocky Flats -RRB- . </s>
<s> Along the way , we 're introduced to the supporting cast : a blond bombshell secretary -LRB- Randi Brazen -- her real name , honest -RRB- , a scheming young boss -LRB- Fredric Lehne -RRB- , another blonde bombshell who 's also an idealistic lawyer -LRB- Lindsay Frost -RRB- , and a forensics expert -LRB- Charles Siebert -RRB- . </s>
<s> If all of this seems a little stale , it 's redeemed in part by some tricky plot twists : </s>
<s> The usual suspects are found to be guilty , then not guilty , then guilty -- but of a different crime . </s>
<s> -LRB- In last week 's rape case , for example , the girl turns out to have been a victim of incest , and the biggest villains are the politicians who exploit the case . -RRB- </s>
<s> Most of all though , the show is redeemed by the character of Mancuso . </s>
<s> What makes the veteran FBI man so endearing is his hard-bitten cynicism -- earned , we discover , when he was assigned to the civil rights movement back in the 1960s . </s>
<s> He was n't protecting the Freedom Marchers ; he was tailing them as subversives . </s>
<s> This is not the `` Mississippi Burning '' scenario that thrills his young colleagues : `` Kid , you 've been reading Classic Comics too long , '' Mancuso says . </s>
<s> `` Back in 1964 , the FBI had five black agents . </s>
<s> Three were chauffeurs for J. Edgar Hoover , and two cleaned his house . '' </s>
<s> At the core of Mr. Loggia 's Mancuso is his world-weary truculence . </s>
<s> He describes a reporter as `` Miss First Amendment . '' </s>
<s> He describes a drowned corpse as `` Esther Williams . '' </s>
<s> And when he 's told `` Try a little tenderness , '' he shoots back `` I 'm going home to try a little linguine . '' </s>
<s> Yet for all his cynicism , he 's at heart a closet idealist , a softy with a secret crush on truth , justice and the American Way . </s>
<s> He 's the kind of guy who rescues trampled flags . </s>
<s> If `` Mancuso FBI '' has an intriguing central character , it also has a major flaw : </s>
<s> It 's wildly overwritten . </s>
<s> Executive Producers Steve Sohmer and Jeff Bleckner -LRB- and writer\/producers Ken Solarz and Steve Bello -RRB- have revved this show up to the breaking point . </s>
<s> To start , there 's always a crisis -- and someone always worries , `` What if the press gets a hold of this ? '' </s>
<s> At least once an episode we see protestors marching around screaming slogans . </s>
<s> At least once Mancuso 's boss yells `` In here -- now , '' and proceeds to dress his investigator down : </s>
<s> `` You are a dinosaur ... a hangover in a $ 10 suit ... </s>
<s> One more word and you are out on a park bench , mister . '' </s>
<s> Finally , of course , the boss gives in , but he 's still yelling : `` I find myself explaining anything to Teddy Kennedy , you 'll be chasing stolen cars in Anchorage . '' </s>
<s> In fact , throughout `` Mancuso FBI , '' we do n't get words or lines -- we get speeches . </s>
<s> Witnesses shout , scream , pontificate : `` ... a dream that the planet could be saved from itself and from the sadistic dumb creatures who try to tear down every decent man who raises his voice . '' </s>
<s> And Mancuso himself is investigating at the top of his lungs : `` How the hell can you live with yourself ? '' he erupts at a politician . </s>
<s> `` You twist people 's trust . </s>
<s> You built your career on prejudice and hate . </s>
<s> The scars will be here years after the polls close . '' </s>
<s> In each show , Mancuso gets to unleash similar harangues : </s>
<s> `` Where the hell are they gon na live when people like you turn the world into a big toxic waste dump ? </s>
<s> You 're the real criminal here ... and what you did was n't just a murder -- it was a crime against humanity . '' </s>
<s> And , at least once a show , someone delivers the line `` Get off that soapbox . '' </s>
<s> Now that 's advice the writers should take to heart . </s>
<s> They have a series with a good character , some interesting , even occasionally surprising plot lines , and they 're ruining it . </s>
<s> Why , when a key witness disappears , does Mancuso trash her apartment , tearing down drapes , smashing walls ? </s>
<s> It 's a bizarre and totally inappropriate reaction , all to add more pizzazz to a script that 's already overdosing on pizzazz . </s>
<s> That 's not plot . </s>
<s> That 's not character . </s>
<s> That 's hyperventilating . </s>
<s> There is a scene at the end of the first week 's show where Mancuso attends the unveiling of the memorial to his dead partner David . </s>
<s> Asked to say a few words , he pulls out his crumpled piece of paper and tries to talk , but he 's too choked up to get the words out . </s>
<s> He bangs on the piece of paper in frustration , then turns and walks away . </s>
<s> It was a profoundly moving moment for series television , and Robert Loggia 's acting resonated in the silence . </s>
<s> There 's a pretty good program inside all the noise of `` Mancuso FBI . '' </s>
<s> If the show 's creators could just let themselves be quiet for a little , they might just hear it . </s>
