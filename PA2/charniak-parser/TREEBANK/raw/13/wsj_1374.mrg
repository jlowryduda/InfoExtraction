<s> Tandy Corp. , citing sluggish sales of consumer-electronics goods , said net income dropped 3.3 % for the first quarter ended Sept. 30 . </s>
<s> The results , which represented the fifth consecutive quarter of flat-to-lower earnings for the big electronics retailer , disappointed analysts and traders . </s>
<s> Tandy 's stock fell $ 1.375 a share to close at $ 44 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading . </s>
<s> Net for the quarter was $ 62.8 million , or 73 cents a share , down from $ 64.9 million , or 72 cents a share , a year earlier . </s>
<s> The company said earnings would have increased if it had n't been actively repurchasing its shares , thus increasing its interest expense and reducing its interest income . </s>
<s> Tandy had 86.3 million shares outstanding at Sept. 30 , down from 90 million a year earlier . </s>
<s> Revenue rose 5 % to $ 986 million from $ 937 million . </s>
<s> Tandy said consumer electronics sales at its Radio Shack stores have been slow , partly because of a lack of hot , new products . </s>
<s> `` Radio Shack continues to be lackluster , '' said Dennis Telzrow , analyst with Eppler , Guerin & Turner in Dallas . </s>
<s> He said Tandy `` has done a decent job '' increasing sales by manufacturing computers for others and expanding sales of its Grid Systems Corp. subsidiary , which sells computers to bigger businesses , but `` it 's not enough to offset the problems at Radio Shack . '' </s>
<s> Sales at Radio Shack stores open more than a year grew only 2 % in the quarter from a year earlier , he said . </s>
<s> As a result , Mr. Telzrow said he cut his fiscal 1990 per-share earnings estimate for Tandy to $ 4.05 from $ 4.20 . </s>
<s> Tandy earned $ 88.8 million , or $ 3.64 a share , in the year ended June 30 . </s>
<s> Barry Bryant , an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , said Tandy also has suffered from lethargic sales of its computers aimed at the home and small-office market , which are less-advanced and cheaper than computers aimed at the corporate market . </s>
<s> Tandy has added several new products to that line , including a laptop computer priced around $ 1,000 , and is focusing its advertising on the easy-to-use software that is packaged with its machines . </s>
<s> Mr. Bryant and other analysts hope all those moves will combine to help Tandy 's results improve in the important Christmas quarter . </s>
<s> `` They 've been promising 13 % to 15 % growth based on the strategic moves they 've made , '' he said . </s>
<s> `` If the earnings acceleration is to take place , that should be the quarter . </s>
