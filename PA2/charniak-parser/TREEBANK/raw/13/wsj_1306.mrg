<s> Tandy Corp. said it wo n't join U.S. Memories , the group that seeks to battle the Japanese in the market for computer memory chips . </s>
<s> Tandy 's decision is a second setback for U.S. Memories . </s>
<s> Last month , Apple Computer Inc. said that it would n't invest in the group . </s>
<s> Apple said that its money would be better spent in areas such as research and development . </s>
<s> U.S. Memories is seeking major investors to back its attempt to crack the $ 10 billion market for dynamic random access memory chips , a market dominated by the Japanese . </s>
<s> Those chips were in dire shortage last year , hurting many U.S. computer companies that could n't get sufficient Japanese-supplied chips . </s>
<s> Tandy said its experience during the shortage did n't merit the $ 5 million to $ 50 million investment U.S. Memories is seeking from each investor . </s>
<s> `` At this time , we elected not to get involved because we have been able to satisfy our need -LCB- for DRAMs -RCB- from the market as a rule , '' said Ed Juge , Tandy 's director of market planning . </s>
<s> Sanford Kane , U.S. Memories president , said the decision was `` disappointing , '' but does n't presage U.S. Memories ' failure . </s>
<s> `` I would like to have had them , '' he said . </s>
<s> But `` they were n't on my list of companies who were critical to be a part of it . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Kane became president and chief executive officer of U.S. Memories last June , when the group was formed by seven electronics companies : Advanced Micro Devices Inc. , Digital Equipment Corp. ; Hewlett-Packard Co. ; Intel Corp. ; International Business Machines Corp. ; LSI Logic Corp. and National Semiconductor Corp . </s>
<s> Mr. Kane said he expects two or three major corporations to announce their participation in U.S. Memories soon after the group finishes a business plan , probably late this week . </s>
<s> U.S. Memories needs a catalyst , he said , to inspire others to join . </s>
<s> But so far , most potential participants have n't decided . </s>
<s> Sun Microsystems Inc. said it 's still actively evaluating U.S. Memories and plans to meet with U.S. Memories representatives later this week . </s>
<s> American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said it was waiting to see U.S. Memories ' business plan . </s>
<s> Personal-computer maker AST Research Inc. said it is still studying the situation . </s>
<s> A Compaq Computer Corp. spokeswoman said that the company has n't made a decision yet , although `` it is n't under active consideration . </s>
