<s> As Helen Boehm , who owns an art porcelain company , sipped her luncheon cocktail , she reeled off the names of a few pals -- Prince Charles , Princess Diana , Sarah Ferguson , John Kluge , Milton Petrie . </s>
<s> Then , flashing a diamond ring as big as the Ritz -LRB- `` my day diamond , darling '' -RRB- , she told her two companions that she is on the `` board '' of the Vatican Museum in Rome . </s>
<s> As it turns out , the board has a lot of important members , including Winton Blount -LRB- former postmaster general of the U.S. -RRB- , Mrs. Henry Gaisman -LRB- widow of the inventor of auto-strop razor -RRB- and Vincent Murphy -LRB- an investment banker at Merrill Lynch & Co . -RRB- </s>
<s> But Mrs. Boehm did n't mention any of them . </s>
<s> `` Helen Boehm has a way with names , '' says James Revson , a gossip columnist for Newsday -LRB- and son of Joseph Revson , a founder of Revlon -RRB- . </s>
<s> Like which are droppable and which are not . </s>
<s> With the fall social season well under way , name-droppers are out in force , trying to impress their betters and sometimes put down their lessers . </s>
<s> But the truth is that almost everyone , from real-estate agents to city fathers , name-drops ; and a surprising number of people have an ancient uncle who claims he lived next door to the cartoonist who did the Katzenjammer Kids . </s>
<s> -LRB- In case you have forgotten , his name was Rudolph Dirks . -RRB- </s>
<s> `` Name-dropping is pervasive and getting more so as society becomes more complex and alienating , '' says Herbert Freudenberger , a New York psychoanalyst , with a high-powered clientele . </s>
<s> `` It can be an avenue of entrance to a certain sector of society ... . </s>
<s> It provides some people a needed sense of affiliation and can help open up a conversation with someone you do n't know . '' </s>
<s> Like the Long Island matron in the theater district the other day who swore to a stranger that she once met Liza Minnelli . </s>
<s> `` I was having a drink in Sardi 's , when all of a sudden I saw a woman 's backside coming up the steps on the second floor and she was wearing sequined slacks . </s>
<s> I knew it was someone important , so I followed her into the ladies room and sure enough , it was Liza . </s>
<s> So I said , ` Hello . ' </s>
<s> And she said , ` Hello . ' </s>
<s> Can you imagine ? </s>
<s> Liza said hello to me . '' </s>
<s> Some people must drop names -- call it an irresistible impulse . </s>
<s> `` They ca n't help talking about the big important people they know , even if they do n't really know them , '' says Dr. Freudenberger . </s>
<s> Beauregard Houston-Montgomery , a New York writer who changed his name from William Stretch in 1980 , is an inveterate name-dropper . </s>
<s> `` I do it innately and pathologically , and while it may occasionally get me into trouble , it 's also gotten me access to parties and society , '' he says . </s>
<s> Name-dropping recently helped Mr. Houston-Montgomery crash a party Fame magazine threw for 100 of the 2,809 people mentioned in the diaries of the late Andy Warhol . </s>
<s> `` I guess I might have asked Beauregard to leave , but he drops so many good names , we decided to let him stay , '' says Steven Greenberg , publisher of Fame . </s>
<s> `` After all , Warhol was the ultimate namedropper , dropping five a day in his diaries . </s>
<s> And Beauregard was mentioned twice -- although very briefly and in passing . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Houston-Montgomery says that at the party he waved to Malcolm Forbes , publisher of Forbes magazine -LRB- `` We've been in the columns together '' -RRB- , Mary Boone , a New York art dealer -LRB- `` I think she knows me , but I 'm not sure '' -RRB- and Bridget Fonda , the actress -LRB- `` She knows me , but we 're not really the best of friends '' -RRB- . </s>
<s> Mr. Revson , the gossip columnist , says there are people who actually plan whose names they are going to drop before attending a party . </s>
<s> These droppers do n't flaunt only their friendships with the Trumps , Brooke Astor or Georgette Mosbacher . </s>
<s> `` They even drop semi-obscure names like Wolfgang Flottl , whom everybody these days apparently has heard of but no one really knows , '' says Mr. Revson . </s>
<s> `` It 's the one-upsmanship of name-dropping that counts . '' </s>
<s> But name-dropping has other benefits , often civic . </s>
<s> In the name of civic pride and from the desire to nullify a negative image , some city promoters seek to link their municipality with the most recognizable names the city has to offer . </s>
<s> Take Cleveland . </s>
<s> It has gotten a bad rep because its once heavily polluted Cuyahoga River caught fire , because former Mayor Ralph Perk set his hair on fire with an acetylene torch and because its proposed Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame was recently refused an urban-development grant . </s>
<s> Some people call it `` The Mistake on the Lake '' -- Lake Erie , that is . </s>
<s> `` It helps to point out how many important people came through Cleveland on their way to the top , '' says George Miller , executive director of the New Cleveland Campaign , a nonprofit organization devoted to citing the city 's strengths . </s>
<s> Mr. Miller notes that actor Paul Newman 's family owned a sporting-goods store in Cleveland , that the late actress Margaret Hamilton , who played the bad witch in `` The Wizard Of Oz , '' once ran a nursery school in Cleveland and that comedian Bob Hope 's father , a stonemason , once worked on a church next to Severence Hall , Cleveland 's main concert hall . </s>
<s> `` Power names like that do n't hurt the city 's reputation , '' Mr. Miller says . </s>
<s> In Hollywood , an average family can gain cachet from moving into a home vacated by the famous or near famous . </s>
<s> `` Why we even just sold a three-bedroom house in Van Nuys and were able to keep the price firm in a weak real-estate market by noting that the original Lone Ranger lived there , '' says David Rambo , a sales associate with Jon Douglas Co. , a Los Angeles real-estate agency . </s>
<s> `` Most people ca n't even remember his name . '' </s>
<s> -LRB- It is John Hart . -RRB- </s>
<s> Mr. Rambo says that a 3.2-acre property overlooking the San Fernando Valley is priced at $ 4 million because the late actor Erroll Flynn once lived there . </s>
<s> `` If Flynn had n't lived there , the property might have been priced $ 1 million lower , '' says Mr. Rambo , noting that Flynn 's house has been bulldozed , and only the swimming pool remains . </s>
<s> Press agents and public-relations practitioners are notorious name-droppers . </s>
<s> And some even do it with malice aforethought . </s>
<s> Len Kessler , a financial publicist in New York , sometimes uses it to get the attention of journalists who try to avoid him . </s>
<s> He says that when Dan Dorfman , a financial columnist with USA Today , has n't returned his phone calls , he leaves messages with Mr. Dorfman 's office saying that he has an important story on Donald Trump , Meshulam Riklis or Marvin Davis . </s>
<s> He admits he has no story on any of them on these occasions . </s>
<s> `` But it does get him to return my calls , and it makes me feel better for the times he 's given me the brushoff , '' Mr. Kessler says . </s>
<s> There are , of course , obvious dangers to blatant , unsubstantiated name-dropping . </s>
<s> Jeffry Thal , a publicity agent for the Lantz Office in Los Angeles , warns that dropping the wrong name labels the dropper as a fake and a fraud . </s>
<s> `` Get caught and you 're dead in the water , '' says Mr. Thal . </s>
<s> Mr. Thal says that Elizabeth Taylor , a client , `` hates being called ` Liz . ' ... </s>
<s> If directors or producers phone me and say they know ` Liz , ' I know they 've never met her . </s>
<s> She prefers ` Elizabeth . ' '' </s>
<s> In New York society , Pat Buckley , the very social wife of author William Buckley , has the nicknames `` Mrs. Buckles '' and `` Patsy . '' </s>
<s> And her husband sometimes calls her `` Ducky . '' </s>
<s> `` But call her ` Patty , ' and it 's a sure giveaway you 're not in her circle , because she does n't use that name , '' says Joan Kron , editor-in-chief of Avenue magazine , a monthly publication sent to all the right names . </s>
<s> John Spencer Churchill , a nephew of the late Sir Winston Churchill , former prime minister of Great Britain , is n't that impressed with most name-droppers he meets . </s>
<s> That 's because they only drop `` mere names , '' says Mr. Churchill . </s>
<s> Currently writing his memoirs , Mr. Churchill , an artist , tells how tycoons such as the late Jean Paul Getty , the oil billionnaire , were , in fact , known only by one initial , their last . </s>
<s> `` When you 're at the club , you ask whether they 've spoken to ` G . ' </s>
<s> Now they know who you mean and you know who you mean . </s>
<s> But no one else does . </s>
<s> Now that 's name-dropping , if you know what I mean . </s>
