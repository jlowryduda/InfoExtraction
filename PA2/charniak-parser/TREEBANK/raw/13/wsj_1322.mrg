<s> The bond market , which sometimes thrives on bad news , cheered yesterday 's stock market sell-off and perceptions that the economy is growing weaker . </s>
<s> Early in the day , bonds rose modestly on economists ' forecasts that this week 's slate of economic data will portray an economy headed for trouble . </s>
<s> Such news is good for bonds because economic weakness sometimes causes the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates in an effort to stimulate the economy and stave off a recession . </s>
<s> For example , today the Department of Commerce is scheduled to release the September durable goods report . </s>
<s> The consensus forecast of 14 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report is for a 1.2 % drop in September orders . </s>
<s> That would follow a 3.9 % advance in August . </s>
<s> Bonds received a bigger boost later in the day when stock prices moved broadly lower . </s>
<s> The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 26.23 points to 2662.91 . </s>
<s> `` Bond investors have been watching stocks closely , '' said Joel Marver , chief fixed-income analyst at Technical Data Global Markets Group . </s>
<s> `` When you get a big sell-off in equities , money starts to shift into bonds , '' which are considered safer , he said . </s>
<s> The Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond ended about 1\/2 point higher , or up about $ 5 for each $ 1,000 face amount , while the yield slid to 7.93 % from 7.98 % Friday . </s>
<s> Municipals ended mixed , while mortgage-backed and investment-grade corporate bonds rose . </s>
<s> Prices of high-yield , high-risk corporate securities ended unchanged . </s>
<s> In more evidence of the growing division between `` good '' and `` bad '' junk bonds , a $ 150 million issue by Imo Industries Inc. was snapped up by investors while underwriters for Beatrice Co. 's $ 350 million issue are considering restructuring the deal to attract buyers . </s>
<s> In the Treasury market , analysts expect bond prices to trade in narrow ranges this week as the market takes in positive and negative news . </s>
<s> `` On the negative side , the market will be affected by constant supply in all sectors of the market , '' said William M. Brachfeld , economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc . </s>
<s> `` On the other hand , we have economic news that is -LCB- expected to be -RCB- relatively positive for the bond market . </s>
<s> We will go back and forth with a tilt toward slightly lower yields , '' he said . </s>
<s> Today , the Treasury will sell $ 10 billion of new two-year notes . </s>
<s> Tomorrow , Resolution Funding Corp. , a division of a new government agency created to bail out the nation 's troubled thrifts , will hold its first bond auction at which it will sell $ 4.5 billion of 30-year bonds . </s>
<s> So far , money managers and other bond buyers have n't shown much interest in the Refcorp bonds . </s>
<s> Analysts have mixed views about the two-year note auction . </s>
<s> While some say the auction should proceed smoothly , others contend that yesterday 's sale of $ 2.58 billion of asset-backed securities by Ford Motor Credit Corp. may have siphoned some potential institutional buyers from the government 's note sale . </s>
<s> The division of auto maker Ford Motor Co. made its debut in the asset-backed securities market with the second-largest issue in the market 's four-year history . </s>
<s> The company offered securities backed by automobile loans through an underwriting group headed by First Boston Corp . </s>
<s> The issue yields 8.90 % and carries a guarantee covering 9 % of the deal from the company . </s>
<s> First Boston sweetened the terms from the original yield estimate in an apparent effort to place the huge offering . </s>
<s> The issue was offered at a yield nearly one percentage point above the yield on two-year Treasurys . </s>
<s> The only asset-backed deal larger than Ford 's was a $ 4 billion offering by General Motors Acceptance Corp. in 1986 . </s>
<s> Treasury Securities </s>
<s> Treasury bonds were 1\/8 to 1\/2 point higher yesterday in light trading . </s>
<s> The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 102 3\/32 , compared with 101 17\/32 Friday . </s>
<s> The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at 100 17\/32 to yield 7.90 % , compared with 100 3\/32 to yield 7.97 % . </s>
<s> The latest two-year notes were quoted late at 100 28\/32 to yield 7.84 % . </s>
<s> Short-term rates rose yesterday at the government 's weekly Treasury bill auction , compared with the previous bill sale . </s>
<s> The Treasury sold $ 7.81 billion of three-month bills with an average discount rate of 7.52 % , the highest since the average of 7.63 % at the auction on Oct. 10 . </s>
<s> The $ 7.81 billion of six-month Treasury bills were sold with an average discount rate of 7.50 % , the highest since the average of 7.60 % at the Oct. 10 auction . </s>
<s> The rates were up from last week 's auction , when they were 7.37 % and 7.42 % , respectively . </s>
<s> Here are auction details : </s>
<s> Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value . </s>
<s> Thus , higher bidding narrows the investor 's return while lower bidding widens it . </s>
<s> The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year , while the coupon-equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year . </s>
<s> Both issues are dated Oct. 26 . </s>
<s> The 13-week bills mature Jan. 25 , 1990 , and the 26-week bills mature April 26 , 1990 . </s>
<s> Corporate Issues </s>
<s> Investment-grade corporates closed about 1\/4 point higher in quiet trading . </s>
<s> In the junk bond market , Imo Industries ' issue of 12-year debentures , considered to be one of the market 's high-quality credits , was priced at par to yield 12 % . </s>
<s> Peter Karches , managing director at underwriter Morgan Stanley & Co. , said the issue was oversubscribed . </s>
<s> `` It 's a segmented market , and if you have a good , strong credit , people have an appetite for it , '' he said . </s>
<s> Morgan Stanley is expected to price another junk bond deal , $ 350 million of senior subordinated debentures by Continental Cablevision Inc. , next Tuesday . </s>
<s> In light of the recent skittishness in the high-yield market , junk bond analysts and traders expect other high-yield deals to be sweetened or restructured before they are offered to investors . </s>
<s> In the case of Beatrice , Salomon Brothers Inc. is considering restructuring the reset mechanism on the $ 200 million portion of the offering . </s>
<s> Under the originally contemplated terms of the offering , the notes would have been reset annually at a fixed spread above Treasurys . </s>
<s> Under the new plan being considered , the notes would reset annually at a rate to maintain a market value of 101 . </s>
<s> Price talk calls for the reset notes to be priced at a yield of between 13 1\/4 % and 13 1\/2 % . </s>
<s> Mortgage-Backed Securities </s>
<s> Activity in derivative markets was strong with four new real estate mortgage investment conduits announced and talk of several more deals in today 's session . </s>
<s> The Federal National Mortgage Association offered $ 1.2 billion of Remic securities in three issues , and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. offered a $ 250 million Remic backed by 9 % 15-year securities . </s>
<s> Part of the reason for the heavy activity in derivative markets is that underwriters are repackaging mortgage securities being sold by thrifts . </s>
<s> Traders said thrifts have stepped up their mortgage securities sales as the bond market has risen in the past two weeks . </s>
<s> In the mortgage pass-through sector , active issues rose but trailed gains in the Treasury market . </s>
<s> Government National Mortgage Association 9 % securities for November delivery were quoted late yesterday at 98 10\/32 , up 10\/32 ; and Freddie Mac 9 % securities were at 97 1\/2 , up 1\/4 . </s>
<s> The Ginnie Mae 9 % issue was yielding 8.36 % to a 12-year average life assumption , as the spread above the Treasury 10-year note widened slightly to 1.46 percentage points . </s>
<s> Municipals </s>
<s> A $ 575 million San Antonio , Texas , electric and gas system revenue bond issue dominated the new issue sector . </s>
<s> The refunding issue , which had been in the wings for two months , was one of the chief offerings overhanging the market and limiting price appreciation . </s>
<s> But alleviating that overhang failed to stimulate much activity in the secondary market , where prices were off 1\/8 to up 3\/8 point . </s>
<s> An official with lead underwriter First Boston said orders for the San Antonio bonds were `` on the slow side . '' </s>
<s> He attributed that to the issue 's aggressive pricing and large size , as well as the general lethargy in the municipal marketplace . </s>
<s> In addition , he noted , the issue would normally be the type purchased by property and casualty insurers , but recent disasters , such as Hurricane Hugo and the Northern California earthquake , have stretched insurers ' resources and damped their demand for bonds . </s>
<s> A $ 137.6 million Maryland Stadium Authority sports facilities lease revenue bond issue appeared to be off to a good start . </s>
<s> The issue was oversubscribed and `` doing very well , '' according to an official with lead underwriter Morgan Stanley . </s>
<s> Activity quieted in the New York City bond market , where heavy investor selling last week drove yields on the issuer 's full faith and credit backed bonds up as much as 0.50 percentage point . </s>
<s> Foreign Bonds </s>
<s> Japanese government bonds ended lower after the dollar rose modestly against the yen . </s>
<s> The turnaround in the dollar fueled bearish sentiment about Japan 's bond market . </s>
<s> The benchmark No. 111 4.6 % bond due 1998 ended on brokers ' screens at a price of 95.39 , off 0.28 . </s>
<s> The yield rose to 5.38 % . </s>
<s> West German bond prices ended lower after a day of aimless trading . </s>
<s> The benchmark 7 % bond due October 1999 fell 0.20 point to 99.80 to yield 7.03 % , while the 6 3\/4 % notes due July 1994 fell 0.10 to 97.65 to yield 7.34 % . </s>
<s> British government bonds ended slightly higher in quiet trading as investors looked ahead to today 's British trade report . </s>
<s> The benchmark 11 3\/4 % Treasury bond due 2003\/2007 rose 1\/8 to 111 21\/32 to yield 10.11 % , while the 12 % issue of 1995 rose 3\/32 to 103 23\/32 to yield 11.01 % . </s>
