<s> Ralph Brown was 31,000 feet over Minnesota when both jets on his Falcon 20 flamed out . </s>
<s> At 18,000 feet , he says , he and his co-pilot `` were looking for an interstate or a cornfield '' to land . </s>
<s> At 13,000 feet , the engines restarted . </s>
<s> But knowing that mechanics would probably ground him for repairs , Mr. Brown skipped his stop in nearby Chicago and set course to get his load -- a few hundred parcels -- to the Memphis package-sorting hub on time . </s>
<s> Had he been a little less gung-ho , `` I 'd have gotten the thing on the ground and headed for the nearest bar , '' Mr. Brown says . </s>
<s> But he flies for Federal Express Corp. , perhaps the closest thing in corporate America to the Green Berets . </s>
<s> Federal 's employees work long hours and seem to thrive on the stress of racing the clock . </s>
<s> Like Mr. Brown , they sometimes go to surprising lengths to meet that overarching corporate goal : delivering the goods on time . </s>
<s> They are a tribute to Federal 's management which , since the company 's founding 16 years ago , has had its way with its work force -- an unusual feat in the contentious transportation industry . </s>
<s> That may soon change . </s>
<s> This month , Federal 's 2,048 pilots , including some 961 acquired along with Tiger International Inc. in February , will decide whether to elect the powerful Air Line Pilots Association as their bargaining agent . </s>
<s> The election , which would bring the first major union to Federal 's U.S. operations , has pitted new hires against devoted veterans such as Mr. Brown . </s>
<s> It has also rattled Federal 's strongly anti-union management , which is already contending with melding far-flung operations and with falling profits . </s>
<s> `` A union , sooner or later , has to have an adversary , and it has to have a victory , '' Frederick W. Smith , Federal 's chairman and chief executive , says with disdain . </s>
<s> `` In our formula , we do n't have any losers except the competition . '' </s>
<s> What managers really fear is that the pro-union movement could spread beyond the pilots . </s>
<s> Under federal transportation law , a government mediator is attempting to reconcile the melding of Tiger 's job classifications into Federal 's . </s>
<s> Depending on the outcome , the merged company may face union elections this fall among airplane mechanics , ramp workers , stock clerks and flight dispatchers . </s>
<s> These groups constitute up to 10 % of its work force . </s>
<s> `` Unions would have a profound effect on the whole culture of the company , '' says Bernard La Londe , a professor at Ohio State University at Columbus and a Federal consultant . </s>
<s> That culture , carefully crafted by Mr. Smith , leaves little , if any , room for unions . </s>
<s> Since founding the company , the charismatic Vietnam vet , who is still only 46 years old , has fostered an ethos of combat . </s>
<s> Flights are `` missions . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Smith 's managers have , at times , been called `` Ho Chi Minh 's Guerrillas . '' </s>
<s> The Bravo Zulu award , the Navy accolade for a `` job well done , '' is bestowed on Federal 's workers who surpass the call of duty . </s>
<s> Competitors are known as the `` enemy . '' </s>
<s> To reinforce employees ' dedication , Mr. Smith pays well . </s>
<s> He also lets workers vent steam through an elaborate grievance procedure and , as a perk , fly free in empty cockpit seats . </s>
<s> He gives pep talks in periodic `` family briefings '' beamed internationally on `` FXTV , '' the company 's own television network . </s>
<s> And , with many of his 70,000 workers , Mr. Smith 's damn-the-torpedoes attitude has caught on . </s>
<s> James Cleveland , a courier who earned a Bravo Zulu for figuring out how to get a major customer 's 1,100-parcel-a-week load to its doorstep by 8 a.m. , considers himself far more than a courier . </s>
<s> `` We do n't just hand the customer the package . </s>
<s> That 's just the beginning , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` In essence , we run the show . '' </s>
<s> David Sanders , a longtime pilot , bristles at the mere suggestion that a union might tamper with his flight schedule . </s>
<s> `` This is America , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` Nobody has the right to tell me how much I can work . '' </s>
<s> Such attitudes have given Federal flexibility , not only to rapidly implement new technology but to keep its work force extraordinarily lean . </s>
<s> The company deliberately understaffs , stretching employees ' schedules to the limit . </s>
<s> But though couriers work as many as 60 hours a week during the autumn rush , they leave early during slack times while still being assured of a minimum paycheck . </s>
<s> Pilots , as well , routinely fly overtime to ensure that none are furloughed during seasonal lows . </s>
<s> The operational freedom has also given Federal a leg up on archrival United Parcel Service Inc. , the nation 's largest employer of United Brotherhood of Teamsters members . </s>
<s> UPS wo n't discuss its labor practices , but , according to Mr. Cleveland , a former UPS employee , and others , union work rules prohibit UPS drivers from doing more than carrying packages between customers and their vans . </s>
<s> Because UPS drivers are n't permitted to load their own vehicles at the depot , say these couriers , packages often get buried in the load and are delivered late . </s>
<s> Labor problems are the last thing Mr. Smith needs right now . </s>
<s> Although the Tiger acquisition has brought Federal a long way toward becoming the global player it wants to be , it also has brought problems . </s>
<s> It more than doubled Federal 's long-term debt to $ 1.9 billion , thrust the company into unknown territory -- heavy cargo -- and suddenly expanded its landing rights to 21 countries from four . </s>
<s> Federal , on its own , had n't been doing very well overseas . </s>
<s> It had hemorrhaged in its attempt to get into Asia , where treaty restrictions forced it to fly some planes half-empty on certain routes . </s>
<s> On routes to South America , the company had no backup jets to ensure delivery when planes were grounded . </s>
<s> In Europe , business suffered as Federal bought several local companies , only to have the managers quit . </s>
<s> These and other problems squeezed Federal 's profit margins last year to 8 % , down from more than 13 % annually in the first half of the decade . </s>
<s> Earnings have plummeted , too , in each of the past three quarters . </s>
<s> In the fiscal first period ended Aug. 31 , profit fell 54 % to $ 30.4 million , or 58 cents a share , mostly because of the Tiger merger , Federal says . </s>
<s> Federal 's stock price , however , has held up well , driven in part by the general run-up of airline stocks , analysts say . </s>
<s> Since trading as low as $ 42.25 a share in May , Federal 's shares have rallied as high as $ 57.87 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading . </s>
<s> They closed Friday at $ 53.25 , down 50 cents on the day . </s>
<s> There 's a certain irony in the fact that Federal Express faces its first union problems as a result of its Tiger purchase . </s>
<s> Tiger itself was founded by a band of gungho airmen who had airlifted supplies `` over the Hump '' from India to China during World War II . </s>
<s> In the early 1970s , Mr. Smith modeled his fledgling company on Tiger 's innovation of hub-and-spoke and containerized-cargo operations . </s>
<s> But from early on , Tiger 's workers unionized , while Federal 's never have . </s>
<s> Federal Express officials acknowledge mistakes in their drive overseas but say it will pay off eventually . </s>
<s> Analysts expect Federal 's earnings to improve again in its fiscal third quarter ending Feb. 28 , when the company should begin benefiting from Tiger 's extra flights , back-up planes and landing rights . </s>
<s> Until then , they expect the cost of integrating the two carriers to continue crimping profits . </s>
<s> For now , the union issue is the most nettlesome of Federal 's Tiger problems , management believes . </s>
<s> Although encouraging dialogue between managers and workers , Mr. Smith does n't countenance what he considers insubordination . </s>
<s> When a large group of pilots once signed petitions opposing work-rule and compensation changes , he called a meeting in a company hangar and dressed them down for challenging his authority . </s>
<s> He then made most of the changes , pilots say . </s>
<s> That sort of approach , however , has n't worked since the addition of Tiger . </s>
<s> Its 6,500 workers , who had battled Tiger 's management for years over givebacks , were union members until the day of the merger , when most of their unions were automatically decertified . </s>
<s> Soon after the merger , moreover , Federal 's management asked Tiger 's pilots to sign an agreement stating that they could be fired any time , without cause or notice . </s>
<s> When the pilots refused , the company retracted it . </s>
<s> Mr. Smith angered Federal 's pilots , too . </s>
<s> In his haste to seal the deal with Tiger Chairman Saul Steinberg last August , Mr. Smith ignored a promise that he had made to his own pilots three years ago : that any fliers acquired in future mergers would be `` end-tailed '' -- put at the bottom of the pilot seniority list that determines work schedules , pay and career options . </s>
<s> The Tiger merger agreement stipulated that the lists be combined on the basis of tenure . </s>
<s> Mr. Smith is trying hard to allay the anger . </s>
<s> And even some pro-union pilots say his charisma and popularity among the many former military fliers could be tough to beat . </s>
<s> `` A lot of people are identifying a vote for representation as a vote against Fred Smith , '' says J.X. Gollich , a Tiger-turned-Federal pilot and union activist . </s>
<s> Mr. Smith and other top Federal executives have met with Tiger workers in Los Angeles , Ohio , New York , Alaska , Asia and Europe . </s>
<s> Recently , they have appeared every few weeks in talk-show type videos , countering pro-union arguments . </s>
<s> In one video , Mr. Smith defended his agreement to merge the pilot-seniority lists . </s>
<s> He said Mr. Steinberg had insisted that the merger talks move quickly . </s>
<s> Regulators , as well , might have quashed the deal if Tiger 's pilots had n't been protected , he said . </s>
<s> Furthermore , Mr. Smith added , `` our contract with our pilots says that we will manage our fleet operations with their advice . </s>
<s> It does n't give any particular group the ability to veto change . '' </s>
<s> Already , the fight has been costly . </s>
<s> The seniority-list controversy , along with the job-classification dispute , has been turned over to the mediator . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , the company is operating with two separate pilot groups and seniority lists , and that is costing Federal `` a big number , '' says James Barksdale , executive vice president and chief operating officer . </s>
<s> The issue has also cost Federal management a lot of good will among its old pilots . </s>
<s> `` They were willing to mistreat us because we had n't shown any moxie , any resistance , '' says William Queenan , a DC-10 pilot and 14-year Federal veteran . </s>
<s> Adds John Poag , a 727 captain and past chairman of the company-sponsored Flight Advisory Board : `` They 've made all these magnanimous gestures to the Flying Tiger pilots , and for us , nothing . '' </s>
<s> Such animosity could prove pivotal in the union vote . </s>
<s> A large majority of the 961 former Tiger fliers support the union , according to a union study . </s>
<s> But though most of the 1,087 Federal pilots are believed opposed , it is unclear just how much their loyalty to Mr. Smith has been eroded . </s>
<s> The fight has turned ugly and , among pilots at least , has shattered the esprit de corps that Mr. Smith worked so hard to build . </s>
<s> Anti-union pilots have held ballot-burning parties . </s>
<s> Some younger pilots say they have had to endure anti-union harangues by senior pilots while flying across the country . </s>
<s> And for now , at least , the competition is n't the only enemy . </s>
<s> Barney Barnhardt , a 727 captain and leader of the pro-union forces , said he has received two anonymous death threats and been challenged to a fight with tire irons by a colleague . </s>
<s> `` The pilots are either for us or extremely against us , '' he says with a sigh . </s>
