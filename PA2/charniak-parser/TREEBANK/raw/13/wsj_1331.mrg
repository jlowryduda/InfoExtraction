<s> GAF , Part III is scheduled to begin today . </s>
<s> After two mistrials , the stakes in the stock manipulation trial of GAF Corp. and its vice chairman , James T. Sherwin , have changed considerably . </s>
<s> The first two GAF trials were watched closely on Wall Street because they were considered to be important tests of the government 's ability to convince a jury of allegations stemming from its insider-trading investigations . </s>
<s> In an eight-count indictment , the government charged GAF , a Wayne , N.J. , chemical maker , and Mr. Sherwin with illegally attempting to manipulate the common stock of Union Carbide Corp. in advance of GAF 's planned sale of a large block of the stock in 1986 . </s>
<s> The government 's credibility in the GAF case depended heavily on its star witness , Boyd L. Jefferies , the former Los Angeles brokerage chief who was implicated by former arbitrager Ivan Boesky , and then pointed the finger at Mr. Sherwin , takeover speculator Salim B. Lewis and corporate raider Paul Bilzerian . </s>
<s> The GAF trials were viewed as previews of the government 's strength in its cases against Mr. Lewis and Mr. Bilzerian . </s>
<s> Mr. Jefferies 's performance as a witness was expected to affect his sentencing . </s>
<s> But GAF 's bellwether role was short-lived . </s>
<s> The first GAF trial ended in a mistrial after four weeks when U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe found that a prosecutor improperly , but unintentionally , withheld a document . </s>
<s> After 93 hours of deliberation , the jurors in the second trial said they were hopelessly deadlocked , and another mistrial was declared on March 22 . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , a federal jury found Mr. Bilzerian guilty on securities fraud and other charges in June . </s>
<s> A month later , Mr. Jefferies was spared a jail term by a federal judge who praised him for helping the government . </s>
<s> In August , Mr. Lewis pleaded guilty to three felony counts . </s>
<s> Nevertheless , the stakes are still high for the players directly involved in the GAF case . </s>
<s> The mistrials have left the reputations of GAF , Mr. Sherwin and GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman in limbo . </s>
<s> For Mr. Sherwin , a conviction could carry penalties of five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine on each count . </s>
<s> GAF faces potential fines of $ 500,000 for each count . </s>
<s> Individuals familiar with the case said that throughout September , defense attorneys were talking with the government in an effort to prevent a trial , but by the end of the month the talks had ended . </s>
<s> There is much speculation among attorneys not involved that the strategy of GAF 's attorney , Arthur Liman , and Mr. Sherwin 's counsel , Stephen Kaufman , will include testimony by Mr. Sherwin or Mr. Heyman . </s>
<s> Neither testified at the previous trials . </s>
<s> For now , defense attorneys are tight-lipped about their plans . </s>
<s> Max Gitter , another GAF defense attorney , said yesterday , `` As we go in for the third time , Yogi Berra 's famous line is apt : ` It 's deja vu all over again . ' '' </s>
<s> DALKON SHIELD CLAIMANTS hope to stop reorganization-plan appeal . </s>
<s> Attorneys for more than 18,000 women who claim injuries from the Dalkon Shield contraceptive device have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to refuse to hear an appeal of the bankruptcy-law reorganization plan for A.H. Robins Co. , which manufactured the device . </s>
<s> The dispute pits two groups of claimants against each other . </s>
<s> Baltimore attorney Michael A. Pretl and 17 other attorneys representing 18,136 claimants in the U.S. and abroad argue that the appeal would delay -- and perhaps even destroy -- a $ 2.38 billion settlement fund that is the centerpiece of the reorganization plan . </s>
<s> The bankruptcy-court reorganization is being challenged before the Supreme Court by a dissident group of claimants because it places a cap on the total amount of money available to settle claims . </s>
<s> It also bars future suits against Robins company officials , members of the Robins family and Robins 's former insurer , Aetna Life & Casualty Co . </s>
<s> The latter provision is `` legally unprecedented , '' said Alan B. Morrison , a public interest lawyer in Washington , D.C. , who is challenging the plan on behalf of 900 claimants . </s>
<s> More than 100,000 claims against Robins are pending . </s>
<s> The company made and marketed the Dalkon Shield in the early 1970s amid mounting evidence that it could cause serious injuries . </s>
<s> Robins has been in proceedings under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since August 1985 ; such proceedings give it protection from creditor lawsuits while it works out a plan for paying its debts . </s>
<s> American Home Products Corp. wants to acquire Robins , but only if all legal challenges to the plan are exhausted . </s>
<s> In a brief filed with the Supreme Court last week , Mr. Pretl criticizes the appeal for raising `` abstract '' and `` theoretical '' legal issues , while jeopardizing the proposed reorganization and the settlement payments to claimants . </s>
<s> The Supreme Court is scheduled to consider the case Nov. 3 and may issue a decision as early as Nov. 6 . </s>
<s> JURY 'S CRIMINAL CONVICTION under Superfund law is a first . </s>
<s> Charles A. Donohoo , sole proprieter of a Louisville , Ky. , demolition company , was found guilty of violating the Superfund law as well as the Clean Air Act . </s>
<s> Criminal convictions under the federal Superfund law are rare , and the decision is the first jury verdict in such a case . </s>
<s> Under Superfund , those who owned , generated or transported hazardous waste are liable for its cleanup , regardless of whether their actions were legal at the time . </s>
<s> Environmental lawyers say virtually all of the Superfund cases to date have involved civil penalties designed to insure cleanup of past polluting activities . </s>
<s> But Superfund also contains a criminal provision concerning the release of toxic substances into the environment . </s>
<s> In 1986 Congress strengthened the penalty by making it a felony . </s>
<s> Mr. Donohoo was convicted in Louisville late last month of violating Superfund by failing to report the release of asbestos into the environment from a building he was demolishing . </s>
<s> He was also convicted of failing to properly remove asbestos from the building , a violation of the Clean Air Act . </s>
<s> The government sought a criminal penalty because `` no cleanup is possible here . </s>
<s> Once -LCB- asbestos -RCB- is released into the environment , it can lodge anywhere , '' says Richard A. Dennis , the assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted the case . </s>
<s> Mr. Donohoo is scheduled to be sentenced Dec. 11 . </s>
<s> His lawyer could not be reached for comment . </s>
<s> Mr. Donohoo faces as much as three years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine for the Superfund conviction and as much as one year in prison and a $ 100,000 fine for the violation of the Clean Air Act . </s>
<s> TED BUNDY'S LAWYERS switch to victims ' side in death-sentence case . </s>
<s> Wilmer , Cutler & Pickering , the Washington , D.C. , law firm that spent over $ 1 million fighting the execution of mass-murderer Ted Bundy -- who eventually was executed -- has taken on another death penalty case before the Supreme Court , this time on the side of the family of four murder victims in Arkansas . </s>
<s> The law firm has filed a friend-of-the-court brief jointly with the Washington Legal Foundation , a conservative legal group . </s>
<s> The key issue in the case , which the law firm is handling without a fee , or pro bono , is whether a person sentenced to death can voluntarily waive his rights of appellate review . </s>
<s> The murderer , Ronald Gene Simmons , was convicted of killing 14 people . </s>
<s> Another murderer on death row has appealed Mr. Simmons 's death sentence in a `` next friend '' capacity . </s>
<s> Wilmer Cutler 's brief argues that there is no mandatory appellate review of capital sentences and that the inmate who filed the appeal lacks proper standing . </s>
<s> P.J. Mode , Wilmer Cutler 's managing partner , says the trial team that represented Mr. Bundy was asked by the firm 's pro bono committee whether the new case posed a conflict and that no objections were raised . </s>
<s> The coupling of the law firm and the Washington Legal Foundation is odd also , because Wilmer Cutler was one of the firms singled out for criticism two years ago by the conservative legal group for displaying a liberal bias in its pro bono work . </s>
<s> `` We give them a lot of credit for taking this case , '' says WLF 's Alan Slobodin . </s>
<s> THE CASE OF THE FAKE DALIS : </s>
<s> In federal court in Manhattan , three defendants pleaded guilty to charges of fraud in connection with the sale of fake Salvador Dali lithographs . </s>
<s> James Burke and Larry Evans , formerly owners of the now-defunct Barclay Gallery , and Prudence Clark , a Barclay sales representative , were charged with conducting high-pressure telephone sales in which they misrepresented cheap copies of Dali artwork as signed , limited-edition lithographs . </s>
<s> The posters were sold for $ 1,300 to $ 6,000 , although the government says they had a value of only $ 53 to $ 200 apiece . </s>
<s> Henry Pitman , the assistant U.S. attorney handling the case , said about 1,000 customers were defrauded and that Barclay 's total proceeds from the sales were $ 3.4 million . </s>
<s> Attorneys for Messrs. Burke and Evans and Ms. Clarke said that although their clients admitted to making some misrepresentations in the sales , they had believed that the works were authorized by Mr. Dali , who died in January . </s>
<s> The posters were printed on paper pre-signed by Mr. Dali , the attorneys said . </s>
