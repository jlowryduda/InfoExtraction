<s> When Robert McDuffie was 14 , he got a chance to play in the starting lineup for his high school basketball team in Macon , Ga . </s>
<s> Unfortunately , his mother had tickets for a recital by Itzhak Perlman the same night , and she was adamant about his attending . </s>
<s> `` I threw such a fit , '' says Mr. McDuffie , who had begun violin studies at the age of six . </s>
<s> `` But once Perlman started playing , I did n't give a damn about basketball ... . </s>
<s> Afterwards , I went home and practiced for three hours . '' </s>
<s> Today , it 's obvious that the brawny , six-foot , one-inch musician made the right choice . </s>
<s> At 31 , Mr. McDuffie has a rich , full-bodied tone , an admirable rhythmic precision and an increasingly busy schedule . </s>
<s> He 's currently in the midst of a 17-city U.S. tour with Yehudi Menuhin and the Warsaw Sinfonia , with stops including Charleston , S.C . -LRB- Oct. 25 -RRB- , Sarasota , Fla . -LRB- Oct. 28 -RRB- , Tampa , Fla . -LRB- Oct. 29 -RRB- and Miami -LRB- Oct. 31 -RRB- . </s>
<s> Later this season he gives a recital at Washington 's Kennedy Center , and appears as soloist with several major orchestras . </s>
<s> Yet Mr. McDuffie 's career has developed at a slower pace than those of some of his better known contemporaries . </s>
<s> During the late 1970s , he was part of a musical `` brat pack '' -- a group of budding virtuosos who studied at the Juilliard School with the noted pedagogue Dorothy DeLay . </s>
<s> His violin classmates included Shlomo Mintz , a protege of Isaac Stern who performed with major orchestras while still a student ; Cho-Liang Lin , who joined the roster of ICM Artists Inc. at the age of 18 ; and Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg , who launched her career by winning the 1981 Naumberg Competition . </s>
<s> `` I thought I was over the hill at 22 , '' recalls Mr. McDuffie , an outgoing man with pale blue eyes and a light Southern drawl . </s>
<s> `` But I was n't ready for a career at that time . '' </s>
<s> Young McDuffie 's first violin teacher was Henrik Schwarzenberger , a Hungarian refugee who taught in the Macon public school system . </s>
<s> `` He taught me how to play like a gypsy , '' jokes the musician . </s>
<s> `` I did n't learn to count until I got to Juilliard . '' </s>
<s> After studies at that conservatory 's Pre-College Division with an assistant to the legendary instructor Ivan Galamian , he switched at the college level to Miss DeLay , Mr. Galamian 's longtime assistant and , ultimately , his rival . </s>
<s> `` I think I had to prove myself to her , '' says Mr. McDuffie . </s>
<s> `` But she was always encouraging . </s>
<s> She only put her foot down twice , '' he continues . </s>
<s> `` In my freshman year , my roommate was known as a party animal . </s>
<s> She thought I was n't getting my practicing done . '' </s>
<s> As the violinist tells it , his grandmotherly looking teacher `` put her hands on her hips , stomped her foot and said , ` You 've just got to get the -LCB- expletive deleted -RCB- out of there . ' '' </s>
<s> The second incident took place after Mr. McDuffie gave an ambitious student recital and was feeling rather pleased with himself . </s>
<s> Miss DeLay requested that he come to her studio with a tape of the recital . </s>
<s> `` We listened to the Chausson ` Poeme , ' '' he recalls , `` and she said , ` You hear the first note , that B-flat ? </s>
<s> That 's the only note that 's truly in tune ... ' . '' </s>
<s> `` That 's the most important experience I 've had with any teacher , '' he says , `` because she taught me how to listen . </s>
<s> Now , when I play with orchestras , the musicians often compliment me on my intonation . '' </s>
<s> It was also at Juilliard that Mr. McDuffie discovered his predilection for conservative , 20th-century American composers such as David Diamond and Samuel Barber . </s>
<s> After winning a school competition with a performance of the latter 's `` Violin Concerto , '' Mr. McDuffie was invited to play the work for the composer , who was dying of cancer . </s>
<s> `` Barber was seated by the fireplace looking very pale , '' recalls the violinist , who performed the work with a piano accompanist at the composer 's apartment . </s>
<s> `` He did n't say much , but what he said was important because it 's not in the score . </s>
<s> There 's a beautiful , Coplandesque motif -- he 'd kill me if he heard me say that -- throughout the first movement ... </s>
<s> The only time the violin has it is right at the end . </s>
<s> It 's written ` marcato ' in the score , and I played it that way , kind of gigue-like . </s>
<s> And he yelled out ` dolce ! dolce ! ' -LCB- ` sweet ! sweet ! ' -RCB- . '' </s>
<s> `` So we did it over , '' he adds . </s>
<s> `` I played very transparently , with the tip of the bow . </s>
<s> If a conductor is sensitive enough to bring down the orchestra -LCB- volume -RCB- at that point , it makes the piece magical . </s>
<s> I do n't know why Barber never told anybody else . </s>
<s> On Isaac Stern 's recording it 's very biting . '' </s>
<s> Since leaving Juilliard , Mr. McDuffie has made some smart moves and some controversial ones . </s>
<s> His guest appearance on the NBC soap opera `` Another World , '' scandalized musical elitists . </s>
<s> By contrast , he 's won kudos for his espousal of William Schuman 's `` Violin Concerto , '' which he recently recorded for Angel\/EMI along with Leonard Bernstein 's engaging `` Serenade for Violin Solo , Strings and Percussion . '' </s>
<s> Mr. McDuffie 's sweet tone , heartfelt lyricism and rhythmic punch make him an ideal interpreter of both works . </s>
<s> Aided by the fluid playing of the St. Louis Symphony under Leonard Slatkin 's direction , this `` Serenade '' really swings . </s>
<s> Mr. Schuman 's `` Violin Concerto , '' which sounds more like a mildly atonal rhapsody for solo violin with orchestral accompaniment , meanders until the propulsive `` Agitato , fervente . '' </s>
<s> But there are ample rewards in its plaintive slow sections and virtuoso fireworks for soloist , brass and timpani . </s>
<s> At Avery Fisher Hall here , Mr. McDuffie was heard recently with Mr. Menuhin and the Warsaw Sinfonia in more conventional fare -- Bruch 's overwrought `` Violin Concerto in G Minor . '' </s>
<s> His performance was so effusive and driven that the phrases rarely breathed . </s>
<s> The 35-member Sinfonia played adroitly with a big , lush sound that belied its size . </s>
<s> Whatever he plays , Mr. McDuffie finds satisfaction in the music itself -- `` something greater out there than me , '' as he puts it during an interview at the Manhattan apartment he shares with wife , Camille , a literary publicist . </s>
<s> `` A normal person did not write the Beethoven ` Violin Concerto , ' '' he declares . </s>
<s> `` Even when I hear it played badly , I 'm still humbled by the piece . </s>
<s> If I could ever feel I 've contributed to it in some way , then all the hard work has been worth it . '' </s>
