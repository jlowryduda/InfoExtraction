<s> Japan is going on a capital-spending binge that could make its trade surpluses even harder to shrink . </s>
<s> Its capital spending is growing at double-digit rates for the second year in a row , and its superefficient producers of everything from cars to computer chips are rushing to expand capacity , modernize factories and develop new products . </s>
<s> `` The boom 's so huge , '' says Mitsuru Saito , an economist at Sanwa Research Institute , `` it makes you think of the Golden '60s , '' when Japan developed rapidly . </s>
<s> The more factories and robots Japanese manufacturers add , the more they will be able to export , and the less their domestic customers will need to import . </s>
<s> At Canon Inc. , for example , sales are up nearly 20 % this year ; so , the maker of cameras and computer printers is doing what any Japanese company would do under the circumstances : It is increasing capital spending -- by 60 % . </s>
<s> It is building , among other things , a new laser-beam-printer factory in western Japan that can produce up to 150,000 printers next year . </s>
<s> Some 70 % of them are to be exported to the U.S. . </s>
<s> Even companies in smokestack industries wrestling with world-wide overcapacity are joining the boom . </s>
<s> Japan 's steelmakers are raising capital spending 22 % this year to $ 4.8 billion . </s>
<s> Hitachi Zosen Corp. , a shipbuilder buried in debt just a few years ago , will build a machinery plant , its first expansion in 14 years . </s>
<s> So big is the capital-spending boom that Japanese companies ' outlays in Japan topped American companies ' domestic outlays by $ 521.4 billion to $ 494.8 billion in the 12 months ended March 31 even though Japan 's total output of goods and services is less than two-thirds America 's . </s>
<s> From a financial standpoint , the boom could n't come at a better time . </s>
<s> Many Japanese companies expect record profits this fiscal year , and Japanese interest rates , though up a bit recently , are still low . </s>
<s> And in a business system where shareholders have few rights and expect only modest dividends , companies can plow their profits back into plant and equipment . </s>
<s> But some economists and government officials here are n't applauding . </s>
<s> They fear that the boom may be too big for Japan 's or anyone else 's good . </s>
<s> `` It 's an explosive cocktail '' thrown at the world , says Kenneth Courtis , senior economist at the Tokyo unit of Deutsche Bank Group . </s>
<s> The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is so concerned that it recently took the unusual step of urging Japanese auto companies to exercise caution in capital spending . </s>
<s> MITI officials hope to avoid yet-another source of trade friction with the U.S. even though export restraints currently limit Japanese car exports to the U.S. . </s>
<s> Not everyone is worried , however . </s>
<s> Some economists -- and many Japanese companies -- are puzzled by the warnings . </s>
<s> The investment boom is mainly sparked , they say , by strong domestic demand and is n't likely to increase exports sharply . </s>
<s> Moreover , much investment is n't aimed at increasing capacity . </s>
<s> According to a survey of some 2,400 large companies by the Japan Development Bank , expanded capacity is the goal of just 51.8 % of the outlays ; for manufacturers alone , the figure is 32 % . </s>
<s> The manufacturers said 14.2 % of their spending is designed to improve products or add new ones , 17.5 % is to cut costs , 12.5 % is for research and development , and the rest is for maintenance and other purposes . </s>
<s> But the worriers remain unconvinced . </s>
<s> With Japan running enormous trade surpluses against much of the world , they think that Japan should meet the increased domestic demand by importing more . </s>
<s> And eventually , they contend , domestic demand will weaken , forcing companies to emphasize exports again . </s>
<s> `` If there 's a further drive to export , '' says Nobuyuki Arai , an economist at the Japan Development Bank , `` that 'll be a problem . '' </s>
<s> Even in the short run , the investment boom could exacerbate a disturbing trend : Japanese exports are showing surprisingly little tendency to ease . </s>
<s> Japanese auto makers , for example , are increasing their production capacity in the U.S. ; the additional production should , in part , replace imported vehicles with locally manufactured ones . </s>
<s> But although Japanese companies increased their U.S. auto output by 42 % from January to September compared with the year-earlier period , their exports to the U.S. will drop only 9 % this year , Nikko Research Center estimates . </s>
<s> In contrast to previous economic booms , Japanese auto companies are n't just trying to boost production . </s>
<s> Many are pouring money into developing high-quality products to target affluent consumers and , to some extent , to avoid direct combat with cheaper cars from South Korea and Taiwan . </s>
<s> Others are replacing older facilities with flexible assembly lines on which different models can be turned out at once . </s>
<s> So many companies are investing in high-tech machinery that Fanuc Ltd. , a robot maker , also had to build a new plant . </s>
<s> The buildup is `` making Japan clearly more efficient , more technologically advanced and more competitive , '' declares a Western diplomat in Tokyo . </s>
<s> But whatever its effects on exports and imports , Japan 's investment boom during the past two years has been stimulated at least partly by soaring domestic demand . </s>
<s> Japan 's marathon economy , growing at 4.3 % this year , is now in its 35th month of expansion , and some economists are betting that the boom will outlast the record 57-month expansion in the late 1960s . </s>
<s> Japanese consumers are increasingly eager to spend their money , especially on high-priced goods such as 29-inch television sets and luxury cars . </s>
<s> Nissan Motor Co. 's domestic auto sales are up 20 % this year largely because its expensive Cima , Sylvia and Cefiro models are in heavy demand . </s>
<s> `` One dealer told me that if he had more cars , he 'd sell them right away , '' says Takuro Endo , Nissan executive vice president . </s>
<s> He adds that the company is trying to keep up with demand `` by overworking '' its employees . </s>
<s> Similarly , Honda Motor Co. 's sales are so brisk that workers grumble they have n't had a Saturday off in years , despite the government 's encouragement of more leisure activity . </s>
<s> With demand growing and workers in short supply , many Japanese manufacturers are spending heavily on automation . </s>
<s> Among them are the shipbuilders , which had halved their shipyard work forces to cut costs during a prolonged slump in demand but now are capturing an increased share of the strengthening global market . </s>
<s> Sasebo Heavy Industries Co. , a medium-sized shipbuilder , expects its sales to increase 30 % this year , largely because of rising demand for oil tankers . </s>
<s> Once one Japanese company steps up its investments , the whole industry follows . </s>
<s> Because most businesses put market share above profitability , to let a competitor 's addition to capacity go unmatched is to concede defeat . </s>
<s> The emphasis on market share is evident at Daikin Industries Ltd. , Japan 's biggest maker of industrial air conditioners . </s>
<s> Seeing new office buildings sprout up and its sales soar , Daikin is building another plant , which will lift its production capacity 50 % . </s>
<s> The expansion is aimed not just at meeting demand but also at expanding the company 's market share to 30 % from 27 % currently . </s>
<s> Besides , Daikin 's major competitors , Hitachi Ltd. and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. , `` are all adding production lines , '' a Daikin spokesman says . </s>
<s> `` Until now , we were trying to increase productivity with the facilities we already had . </s>
<s> But we ca n't produce enough anymore . '' </s>
<s> The competition is even more heated in the auto industry , where companies are racing one another in a world-wide market . </s>
<s> Nissan aims to expand its 25 % share of the market to 30 % by spending $ 141 million on a plant in southern Japan that could make as many as 240,000 cars a year . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , Toyota Motor Corp. 's $ 247 million buildup is increasing its annual capacity by 180,000 cars , and Honda is spending $ 317 million on expansion . </s>
<s> Mazda Motor Corp. is still considering its options , but it boldly aims to double its annual domestic sales to 800,000 cars in the next four years . </s>
<s> Those who are n't worried about how Japanese manufacturers ' investments will affect trade note that many new products are n't replacements for imports . </s>
<s> Although imports account for less than 1 % of beer sales in Japan , Asahi Breweries Ltd. , which has been gaining share with its popular dry beer , plans to fend off Japanese competitors by pouring $ 1.06 billion into facilities to brew 50 % more beer . </s>
<s> But new-product development will make Japanese companies stronger , and big investments in `` domestic '' industries such as beer will make it even tougher for foreign competitors to crack the Japanese market . </s>
<s> Moreover , much of the investment boom is in high-tech fields in which Japanese companies have only limited foreign competition ; so , more investment practically assures more exports . </s>
<s> Toshiba Corp. , for example , is spending $ 986 million on two new plants to build four-megabit dynamic random access memories , the next generation of computer chips . </s>
<s> The product is n't widely used yet , but Toshiba , which has already beaten everyone else in producing the current-generation one-megabit DRAMs , believes that its early investment will heighten its chances of beating its competitors again . </s>
<s> `` It 's important to gain leadership , '' a Toshiba spokesman says . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , Toshiba 's Japanese rivals , Hitachi , Fujitsu Ltd. and NEC Corp. , are n't sitting still . </s>
<s> After doubling production in one plant , NEC is spending $ 275 million to build another plant that , in two years , will be able to make a million four-megabit DRAMs a year . </s>
<s> The new chip plants `` wo n't be excessive investment , '' says Hajime Sasaki , an NEC vice president . </s>
<s> `` We have enough products to make and the markets to sell these products . '' </s>
<s> Some of Japan 's goods being produced as a result of the investment boom are already successful overseas . </s>
<s> Toyota 's $ 35,000 Lexus automobile , a luxury model that it started shipping to the U.S. only last month , is racking up orders at a time when U.S.-made luxury-car sales are slow . </s>
<s> Toyota plans to raise Lexus exports when a new plant starts up next year . </s>
<s> What if its sales weaken someday ? </s>
<s> Japanese companies have a caveat competitor attitude . </s>
<s> If excess capacity develops , they say , not everyone will suffer . </s>
<s> The losers will be those with the least attractive products , and many of them , analysts think , will be foreign companies . </s>
