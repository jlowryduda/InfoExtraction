<s> Eavesdropping -- both corporate and private -- is on the rise , thanks to the proliferation of surveillance technologies . </s>
<s> And while sellers of the equipment and companies `` monitoring '' employees have few qualms , right-to-privacy advocates and some lawmakers are alarmed . </s>
<s> `` New technologies are changing the way we deal with each other and the way we work , '' says Janlori Goldman , a staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union . </s>
<s> `` Our expectation of confidentiality is being eroded . '' </s>
<s> On the corporate side , companies claim that monitoring employee phone conversations is both legal and necessary to gauge productivity and ensure good service . </s>
<s> The practice is common at catalog , insurance and phone companies , banks and telemarketers , according to trade groups and worker organizations . </s>
<s> It 's also widespread for reservations clerks in the airline , car-rental , hotel and railroad industries . </s>
<s> The Communications Workers of America , which opposes such monitoring , says supervisors listen in on an estimated 400 million calls each year . </s>
<s> Among companies saying they monitor employees are United Airlines , American Airlines , United Parcel Service , Nynex Corp. , Spiegel Inc. , and the circulation department of this newspaper . </s>
<s> Some Wall Street firms monitor for recordkeeping purposes . </s>
<s> Dictaphone Corp. says there 's a big business demand for its voice-activated taping systems , whether the sophisticated Veritrac 9000 system , which costs from $ 10,000 to $ 120,000 and can record 240 conversations simultaneously , or simple handheld units selling for $ 395 . </s>
<s> Businesses `` want to verify information and ensure accuracy , '' says John Hiltunen , Dictaphone 's manager of media relations . </s>
<s> The state of Alaska recently bought the Veritrac system , he says , `` to monitor the Exxon cleanup effort . '' </s>
<s> Merrill Lynch & Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. say they use voice-activated systems to record and verify orders between salesmen and traders . </s>
<s> Shearson says it has taped some of its institutional trading desks , such as commodities and futures , for about four years . </s>
<s> Both companies stress that employees know they are being recorded and that customer conversations are n't taped . </s>
<s> Kidder Peabody & Co. says it monitors bond-trading conversations between brokers and customers to safeguard order accuracy . </s>
<s> Eavesdropping by individuals is harder to measure . </s>
<s> But devices are there for the asking , whether in stores or through the mail . </s>
<s> The Counter Spy Shop in Washington , D.C. , for instance , offers the `` Secret Connection '' attache case , which can surreptitiously record conversations for nine hours at a stretch . </s>
<s> That and other fancy gizmos may cost thousands , but simple voice-activated tape recorders sell for as little as $ 70 at electronics stores like Radio Shack . </s>
<s> The most common use of spying devices is in divorce cases , say private investigators . </s>
<s> While tape recordings to uncover , say , infidelity are n't admissible in court , they can mean leverage in a settlement . </s>
<s> Concerned with the increased availability of surveillance technology and heavier use of it , lawmakers have proposed laws addressing the issue . </s>
<s> Nine states have introduced bills requiring that workers and customers be made aware of monitoring . </s>
<s> And four states -- California , Florida , Michigan and Pennsylvania -- have adopted rules that all parties involved must consent when phone calls are recorded . </s>
<s> Two bills in Congress hope to make such restrictions national . </s>
<s> In May , Rep. Don Edwards -LRB- D. Calif . -RRB- introduced congressional legislation that would require an audible beeping during any employee monitoring , warning people that they are being heard . </s>
<s> -LRB- The legislation is similar to a 1987 `` beeper bill '' that was defeated after heavy lobbying by the telemarketing industry . -RRB- </s>
<s> Also last spring , Rep. Ron Dellums -LRB- D. , Calif. -RRB- , introduced a bill requiring universal two-party consent to any tapings in cases that do n't involve law enforcement . </s>
<s> In addition , products such as voice-activated tape recorders would have to include beep tones and labels explaining federal laws on eavesdropping . </s>
<s> The outlook on both federal bills is uncertain , especially remembering the 1987 defeat . </s>
<s> The ACLU and worker organizations back tighter laws , but employers and device manufacturers object . </s>
<s> `` I 'm sympathetic with workers who feel under the gun , '' says Richard Barton of the Direct Marketing Association of America , which is lobbying strenuously against the Edwards beeper bill . </s>
<s> `` But the only way you can find out how your people are doing is by listening . '' </s>
<s> The powerful group , which represents many of the nation 's telemarketers , was instrumental in derailing the 1987 bill . </s>
<s> Spiegel also opposes the beeper bill , saying the noise it requires would interfere with customer orders , causing irritation and even errors . </s>
<s> Laura Dale , center manager at the catalog company 's customer order center in Reno , Nev. , defends monitoring . </s>
<s> `` We like to follow up and make sure operators are achieving our standards of company service , '' says Ms. Dale , who supervises 350 operators . </s>
<s> John Bonomo , a Nynex spokesman , says the telephone company needs to monitor operators to evaluate performance during the first six months on the job . </s>
<s> `` Sometimes , '' he says , `` we 'll pull someone off the phones for more training . '' </s>
<s> Federal wiretap statutes recognize the right of employers to monitor employees ' for evaluation purposes . </s>
<s> And in the past , Congress has viewed monitoring as an issue best handled in union negotiations . </s>
<s> But opponents , led by the CWA , say new laws are needed because monitoring is heavily concentrated in service industries and 81 % of monitored workers are n't represented by unions . </s>
<s> The CWA claims that monitoring not only infringes on employee privacy , but increases stress . </s>
<s> `` Nine to Five , '' a Cleveland-based office workers organization that supports the beeper bill , six months ago started a privacy hot line to receive reports of alleged monitoring abuses . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , supporters of the Dellums two-party consent bill say it is needed because of a giant loophole in the one-party consent law . </s>
<s> Currently , if the person taping is a party to the conversation , it 's all right to record without the knowledge of the other person on the line . </s>
<s> -LRB- Intercepting other people 's private conversations is illegal and punishable by five years in prison and fines of $ 10,000 . -RRB- </s>
<s> The electronics industry is closely following the Dellums bill . </s>
<s> Some marketers of surveillance gear -- including Communication Control System Ltd. , which owns the Counter Spy Shop and others like it -- already put warning labels in their catalogs informing customers of the one-party law . </s>
<s> But vendors contend that they ca n't control how their products are used . </s>
<s> Radio Shack says it has a policy against selling products if a salesperson suspects they will be used illegally . </s>
<s> `` Everything sold at Radio Shack has a legal purpose , '' says Bernard Appel , president of the Tandy Corp. subsidiary . </s>
<s> He says he has n't yet studied the Dellums bill , but that requiring a beeping tone on recorders `` would be ludicrous . '' </s>
<s> Still , Radio Shack is aware that some of its products are controversial . </s>
<s> A few years ago , the company voluntarily stopped selling `` The Big Ear , '' a powerful microphone . </s>
<s> With its ability to pick up rustlings and flapping wings , `` it was meant to be a toy for children for bird watching , '' says Mr. Appel . </s>
<s> `` But we were getting too many complaints that people were using them to eavesdrop on their neighbors . '' </s>
