<s> Columbia Savings & Loan Association , reeling from thrift-accounting changes mandated by Congress and the recent collapse of the junk-bond market , announced a loss for the third quarter of $ 226.3 million , or $ 11.57 a share . </s>
<s> For the quarter a year ago , Columbia reported earnings of $ 16.3 million , or 37 cents a share . </s>
<s> Total assets increased to $ 12.7 billion in the latest quarter from $ 12.4 billion a year earlier . </s>
<s> The loss stems from $ 357.5 million of write-downs on Columbia 's $ 4.4 billion high-yield investment securities portfolio , which includes about $ 3.7 billion of junk bonds , $ 400 million of preferred stock , and Treasury securities . </s>
<s> Columbia owes its spectacular growth in recent years to its junk-bond portfolio , the largest of any U.S. thrift . </s>
<s> Much of Columbia 's junk-bond trading has been done through the high-yield department of its Beverly Hills neighbor , Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc . </s>
<s> For the nine months , losses totaled $ 212 million , or $ 10.83 a share , compared with net income of $ 48.7 million , or $ 1.11 a share , a year earlier . </s>
<s> The results include a $ 130.2 million write-down of the securities in the high-yield portfolio to the lower of their cost or market value . </s>
<s> Columbia also added $ 227.3 million to reserves for losses on the portfolio , increasing general reserves to $ 300 million , or about 6.7 % of the total portfolio , as of Sept. 30 . </s>
<s> On June 30 , loss reserves stood at $ 108.3 million . </s>
<s> Thrift officials said the $ 300 million reserve will be adjusted quarterly and will reflect the rate of dispositions and market conditions . </s>
<s> The adjustments result from the recently passed thrift-industry bailout legislation , which requires thrifts to divest all high-yield bond investments by 1994 . </s>
<s> Previously , Columbia did n't have to adjust the book value of its junk-bond holdings to reflect declines in market prices , because it held the bonds as long-term investments . </s>
<s> Because Columbia now must sell the bonds within five years , accounting rules require the thrift to value the bonds at the lower of cost or market prices . </s>
<s> For its future strategy , Columbia officials said the thrift may branch out into commercial lending or managing outside investments , as well as beefing up more traditional thrift activities . </s>
<s> The quarterly results also reflected $ 21.4 million in non-recurring losses from commercial real-estate activities in California . </s>
<s> Thomas Spiegel , Columbia 's chairman , said in a statement that the thrift was `` disappointed '' by the effects of the accounting changes . </s>
<s> But he said Columbia remains `` one of the most strongly capitalized thrifts in the industry , '' based on the economic value of its assets and tangible capital . </s>
<s> Columbia announced the results after the close of the stock market . </s>
<s> Its shares closed at $ 5.125 each in composite New York Stock Exchange trading , down 37.5 cents . </s>
<s> The price of Columbia shares has been cut nearly in half since August , when they traded at about $ 10 , as investors apparently realized that the thrift would be forced to take a big write-down . </s>
<s> The stock 's decline accelerated in the past two weeks , from a price of $ 8 a share on Oct. 9 . </s>
<s> Columbia officials said they do n't know how quickly they will dispose of the thrift 's junk bonds , because federal regulations , such as those that would allow thrifts to continue holding the bonds in separately capitalized subsidiaries , have n't yet been completed . </s>
<s> Columbia officials also said the thrift should n't face problems meeting regulatory capital requirements , despite the large reserves and write-downs and stiffer regulatory requirements that should be in place by year 's end . </s>
<s> Its ratio of tangible equity to total assets as of Sept. 30 was 3.6 % , and total equity was $ 457.9 million . </s>
<s> The thrift emphasized that it has a large portfolio of equity securities issued in connection with corporate restructurings and leveraged buy-outs , which has a book value of $ 90 million . </s>
<s> Although many of the transactions related to those securities have n't been completed , Columbia said the ultimate gain on the sale of those assets will range from $ 200 million to $ 300 million . </s>
<s> Columbia also has unrealized gains in its public equity securities portfolio of more than $ 70 million . </s>
