<s> Bullish bond market sentiment is on the rise again . </s>
<s> As the government prepares to release the next batch of economic reports , the consensus among economists and money managers is that the news will be negative . </s>
<s> And that , they say , will be good for bonds . </s>
<s> `` Recent data have indicated somewhat weaker economic activity , '' said Elliott Platt , director of economic research at Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities . </s>
<s> Mr. Platt is advising clients that `` the near-term direction of bond prices is likely to remain upward . '' </s>
<s> Analysts insist that even without help from a shaky stock market , which provided a temporary boost for bonds during the Oct. 13 stock market plunge , bond prices will start to climb on the prospects that the Federal Reserve will allow interest rates to move lower in the coming weeks . </s>
<s> That would be comforting to fixed-income investors , many of whom were badly burned in the third quarter by incorrectly assuming that the Fed would ease . </s>
<s> Investors rushed to buy bonds during the summer as prices soared on speculation that interest rates would continue to fall . </s>
<s> But when it became clear that rates had stabilized and that the Fed 's credit-easing policy was on hold , bond yields jumped and prices tumbled . </s>
<s> Long-term bonds have performed erratically this year . </s>
<s> For example , a group of long-term Treasury bonds tracked by Merrill Lynch & Co. produced a total return of 1 % in the first quarter , 12.45 % in the second quarter and -0.06 % in the third quarter . </s>
<s> Total return is price changes plus interest income . </s>
<s> Now some investment analysts insist that the economic climate has turned cold and gloomy , and they are urging clients to buy bonds before the rally begins . </s>
<s> Among other things , economists note that consumer spending is slowing , corporate profit margins are being squeezed , business confidence is slipping and construction and manufacturing industries are depressed . </s>
<s> At the same time , last week 's consumer price index showed that inflation is moderating . </s>
<s> Add it all up and it means `` that the Fed has a little leeway to ease its credit policy stance without the risk of rekindling inflation , '' said Norman Robertson , chief economist at Mellon Bank Corp. , Pittsburgh . </s>
<s> `` I think we will see a federal funds rate of close to 8 1\/2 % in the next two weeks and 8 % by year end . '' </s>
<s> The federal funds rate , which banks charge each other on overnight loans , is considered an early signal of changes in the Fed 's credit policy . </s>
<s> Economists generally agree that the rate was lowered by the Fed from around 9 % , where it had been since July , to about 8 3\/4 % in early October on the heels of a weak employment report . </s>
<s> Although the rate briefly drifted even lower following the stock market sell-off that occurred Oct. 13 , it ended Friday at about 8 11\/16 % . </s>
<s> James Kochan , chief fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch , is touting shorter-term securities , which he says should benefit more quickly than longer-term bonds as interest rates fall . </s>
<s> `` Given our forecast for lower rates , purchases made now should prove quite rewarding before year end , '' he said . </s>
<s> Mr. Kochan also likes long-term , investment-grade corporate bonds and long-term Treasurys . </s>
<s> He says these bonds should appreciate in value as some investors , reacting to the recent turmoil in the stock and high-yield junk bond markets , seek safer securities . </s>
<s> `` If the -LCB- Tennessee Valley Authority -RCB- sale is any guide , there appears to be good demand for top-quality , long-term paper from both domestic and overseas accounts , '' he said . </s>
<s> TVA , in its first public debt offering in 15 years , sold $ 4 billion of long-term and intermediate-term securities last week . </s>
<s> Strong investor demand prompted the utility to boost the size of the issue from $ 3 billion . </s>
<s> TVA , which operates one of the nation 's largest electric power systems , is a corporation owned by the federal government . </s>
<s> But persuading investors to buy bonds may be especially tough this week , when the U.S. government will auction more than $ 30 billion of new securities . </s>
<s> Today , the Treasury Department will sell $ 15.6 billion of three-month and six-month bills at the regular weekly auction . </s>
<s> Tomorrow , the Treasury will sell $ 10 billion of two-year notes . </s>
<s> Resolution Funding Corp. , known as Refcorp , a division of a new government agency created to bail out the nation 's troubled savings and loan associations , will hold its first bond auction Wednesday , when it will sell $ 4.5 billion of 30-year bonds . </s>
<s> All of this comes ahead of the government 's big quarterly refunding of the federal debt , which takes place sometime in November . </s>
<s> So far , investors have n't shown much appetite for Refcorp 's initial bond offering . </s>
<s> Roger Early , a portfolio manager at Federated Investors Corp. , said that yields on the so-called bailout bonds are n't high enough to attract his attention . </s>
<s> `` Why should I bother with something that 's an unknown for a very small pickup in yield ? '' he said . </s>
<s> `` I 'm not going to jump on them the first day they come out . '' </s>
<s> He seems to be typical of many professional money managers . </s>
<s> When the size of the Refcorp offering was announced last week and when-issued trading activity began , the bailout bonds were yielding about 1\/20 percentage point more than the Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond . </s>
<s> On Friday , the yield was quoted at about 1\/4 percentage point higher than the benchmark bond , an indication of weak demand . </s>
<s> Some economists believe that yields on all Treasury securities may rise this week as the market struggles to absorb the new supply . </s>
<s> But once the new securities are digested , they expect investors to focus on the weak economic data . </s>
<s> `` The supply is not a constraint to the market , '' said Samuel Kahan , chief financial economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc . </s>
<s> `` If one thinks that rates are going down , you do n't care how much supply is coming . '' </s>
<s> Friday 's Market Activity </s>
<s> Most bond prices fell on concerns about this week 's new supply and disappointment that stock prices did n't stage a sharp decline . </s>
<s> Junk bond prices moved higher , however . </s>
<s> In early trading , Treasury bonds were higher on expectations that a surge in buying among Japanese investors would continue . </s>
<s> Also providing support to Treasurys was hope that the stock market might see declines because of the expiration of some stock-index futures and options on indexes and individual stocks . </s>
<s> Those hopes were dashed when the stock market put in a relatively quiet performance . </s>
<s> Treasury bonds ended with losses of as much as 1\/4 point , or about $ 2.50 for each $ 1,000 face amount . </s>
<s> The benchmark 30-year bond , which traded as high as 102 1\/4 during the day , ended at 101 17\/32 . </s>
<s> The yield on the benchmark bond rose slightly to 7.98 % from 7.96 % . </s>
<s> In the corporate bond market , traders said the new-issue market for junk bonds is likely to pick up following Chicago & North Western Acquisition Corp. 's $ 475 million junk bond offering Friday . </s>
<s> Today , for example , underwriters at Morgan Stanley & Co. said they expect to price a $ 150 million , 12-year senior subordinated debenture offering by Imo Industries Inc . </s>
<s> Traders expect the issue to be priced to yield 12 % . </s>
<s> Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said that a $ 150 million senior subordinated discount debenture issue by R.P. Scherer Drugs is expected by the end of the month . </s>
<s> However , despite the big new-issue calendar , many junk bond investors and analysts are skeptical the deals will get done . </s>
<s> `` There are about a dozen more deals coming , '' said Michael McNamara , director of fixed-income research at Kemper Financial Services Inc . </s>
<s> `` If they had this much trouble with Chicago & North Western , they are going to have an awful time with the rest . '' </s>
<s> Last week , underwriters were forced to postpone three junk bond deals because of recent weakness in the market . </s>
<s> And pressure by big investors forced Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. to sweeten Chicago & North Western 's $ 475 million junk bond offering . </s>
<s> After hours of negotiating that stretched late into Thursday night , underwriters priced the 12-year issue of resettable senior subordinated debentures at par to yield 14.75 % , higher than the 14.5 % that had been expected . </s>
<s> The coupon on the issue will be reset in one year at a rate that will give the issue a market value of 101 . </s>
<s> However , the maximum coupon rate on the issue when it is reset is 15.50 % . </s>
<s> Debenture holders also will receive the equivalent of 10 % of the common stock in Chicago & North Western 's parent company . </s>
<s> `` The coupon was raised to induce some of the big players on the fence to come in , '' said a spokesman for Donaldson . </s>
<s> `` We put a price on the deal that the market required to get it done . '' </s>
<s> The spokesman said the issue was sold out and met with strong interest abroad , particularly from Japanese investors . </s>
<s> In the secondary , or resale , market , junk bonds closed 1\/2 point higher , while investment-grade corporate bonds fell 1\/8 to 1\/4 point . </s>
