<s> Oil Spill Case Shows Liability Fund Flaws </s>
<s> AN UNRESOLVED two-year-old dispute stemming from an Alaskan oil spill has helped spur a drive for tougher federal laws to protect victims of such accidents . </s>
<s> The class-action suit highlights shortcomings of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Liability Fund , which gets its money from oil companies using the pipeline and compensates those harmed by oil spills . </s>
<s> On July 2 , 1987 , the tanker S.S. Glacier Bay struck a rock and spilled almost 150,000 gallons of oil into the Cook Inlet . </s>
<s> Commercial fishermen and fish processors filed suit in federal court in a claim that has ballooned to more than $ 104.8 million . </s>
<s> Defendants include British Petroleum America ; Trinidad Corp. , the shipper ; and the pipeline liability fund . </s>
<s> The fund was created by the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Act , which provides that the owner or operator of a vessel involved in an oil spill must pay the first $ 14 million in damages . </s>
<s> The fund is required to pay claims up to an additional $ 86 million . </s>
<s> The fund 's purpose is to provide quick and adequate relief . </s>
<s> But the Glacier Bay case , the fund 's first test , shows how easily the fund can be undermined . </s>
<s> Trinidad Corp. is contesting liability . </s>
<s> It claims the Coast Guard failed to chart the rock and refuses to pay damages . </s>
<s> That means the fund is n't obligated to pay anything , at least so far . </s>
<s> The Oil Pollution Act , scheduled to come up for a vote in Congress this fall , would provide that if claimants are n't paid within 90 days of a spill , the liability fund would compensate them and seek reimbursement from the owner or operator of the vessel , says a spokesman for Rep. George Miller -LRB- D. , Calif. -RRB- , a sponsor of the bill . </s>
<s> The spokesman says the `` glitch '' in the statute is `` the worst kind of Catch-22 . '' </s>
<s> Many Law School Grads Find Classes Never End </s>
<s> RECENT LAW school graduates are starting jobs with law firms this fall -- and heading back to class . </s>
<s> Bar associations and consultants are offering more programs to teach associates all they need to know about law but did n't learn in law school . </s>
<s> `` Law school teaches wonderful theory , but it does n't teach the nuts and bolts of practical lawyering , '' says Aaron Weitz , head of a New York County Lawyers ' Association committee that sponsors such a course . </s>
<s> In the past , associates learned the basics from senior lawyers who acted as mentors . </s>
<s> But these days , large firms hire as many as 30 new associates a year , and it 's impossible to personally train everyone , says Joel Henning of Hildebrandt Inc. , a consulting firm that runs training classes . </s>
<s> The Hildebrandt course enables students to brush up on negotiation skills by role playing in simulated deals . </s>
<s> Students also are taught to return clients ' phone calls immediately and to treat the support staff with respect . </s>
<s> Many law firms sponsor their own programs . </s>
<s> At the Baltimore firm of Weinberg & Green , new corporate and banking associates are required to enroll in a 20-class course . </s>
<s> Partners lecture on how to form corporations , draft agreements and defend clients against unwanted tender offers . </s>
<s> Now , clients know that new associates have had some practical training before working on their cases , says James J. Hanks , a partner at the firm . </s>
<s> Los Angeles Creates A Courthouse for Kids </s>
<s> THE CHILDREN of Los Angeles will soon have their own $ 52 million courthouse . </s>
<s> The building , which will handle child abuse , custody and foster care cases , will be `` less formal , less threatening and just basically less grim than most courthouses , '' says Edmund Edelman , chairman of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors . </s>
<s> Designs call for an L-shaped structure with a playground in the center . </s>
<s> There will be recreation and movie rooms . </s>
<s> Teens will be able to listen to music with headsets . </s>
<s> Study halls , complete with reference materials , will be available . </s>
<s> And there will be a nurse 's station and rooms for children to meet with social workers . </s>
<s> The building 's 25 courtrooms will be smaller , says Charlene Saunders , a court administrator . </s>
<s> The bench will be lower so the judge seems less intimidating , and walls will be painted in bright colors and covered with murals . </s>
<s> Cases in Los Angeles County involving dependent children are usually heard in the Criminal Courts Building . </s>
<s> `` We need to get the kids away from the criminals into a less traumatic environment , '' says Mr. Edelman . </s>
<s> About 45,000 children in Los Angeles County are under court supervision , Mr. Edelman says , and an average of 1,500 new children are added each month . </s>
<s> The courthouse , to be built in Monterey Park , is expected to open in the spring of 1992 . </s>
<s> Law Firm Management Can Be Quite Rewarding </s>
<s> IT PAYS to follow a management career path -- even at law firms . </s>
<s> That 's the conclusion of a recent study of large law firms conducted by Altman & Weil Inc. , an Ardmore , Pa. , law firm consultant . </s>
<s> Its survey of 96 firms , each with 100 to 1,000 lawyers , shows that managing partners earned an average of $ 395,974 in compensation and cash benefits in the firms ' 1988 fiscal years . </s>
<s> Managing partners who responded to the survey typically spend over half their time supervising their firms ' day-to-day operations and just a little more than a third of their time practicing law . </s>
<s> Partners in the survey who devote most of their time to practicing law earned an average of about $ 217,000 . </s>
