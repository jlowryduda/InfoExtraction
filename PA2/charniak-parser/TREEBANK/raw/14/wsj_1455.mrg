<s> Sitting at the bar of the Four Seasons restaurant , architect William McDonough seems oblivious to the glamorous clientele and the elegant setting . </s>
<s> He is ogling the curtains rippling above the ventilation ducts . </s>
<s> `` Look how much air is moving around ! '' he says . </s>
<s> `` The ventilation here is great ! '' </s>
<s> You may be hearing more about the 38-year-old Mr. McDonough and his preoccupation with clean air . </s>
<s> After years of relative obscurity , he is starting to attract notice for the ecological as well as the aesthetic quality of his architecture . </s>
<s> Mr. McDonough believes that the well-being of the planet depends on such stratagems as opening windows to cut indoor air pollution , tacking down carpets instead of using toxic glues , and avoiding mahogany , which comes from endangered rain forests . </s>
<s> He has put some of his aesthetic ideas into practice with his design of the four-star Quilted Giraffe restaurant -- `` architecturally impeccable , '' Progressive Architecture magazine called it -- and his remodeling of Paul Stuart , the Madison Avenue clothing store . </s>
<s> He has designed furniture and homes as well as commercial and office space . </s>
<s> He is now designing a Broadway stage set for a show by the band Kid Creole and the Coconuts . </s>
<s> What really stirs his muse , though , is aerobic architecture . </s>
<s> Now the question is : Is Poland ready for it ? </s>
<s> Mr. McDonough is about to tackle his biggest clean-air challenge yet , the proposed Warsaw Trade Center in Poland , the first such center in Eastern Europe . </s>
<s> The project has already acquired a certain New York cachet . </s>
<s> Bloomingdale 's plans to sell a foot-tall chocolate model of the center during the holidays . </s>
<s> Some of the sales proceeds will go to the Design Industries Foundation for AIDS . </s>
<s> A cake topped with a replica of the center will be auctioned at an AIDS benefit at Sotheby 's in December . </s>
<s> If Mr. McDonough 's plans get executed , as much of the Polish center as possible will be made from aluminum , steel and glass recycled from Warsaw 's abundant rubble . </s>
<s> A 20-story mesh spire will stand atop 50 stories of commercial space . </s>
<s> Solar-powered batteries will make the spire glow . </s>
<s> The windows will open . </s>
<s> The carpets wo n't be glued down , and walls will be coated with nontoxic finishes . </s>
<s> To the extent that the $ 150 million budget will allow it , Mr. McDonough will rely on solid wood , rather than plywood or particle board , to limit the emission of formaldehyde . </s>
<s> If Mr. McDonough has his way , the Poles will compensate for the trade center 's emissions of carbon dioxide , a prime suspect in the global atmospheric warming many scientists fear . </s>
<s> The Poles would plant a 10-square-mile forest somewhere in the country at a cost of $ 150,000 , with the center 's developer footing the bill . </s>
<s> The news has n't exactly moved others in Mr. McDonough 's profession to become architectural Johnny Appleseeds . </s>
<s> All architects want to be aware of the ecological consequences of their work , says John Burgee , whose New York firm is designing the redevelopment of Times Square , `` but we ca n't all carry it to that extreme . '' </s>
<s> Karen Nichols , senior associate at Michael Graves 's architecture firm in Princeton , N.J. , says : `` We 're really at the mercy of what the construction industry can and will do readily . '' </s>
<s> Mr. McDonough responds : `` I 'm asking people to broaden their agendas . '' </s>
<s> The son of a Seagram 's executive who was stationed in many countries around the world , Mr. McDonough was born in Tokyo and attended 19 schools in places ranging from Hong Kong to Shaker Heights , Ohio , before entering Dartmouth College . </s>
<s> He earned a master 's degree in architecture from Yale . </s>
<s> His interest in the natural environment dates from his youth . </s>
<s> He and his father still spend time each summer fly-fishing for salmon in Iceland . </s>
<s> Living in Hong Kong , he says , made him sensitive to the limits on food , power and water supplies . </s>
<s> At his first school in the U.S. he was thought a little strange for shutting off open water taps and admonishing his schoolmates to take only brief showers . </s>
<s> He and a Dartmouth roommate established a company that restored three hydroelectric power plants in Vermont . </s>
<s> At Yale , he designed one of the first solarheated houses to be built in Ireland . </s>
<s> Mr. McDonough 's first professional project fully to reflect his environmental ardor was his 1986 design for the headquarters of the Environmental Defense Fund in New York . </s>
<s> The offices took 10,000 square feet of a building with 14-foot ceilings and big , operable windows . </s>
<s> Since the 1970s energy crisis , some efforts to conserve energy by sealing buildings have had an unintended side effect : high indoor pollution . </s>
<s> To reduce it at the fund 's building , workers rubbed beeswax instead of polyurethane on the floors in the executive director 's office . </s>
<s> Jute , rather than a synthetic material , lies under the tacked-down carpets , and the desks are of wood and granite instead of plastic . </s>
<s> The budget was only $ 400,000 . </s>
<s> `` Athens with Spartan means , '' Mr. McDonough says . </s>
<s> The fund 's lawyers work in an Athenian grove of potted trees . </s>
<s> Economists and administrators sit along a `` boulevard '' with street lamps and ficus trees . </s>
<s> In offices , triphosphorous bulbs simulate daylight . </s>
<s> Offices with outside windows have inside windows , too , to let in more real daylight . </s>
<s> `` We proved a healthy office does n't cost more , '' says Frederic Krupp , executive director of the fund . </s>
<s> It `` really looks beautiful and is very light , '' says Ann Hornaday , a free-lance writer who has visited the office for lunch meetings . </s>
<s> But , she says , `` I guess I did n't really notice the trees . </s>
<s> Maybe they were hidden by all the people . '' </s>
<s> Neither the Quilted Giraffe nor the Paul Stuart renovation reflects much of Mr. McDonough 's environmental concern . </s>
<s> The restaurant was conceived as a sparkling , crystalline `` geode . '' </s>
<s> It makes extensive use of stainless steel , silver and aluminum that sets off black granite table tops and a gray terrazzo with zinc-strip floors . </s>
<s> To more than replace the wood from two English oaks used for paneling at Paul Stuart , however , Mr. McDonough and friends planted 1,000 acorns around the country . </s>
<s> The ambitious Warsaw project still awaits approval by city officials . </s>
<s> Its developer is a Polish American , Sasha Muniak . </s>
<s> He had worked with Mr. McDonough on an earlier project and recruited him as architect for the trade center . </s>
<s> The center will provide space for computer hardware and facsimile and other telecommunications equipment , not readily accessible in Poland now , for a growing number of Westerners doing business in Eastern Europe . </s>
<s> Mr. McDonough thinks of the center as the `` Eiffel Tower of Warsaw '' and `` a symbol of the resurgence of Poland . '' </s>
<s> If any nation can use environmentally benign architecture , it is Poland . </s>
<s> Jessica Mathews , vice president of World Resources Institute in Washington , D.C. , says that perhaps a quarter of Poland 's soil is too contaminated for safe farming because of air pollution . </s>
<s> The pollution is also killing forests and destroying buildings that date back to the Middle Ages . </s>
<s> The future of the forest remains uncertain . </s>
<s> Mr. Muniak 's company , Balag Ltd. , has agreed to set aside the money to plant and maintain it , but discussions are still going on over where to place it and how to ensure that it will be maintained . </s>
<s> After all , Mr. Muniak says , `` in Poland there are n't too many people worried about the environment . </s>
<s> They 're more worried about bread on the table . </s>
