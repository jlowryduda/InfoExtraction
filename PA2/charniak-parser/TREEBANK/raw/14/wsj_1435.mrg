<s> In the hard-hit Marina neighborhood , life after the earthquake is often all too real , but sometimes surreal . </s>
<s> Some scenes : -- Saturday morning , a resident was given 15 minutes to scurry into a sagging building and reclaim what she could of her life 's possessions . </s>
<s> Saturday night she dined in an emergency shelter on salmon steaks prepared by chefs from one of the city 's four-star restaurants . </s>
<s> -- Mayor Art Agnos stands in the glare of television lights trying to explain for the 20th time why the city is severely restricting access to badly damaged structures . </s>
<s> A couple in fashionable spandex warm-up suits jogs by , headphones jauntily in place , weaving their way along a street of fractured and fallen houses . </s>
<s> At a nearby corner , they swerve perilously close to a listing apartment house , oblivious to any danger . </s>
<s> A policeman shakes his head in amazement as he steers them away . </s>
<s> -- A young woman who has been out of town shows up at the Marina Middle School to learn that her apartment is on the condemned list . </s>
<s> She is told she ca n't enter unless she is accompanied by an inspector . </s>
<s> She bursts into tears and walks away . </s>
<s> Nearby , five temporary residents of the school shelter sit on stools , having their necks and backs kneaded by volunteer masseuses . </s>
<s> The Marina rescue center offered a very San Franciscan response to the disaster . </s>
<s> In addition to free massages , there was free counseling , phone calls and a free shuttle bus to a health club , which offered up its showers , saunas and hot tubs . </s>
<s> The cafeteria offered donated croissants and brie for breakfast , and for dinner , pasta salad and chocolate mousse torts along with the salmon . </s>
<s> `` This has been a 15-pound earthquake for me , '' said resident Joan O'Shea , who works in an acupuncturist 's office . </s>
<s> She and some friends are considering offering earthquake victims free yoga classes and `` aroma therapy '' -- massages with scented oils . </s>
<s> She finds the response of Marina residents -- primarily yuppies and elderly people -- to the devastation of their homes `` incredible . </s>
<s> People have been very respectful of each other . </s>
<s> I do n't know if this would have happened somewhere else . '' </s>
<s> Out on the streets , some residents of badly damaged buildings were allowed a 15-minute scavenger hunt through their possessions . </s>
<s> `` It 's so weird to have to decide what 's really important to you , '' said Barbara May . </s>
<s> She went first for personal mementos . </s>
<s> In post-earthquake parlance , her building is a `` red . '' </s>
<s> After being inspected , buildings with substantial damage were color-coded . </s>
<s> Green allowed residents to re-enter ; yellow allowed limited access ; red allowed residents one last entry to gather everything they could within 15 minutes . </s>
<s> Reds and yellows went about their business with a kind of measured grimness . </s>
<s> Some frantically dumped belongings into pillowcases , others threw goods out windows . </s>
<s> It did n't help that on Saturday , after three days of sunshine , it rained . </s>
<s> `` The guys are going for their skis , their stereos , their personal computers , '' said Frank Fitzgerald , who helped others empty their apartments . </s>

<s> It belonged to her grandfather . </s>
<s> Some residents defied orders and returned to `` red '' buildings to retrieve goods . </s>
<s> One building was upgraded to red status while people were taking things out , and a resident who was n't allowed to go back inside called up the stairs to his girlfriend , telling her to keep sending things down to the lobby . </s>
<s> A policewoman had to be called in to make her leave ; the policewoman helped carry out one last load . </s>
<s> Enforcement of restricted-entry rules was sporadic , residents said . </s>
<s> One man trying to remove his car was told by officials to get out of his garage . </s>
<s> When he sneaked back later to try again , a different policeman offered to help him get the car out . </s>
<s> The Marina also has become the focal point of city efforts to reunite residents with any pets that may have fled or become lost during the earthquake . </s>
<s> On lampposts along Fillmore Street , a major Marina artery , posters were offering a $ 100 reward for a cat lost during the quake . </s>
<s> The San Francisco Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals also has been providing medical care , food , water and foster homes for quake-displaced animals . </s>
<s> The SPCA says it has received more than 100 requests for foster homes on behalf of dogs and cats , though some people have sought temporary homes for birds and fish . </s>
<s> For example , one parakeet owner returning home found that her apartment , like many others in the Marina , did n't have heat . </s>
<s> `` She can stay there with no heat , but for a parakeet , that can be deadly , '' says Daralee Konowitch , animalcare services manager for the SPCA . </s>
<s> A warm foster home has been found . </s>
