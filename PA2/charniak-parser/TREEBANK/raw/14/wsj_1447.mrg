<s> Philip Morris Cos. , whose Benson & Hedges cigarette brand has been losing market share , has asked at least one other agency to try its hand at creative work for the big account , which has been at Wells Rich Greene Inc. since 1966 . </s>
<s> Executives close to Philip Morris said that the tobacco and food giant has asked Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide Inc. , a unit of Saatchi & Saatchi Co. , and possibly others to work on creative ideas for the account . </s>
<s> Several executives said another potential contender is WPP Group 's Ogilvy & Mather agency , which works on some other Philip Morris products . </s>
<s> Both Philip Morris and Backer Spielvogel declined to comment . </s>
<s> A spokeswoman for Ogilvy & Mather said the agency does n't comment on `` idle speculation . '' </s>
<s> Also mentioned as a contender was TBWA Advertising , but the company denied it was participating . </s>
<s> The loss of the cigarette account would be a severe blow to Wells Rich . </s>
<s> Benson & Hedges has been one of its most high-visibility campaigns , as well as one of its largest clients . </s>
<s> The account billed almost $ 60 million last year , according to Leading National Advertisers . </s>
<s> But Philip Morris has scaled back ad spending on the brand over the past year , industry executives said , and it now bills about $ 30 million to $ 40 million . </s>
<s> Industry executives said Philip Morris had asked the other agencies to create campaigns in a bid to stop the brand 's slipping market share . </s>
<s> According to John Maxwell , an analyst at Wheat First Securities , Richmond , Va. , Benson & Hedges has slipped from 4.7 % of the cigarette market in 1985 to just 4.1 % after the second quarter of this year . </s>
<s> The brand is No. 7 overall in the cigarette business , Mr. Maxwell said . </s>
<s> The slip has come despite high-profile ads created by Wells Rich , including one picturing a young man clad only in pajama bottoms interrupting a festive brunch . </s>
<s> That ad generated so much publicity that a trade magazine launched a contest for its readers to guess who the guy was and what he was doing . </s>
<s> Wells Rich first popularized the Benson & Hedges brand more than 20 years ago with ads portraying , among other things , an elevator door closing on a passenger 's cigarette . </s>
<s> The brand early on achieved an upscale appeal -- a trait that some analysts believe is partly responsible for its staid performance . </s>
<s> Philip Morris , trying to revive the Benson & Hedges franchise , put the account up for review in 1986 . </s>
<s> Wells Rich Greene , however , in an effort directed by Mary Wells Lawrence , emerged the victor of the review and retained the business . </s>
<s> Kenneth Olshan , Wells Rich 's chairman , did n't return phone calls seeking comment . </s>
<s> While Wells Rich recently picked up Hertz Corp. 's $ 25 million to $ 30 million account , it has lost a number of big accounts this year , including the $ 20 million to $ 25 million Cadbury-Schweppes Canada Dry and Sunkist accounts , the $ 18 million Procter & Gamble Co . Sure deodorant account and the $ 10 million Polo\/Ralph Lauren business . </s>
<s> Its victories include more than $ 30 million in Sheraton Corp. business and an assignment from Dun & Bradstreet worth $ 5 million to $ 10 million . </s>
