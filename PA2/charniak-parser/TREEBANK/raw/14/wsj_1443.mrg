<s> Immunex Corp. said its scientists isolated a molecule which may hold potential as a treatment for disruptions of the immune-system , ranging from organ-transplant rejection , to allergies and asthma . </s>
<s> The molecule is the mouse version of a protein called the interleukin-4 receptor . </s>
<s> IL-4 is a hormone which directs the growth and function of white blood cells involved in the body 's immune response . </s>
<s> The IL-4 receptor on the surface of such cells receives the hormone 's message to rally the body 's defense . </s>
<s> But in certain conditions such as autoimmune diseases and allergies and transplant rejection , doctors would like to damp the immune response so such cells do n't touch off harmful inflammatory reactions or cell destruction . </s>
<s> A soluble form of the receptor might turn off a specific part of the immune response without general immune suppression , the company said . </s>
<s> The IL-4 receptor is one of five such receptors to be developed and tested by Receptech Corp. , a spinoff of Immunex , through a proposed $ 30 million initial public offering . </s>
<s> Immunex will contract with the spinoff to provide the research , development and initial testing of the new agents . </s>
<s> Immunex will have the option to buy back Receptech shares after five years . </s>
