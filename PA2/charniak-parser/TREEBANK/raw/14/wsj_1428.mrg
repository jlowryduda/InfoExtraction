<s> OPEC 's ability to produce more petroleum than it can sell is beginning to cast a shadow over world oil markets . </s>
<s> Output from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is already at a high for the year and most member nations are running flat out . </s>
<s> But industry and OPEC officials agree that a handful of members still have enough unused capacity to glut the market and cause an oil-price collapse a few months from now if OPEC does n't soon adopt a new quota system to corral its chronic cheaters . </s>
<s> As a result , the effort by some oil ministers to get OPEC to approve a new permanent production-sharing agreement next month is taking on increasing urgency . </s>
<s> The organization is scheduled to meet in Vienna beginning Nov. 25 . </s>
<s> So far this year , rising demand for OPEC oil and production restraint by some members have kept prices firm despite rampant cheating by others . </s>
<s> But that could change if demand for OPEC 's oil softens seasonally early next year as some think may happen . </s>
<s> OPEC is currently producing more than 22 million barrels a day , sharply above its nominal , self-imposed fourth-quarter ceiling of 20.5 million , according to OPEC and industry officials at an oil conference here sponsored by the Oil Daily and the International Herald Tribune . </s>
<s> At that rate , a majority of OPEC 's 13 members have reached their output limits , they said . </s>
<s> But it is estimated that at least three million barrels a day -- and possibly as much as seven million barrels a day -- of spare capacity still exists within OPEC . </s>
<s> Most is concentrated in five Persian Gulf countries , including his own , Issam Al-Chalabi , Iraq 's oil minister , told the conference Friday . </s>
<s> He puts OPEC 's current capacity at 28 million to 29 million barrels a day . </s>
<s> That 's higher than some other estimates . </s>
<s> Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah , Kuwait 's oil minister , recently estimated OPEC capacity at 25 million barrels a day . </s>
<s> Either way , the overhang is big enough to keep delicately balanced oil markets on edge . </s>
<s> Even modest amounts of additional output by those with the huge extra capacity and reserves , such as Saudi Arabia and Iraq , could upset the market . </s>
<s> The Iraqi oil minister and Saudi oil minister Hisham Nazer insisted in their comments to the conference that their countries would act responsibly to maintain a stable market . </s>
<s> However , in interviews later , both ministers stressed that they expect future OPEC quotas to be based mainly on the production capacity and reserves of each member . </s>
<s> Under that approach , countries with the most unused oil capacity would get bigger shares of any future increases in OPEC 's production ceiling than they would under the current system . </s>
<s> `` If you are already producing at 95 % or 100 % of your capacity , what 's the good to be told you can produce at 105 % of capacity ? '' asked Mr. Al-Chalabi . </s>
<s> At an inconclusive Geneva meeting late last month , OPEC 's oil ministers halfheartedly approved another increase of one million barrels a day in their production ceiling . </s>
<s> They doled it out using the existing formula , however , which meant that even those countries that could n't produce more received higher official allotments . </s>
<s> The main effect of the ceiling boost was to `` legitimize '' some of the overproduction already coming from the quota cheaters . </s>
<s> Still , there was a breakthrough at Geneva . </s>
<s> Previously , no OPEC member had been willing to accept a reduction in its percentage share of the group 's total output target , or ceiling . </s>
<s> But the concept of disproportionate quotas for those with unused capacity , advanced there in an Iranian proposal , was generally endorsed by the ministers . </s>
<s> In the end politics got in the way . </s>
<s> Libya accepted Iran 's proposal only so long as it was promised production parity with Kuwait . </s>
<s> And the United Arab Emirates , a chronic quota cheater , refused to give any guarantee it would change its ways . </s>
<s> But the oil ministers continue to study the plan , and it will probably be the basis for discussion at next month 's meeting . </s>
<s> It 's understood several compromises already have been worked into the plan . </s>
<s> The ceiling would be lifted to 21.5 million barrels to provide Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates much higher official quotas while reducing percentage shares of some others . </s>
<s> Libya 's previous conditions are no longer considered a problem , although the United Arab Emirates is still an issue . </s>
<s> Saudi Arabia , OPEC 's kingpin , also has surfaced as a possible obstacle , some OPEC sources said . </s>
<s> Insisting on a 24.5 % share of any ceiling , Saudi officials have long pressed for the pro rata distribution of increases to all members . </s>
<s> In Geneva , however , they supported Iran 's proposal because it would have left the Saudi percentage of the OPEC total intact , and increased actual Saudi volume to nearly 5.3 million barrels daily from five million . </s>
<s> Some of the proposed modifications since , however , call on Saudi Arabia to `` give back '' to the production-sharing pool a token 23,000 barrels . </s>
<s> Though tiny , that 's a reduction in its share . </s>
<s> Mr. Nazer , the Saudi oil minister , reiterated here that the kingdom would insist on maintaining its percentage share of OPEC production under any quota revisions . </s>
<s> `` Under any circumstances , Saudi Arabia should get more '' rather than less , Mr. Nazer said . </s>
