<s> After several years of booming business with China , foreign traders are bracing for the biggest slump in a decade . </s>
<s> The imposition of austerity measures , starting last October , already had begun to pinch when the massacre in Tiananmen Square on June 4 and subsequent events tugged the belt far tighter . </s>
<s> Foreign lending has been virtually suspended since then , choking liquidity and hobbling many projects . </s>
<s> And Beijing has pulled back on domestic loans and subsidies , leaving many domestic buyers and export-oriented plants strapped for cash . </s>
<s> Givaudan Far East Ltd. , a Swiss concern that sells chemicals to shampoo and soap factories in China , typifies the problems . </s>
<s> Last year 's retrenchment dried up the working capital of Chinese factories . </s>
<s> The company 's sales flattened during 1989 's first half . </s>
<s> The June killings magnified the problems . </s>
<s> In Canton , Givaudan 's representative office received no orders in June . </s>
<s> At first it attributed the slump to temporary business disruptions , but when no orders were logged in August and September , manager Donald Lai became convinced that business would be bad for many months . </s>
<s> `` Things have grown worse since June 4 , '' Mr. Lai says . </s>
<s> He predicts that sales will drop between 30 % and 40 % from last year 's $ 3 million . </s>
<s> The consumer-products and light-industrial sectors are bearing the brunt of China 's austerity measures , and foreign companies such as Givaudan that deal with those industries are being hit the hardest . </s>
<s> But in general , all foreign-trading companies are feeling the pinch . </s>
<s> `` The import pie will shrink , '' says John Kamm , first vice president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and a China trade specialist . </s>
<s> `` On the down side , sales could fall as much as 90 % for some companies ; on the upper side , sales will be flat . '' </s>
<s> China 's foreign trade has gone in cycles during the past decade . </s>
<s> The last time that traders experienced a trough was during 1985-86 , when Beijing imposed tough measures to curb imports and conserve foreign exchange . </s>
<s> The current trough is expected to be much deeper , because Beijing has cut off domestic funds from factories for the first time to slow inflation . </s>
<s> In addition , the suspension of loans and export credits from foreign governments and institutions following the June killings have been a big setback . </s>
<s> `` The freeze on new lending is dealing the single biggest blow to trading , '' says Raymond Wong , China manager for Mannesmann AG , a West German machinery-trading company . </s>
<s> Import growth from the year-earlier months slowed to 16 % in July and 7.1 % in August , compared with an average growth rate of 26 % in the first half . </s>
<s> In the first eight months of 1989 , imports grew 21 % , to $ 38.32 billion , down slightly from a growth rate of 23 % a year earlier . </s>
<s> The picture for China 's exports is just as bleak , mainly because of the domestic credit squeeze . </s>
<s> Exports in the first eight months grew only 9 % , to $ 31.48 billion , compared with a growth rate of 25 % a year earlier , according to Chinese customs figures . </s>
<s> The threat to China 's balance of payments is further aggravated by the plunge in its foreign-exchange reserves , excluding gold holdings . </s>
<s> The reserves dropped for the first time in recent years , to $ 14 billion in June from $ 19 billion in April . </s>
<s> The trend has prompted Beijing to intensify efforts to curb imports . </s>
<s> In recent weeks , China 's leaders have recentralized trading in wool and scores of chemical products and commodities . </s>
<s> The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade set up a special bureau last month to monitor the issue of import and export licenses . </s>
<s> Beijing 's periodic clampdowns on imports have taught many trading companies that the best way to get through the drought is by helping China export . </s>
<s> For example , Nissho Iwai Corp. , one of the biggest Japanese trading houses , now buys almost twice as many goods from China as it sells to that country . </s>
<s> Three years ago , the ratio was reversed . </s>
<s> But the strategy is n't helping much this time . </s>
<s> `` Both sectors of imports and exports look just as bad , '' says Masahiko Kitamura , general manager of Nissho Iwai 's Canton office . </s>
<s> He expects the company 's trading business to drop as much as 40 % this year . </s>
<s> For a short time after June 4 , it appeared that the trade picture would remain fairly bright . </s>
<s> Many foreign trading offices in Hong Kong were swamped with telexes and telephone calls from Chinese trade officials urging them not to sever ties . </s>
<s> Even the Bank of China , which normally took weeks to process letters of credit , was settling the letters at record speed to dispel rumors about the bank 's financial health . </s>
<s> But when foreign traders tried to do business , they discovered that the eagerness of Chinese trade officials was just a smokescreen . </s>
<s> The suspension of foreign loans has weakened the buying power of China 's national trading companies , which are among the country 's biggest importers . </s>
<s> Business is n't any better on the provincial or municipal level , foreign traders say . </s>
<s> Shanghai Investment & Trust Co. , known as Sitco , is the city 's main financier for trading business . </s>
<s> Sitco had customarily tapped the Japanese bond market for funds , but it ca n't do that any longer . </s>
<s> Foreign traders say the company is strapped for cash . </s>
<s> `` It has difficulties paying its foreign debts , '' says a Hong Kong executive who is familiar with Sitco 's business . </s>
<s> `` How can it make available funds for purchases ? '' </s>
<s> Foreign traders also say many of China 's big infrastructural projects have been canceled or postponed because of the squeeze on domestic and foreign credit . </s>
<s> Albert Lee , a veteran trader who specializes in machinery sales , estimates that as many as 70 % of projects that had obtained approval to proceed have been canceled in recent months . </s>
<s> `` There are virtually no new projects , and that means no new business for us , '' he says . </s>
<s> Even when new lending resumes , foreign exchange would still be tight because Beijing will likely try to rein in foreign borrowing , which has grown between 30 % and 40 % in the past few years . </s>
<s> And foreign creditors are likely to be more cautious about extending new loans because China is nearing a peak repayment period as many loans start falling due in the next two to five years . </s>
<s> Another reason for the intensity of the trade problems is that Beijing has extended the current clampdown on imports beyond the usual target of consumer products to include steel , chemical fertilizers and plastics . </s>
<s> These have been among the country 's leading imports , particularly last year when there were shortages that led many traders to buy heavily and pay dearly . </s>
<s> But the shortages also spawned rampant speculation and spiraling prices . </s>
<s> To stem speculation , Beijing imposed ceiling prices that went into effect earlier this year . </s>
<s> Traders who had bought the goods at prices above the ceiling do n't want to take a loss on resales and are holding onto their stock . </s>
<s> The resulting stockpiling has depressed the market . </s>
<s> But Beijing ca n't cut back on such essential imports as raw materials for too long without hampering the country 's export business . </s>
<s> Mr. Kamm , the China trade expert , estimates that as much as 50 % of Guangdong 's exports is made up of processed imported raw materials . </s>
