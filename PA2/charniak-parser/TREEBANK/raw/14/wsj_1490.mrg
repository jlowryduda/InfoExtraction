<s> The collapse of a $ 6.79 billion buy-out of United Airlines parent UAL Corp. has handed Wall Street 's takeover stock speculators their worst loss ever on a single deal . </s>
<s> Their $ 700 million-plus in estimated paper losses easily tops the $ 400 million in paper losses the takeover traders , known as arbitragers , suffered in 1982 when Gulf Oil Co. dropped a $ 4.8 billion offer for Cities Service Co . </s>
<s> In the six trading days since the UAL labor-management buy-out group failed to get bank financing , culminating Friday with the withdrawal of its partner British Airways PLC , UAL stock has plummeted by 41 % to 168 1\/2 from 285 1\/4 . </s>
<s> The arbs may recoup some of their paper losses if the UAL deal gets patched up again , as they did in 1982 when Occidental Petroleum Co. rescued them with a $ 4 billion takeover of Cities Service . </s>
<s> In the meantime , the question faced by investors is : What is UAL stock worth ? </s>
<s> The short answer , on a fundamental basis , is that airline analysts say the stock is worth somewhere between $ 135 and $ 150 a share . </s>
<s> That 's based on a multiple of anywhere between 8.5 to 10 times UAL earnings , which are estimated to come in somewhere around $ 16 a share this year . </s>
<s> Airline stocks typically sell at a discount of about one-third to the stock market 's price-earnings ratio -- which is currently about 13 times earnings . </s>
<s> That 's because airline earnings , like those of auto makers , have been subject to the cyclical ups-and-downs of the economy . </s>
<s> That analysis matches up with stock traders ' reports that , despite the huge drop in the stock , UAL has n't returned to the level at which it could attract buying by institutions solely on the basis of earnings . </s>
<s> So anyone buying the stock now is betting on some special transaction such as a recapitalization or takeover , and must do so using some guesswork about the likelihood of such an event . </s>
<s> One analyst , who asked not to be identified , said he believes that the UAL pilots and management can put together a bid `` in the $ 225 area , '' but that it could take three to four months to close . </s>
<s> At that level , and given the uncertainty , he believes UAL stock should trade closer to </s>
<s> Other observers note that UAL 's board , having accepted a bid of $ 300 a share , might hold out for a new bid much closer to the original level -- even if it means that the management goes back to running the company for a while and lets things return to normal . </s>
<s> By that logic , the closing of a deal could be much further away than three to four months , even though the eventual price might be higher . </s>
<s> Investment bankers following UAL agree that the strongest impetus for an eventual deal is that the pilots have been attempting a buy-out for more than two years , and are n't likely to stop , having come so close to success . </s>
<s> The pilots have a strong financing tool in their willingness to cut their annual compensation by $ 200 million , and to commit $ 200 million from their retirement funds . </s>
<s> On Friday , they also persuaded the UAL flight attendants to join them . </s>
<s> However , investment bankers say that banks are n't likely to lend the almost $ 5 billion that would be necessary for a takeover even at a lower price without someone putting up a hefty wad of cash -- probably even greater than the 17 % in cash put up by investors in the leveraged takeover of Northwest Airlines parent NWA Corp. in July . </s>
<s> Banks want to see someone putting up real cash at risk , that is , subordinate to the bank debt in any deal . </s>
<s> That way , they figure , someone else has an even stronger motivation to make sure the deal is going to work , because they would be losing their money before the banks lost theirs . </s>
<s> Banks also want to be able to call someone on the telephone to fix a problem with a deal that goes bad -- preferably someone other than a union leader . </s>
<s> That leaves the pilots still in need of cash totaling around $ 1 billion -- far more than either they or the flight attendants can lay their hands on from retirement funds alone . </s>
<s> One obstacle to the pilots ' finding such a huge amount of cash is their insistence on majority ownership . </s>
<s> Investors such as Marvin Davis of Los Angeles who have sought airline ownership this year have insisted they , not the pilots , must have control . </s>
<s> One way out of that dilemma could be a partial recapitalization in which the pilots would wind up sharing the value of their concessions with public shareholders . </s>
<s> The pilots could borrow against the value of their concessions , using the proceeds to buy back stock from the public and give themselves the majority control they have been seeking . </s>
<s> But it is n't clear that banks would lend sufficient money to deliver a big enough price to shareholders . </s>
<s> The lack of any new cash probably would still leave the banks dissatisfied . </s>
<s> In advising the UAL board on the various bids for the airline , starting with one for $ 240 a share from Mr. Davis , the investment bank of First Boston came up with a wide range of potential values for the company , depending on appraisal methods and assumptions . </s>
<s> Using the the NWA takeover as a benchmark , First Boston on Sept. 14 estimated that UAL was worth $ 250 to $ 344 a share based on UAL 's results for the 12 months ending last June 30 , but only $ 235 to $ 266 based on a management estimate of results for 1989 . </s>
<s> First Boston 's estimates had been higher before management supplied a 1989 projection . </s>
<s> Using estimates of the company 's future earnings under a variety of scenarios , First Boston estimated UAL 's value at $ 248 to $ 287 a share if its future labor costs conform to Wall Street projections ; $ 237 to $ 275 if the company reaches a settlement with pilots similar to one at NWA ; $ 98 to $ 121 under an adverse labor settlement , and $ 229 to $ 270 under a pilot contract imposed by the company following a strike . </s>
<s> And using liquidation value assuming the sale of all UAL assets , First Boston estimated the airline is worth $ 253 to $ 303 a share . </s>
<s> Unfortunately , all those estimates came before airline industry fundamentals deteriorated during the past month . </s>
<s> American Airlines parent AMR and USAir Group , both subject to takeover efforts themselves , have each warned of declining results . </s>
<s> Some analysts do n't expect a quick revival of any takeover by the pilots . </s>
<s> The deal has , as one takeover expert puts it , `` so many moving parts . </s>
<s> I do n't see anybody who 's sophisticated getting his name associated with this mess until the moving parts stop moving . '' </s>
<s> In addition to the need for another cash equity investor , the other moving parts include : the pilots themselves , who can scuttle rival deals by threatening to strike ; the machinists union , the pilots ' longtime rivals who helped scuttle the pilots ' deal ; and regulators in Washington , whose opposition to foreign airline investment helped throw the deal into doubt . </s>
<s> In the meantime , the arbs are bleeding . </s>
<s> Wall Street traders and analysts estimate that takeover stock traders own UAL stock and options equal to as many as 6.5 million shares , or about 30 % of the total outstanding . </s>
<s> Frank Gallagher , an analyst with Phoenix Capital Corp. in New York , estimates that the arbs paid an average of about $ 280 a share for their UAL positions . </s>
<s> That would indicate that the arbs have paper losses on UAL alone totalling $ 725 million . </s>
