<s> This city is girding for gridlock today as hundreds of thousands of commuters avoid travel routes ravaged by last week 's earthquake . </s>
<s> Estimates of damage in the six-county San Francisco Bay area neared $ 5 billion , excluding the cost of repairing the region 's transportation system . </s>
<s> The Bay Bridge , the main artery into San Francisco from the east , will be closed for at least several weeks . </s>
<s> Part of the bridge collapsed in the quake , which registered 6.9 on the Richter scale . </s>
<s> The bridge normally carries 250,000 commuters a day . </s>
<s> Also , most of the ramps connecting the city to its main link to the south , the 101 freeway , have been closed for repairs . </s>
<s> The Bay Area Rapid Transit system , which runs subway trains beneath the bay , is braced for a doubling of its daily regular ridership to 300,000 . </s>
<s> BART has increased service to 24 hours a day in preparation for the onslaught . </s>
<s> Most unusual will be water-borne commuters from the East Bay towns of Oakland and Berkeley . </s>
<s> For the first time in 32 years , ferry service has been restored between the East Bay and San Francisco . </s>
<s> The Red and White Fleet , which operates regular commuter ferry service to and from Marin County , and tourist tours of the bay , is offering East Bay commuters a chance to ride the waves for the price of $ 10 round-trip . </s>
<s> That tariff is too stiff for some Financial District wage earners . </s>
<s> `` I 'll stay with BART , '' said one secretary , swallowing her fears about using the transbay tube . </s>
<s> Officials expect the Golden Gate Bridge to be swamped with an extra load of commuters , including East Bay residents making a long detour . </s>
<s> `` We 're anticipating quite a traffic crunch , '' said one official . </s>
<s> About 23,000 people typically travel over the Golden Gate Bridge during commute hours . </s>
<s> About 130,000 vehicles cross during a 24-hour period . </s>
<s> Meetings canceled by Apple Computer Inc. 's European sales force and by other groups raised the specter of empty hotel rooms and restaurants . </s>
<s> It also raised hackles of the city 's tourism boosters . </s>
<s> `` Other cities are calling -LCB- groups booked here for tours and conferences -RCB- and -- not to be crass -- stealing our booking list , '' said Scott Shafer , a spokesman for Mayor Art Agnos . </s>
<s> City officials stuck by their estimate of $ 2 billion in damage to the quake-shocked city . </s>
<s> The other five Bay area counties have increased their total damage estimates to $ 2.8 billion . </s>
<s> All estimates exclude highway repair , which could exceed $ 1 billion . </s>
<s> Among the expensive unknowns are stretches of elevated freeway in San Francisco that were closed because of quake-inflicted damage . </s>
<s> The most worrisome stretch is 1.2 miles of waterfront highway known as the Embarcadero Freeway . </s>
<s> Until it was closed Tuesday , it had provided the quickest series of exits for commuters from the Bay Bridge heading into the Financial District . </s>
<s> Engineers say it will take at least eight months to repair the Embarcadero structure . </s>
<s> As part of the quake recovery effort , the city Building Department has surveyed about 3,000 buildings , including all of the Financial District 's high-rises . </s>
<s> The preliminary conclusion from a survey of 200 downtown high-rises is that `` we were incredibly lucky , '' said Lawrence Kornfield , San Francisco 's chief building inspector . </s>
<s> While many of these buildings sustained heavy damage , little of that involved major structural damage . </s>
<s> City building codes require construction that can resist temblors . </s>
<s> In England , Martin Leach , a spokesman for Lloyd 's of London , said the insurance market has n't yet been able to estimate the total potential claims from the disaster . </s>
<s> `` The extent of the claims wo n't be known for some time , '' Mr. Leach said . </s>
<s> On Friday , during a visit to California to survey quake damage , President Bush promised to `` meet the federal government 's obligation '' to assist relief efforts . </s>
<s> California officials plan to ask Congress for $ 3 billion or more of federal aid , in the form of grants and low-interest loans . </s>
<s> The state has a $ 1 billion reserve , and is expected to add $ 1 billion to that fund in the next year . </s>
<s> Some of that money will be available for highway repair and special emergency aid , but members of the legislature are also mulling over a temporary state gasoline tax to raise money for earthquake relief . </s>
<s> However , state initiatives restrict the ability of the legislature to raise such taxes unless the voters approve in a statewide referendum . </s>
