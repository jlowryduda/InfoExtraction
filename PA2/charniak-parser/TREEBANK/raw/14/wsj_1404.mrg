<s> Groupe AG 's chairman said the Belgian insurer is prepared to give up some of its independence to a white knight if necessary to repel a raider . </s>
<s> Amid heavy buying of shares in Belgium 's largest insurer , Maurice Lippens also warned in an interview that a white knight , in buying out a raider , could leave speculators with big losses on their AG stock . </s>
<s> Since the beginning of the year , the stock has nearly doubled , giving AG a market value of about 105 billion Belgian francs -LRB- $ 2.7 billion -RRB- . </s>
<s> The most likely white knight would be Societe Generale de Belgique S.A. , which already owns 18 % of AG and which itself is controlled by Cie . Financiere de Suez , the acquisitive French financial conglomerate . </s>
<s> But Mr. Lippens said a rescue also could involve Asahi Mutual Life Insurance Co. , which owns 5 % of AG . </s>
<s> AG is hardly alone in its anxiety . </s>
<s> A rambunctious shake-up is quickly reshaping Europe 's once-stately insurance business . </s>
<s> Worried by European Community directives that will remove many of the barriers to cross-border insurance services , starting in mid-1990 , insurers are rushing to find partners and preparing for price wars . </s>
<s> In West Germany and the Netherlands , insurers are flirting with banks . </s>
<s> In France , Suez and Axa-Midi Assurances S.A. both have been on the prowl for giant acquisitions ; Suez last month acquired control of Groupe Victoire , the sixth-largest European insurance company , after a takeover battle with Cie . Industrielle . </s>
<s> Mr. Lippens said the volume of shares changing hands has grown significantly since mid-September . </s>
<s> But he estimated that a raider would have been able to amass no more than 4 % of the shares in recent months . </s>
<s> Aside from exploring plans for joint ventures or acquisitions , Mr. Lippens has called top managers of companies rumored as potential raiders -- among them , Axa-Midi , Union des Assurances de Paris and Suez , all based in France . </s>
<s> They have all `` very clearly stated that they have not acquired and are not acquiring shares of AG , '' he said . </s>
<s> Any raider would find it hard to crack AG 's battlements . </s>
<s> A `` syndicate '' of shareholders holds just under 50 % of AG , Mr. Lippens said , and members have agreed to give one another the right of first refusal should they sell any AG shares . </s>
<s> Aside from Generale de Belgique and Asahi , the syndicate includes Antwerpsche Hypotheekkas , a Belgian savings bank , and various family interests . </s>
<s> A Generale spokesman confirmed that the giant Belgian holding company would be willing to raise its stake in AG should a raider seek control . </s>
<s> Asahi officials could n't be reached for comment . </s>
<s> Even without bid talk , this year 's surge in prices for Brussels real estate has excited interest in AG . </s>
<s> The company says those holdings constitute the third-biggest real-estate portfolio in Belgium . </s>
