<s> Qintex Australia Ltd. encountered another setback Friday when its Los Angeles-based affiliate , Qintex Entertainment Inc. , filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code . </s>
<s> Qintex Entertainment also said David Evans , its president and chief executive , and Roger Kimmel , a director , both resigned . </s>
<s> Neither could be reached for comment . </s>
<s> Earlier this month , Qintex Australia 's $ 1.5 billion agreement to acquire MGM\/UA Communications Co. collapsed because of a dispute over a $ 50 million letter of credit the Australian operator of television stations and resorts was to have supplied as security in the transaction . </s>
<s> Mr. Evans had been the de facto head of MGM\/UA for months . </s>
<s> Qintex Entertainment , a producer and distributor of television programs most noted for its co-production of the hit miniseries `` Lonesome Dove , '' said it filed for Chapter 11 protection after Qintex Australia failed to provide it with $ 5.9 million owed to MCA Inc. in connection with the distribution of `` The New Leave It to Beaver Show . '' </s>
<s> Qintex Entertainment is 43 % owned by Qintex Australia and said it relies on the Australian company for funding its working capital requirements . </s>
<s> After the announcement of the bankruptcy filing , Qintex Entertainment stock sank $ 2.625 in over-the-counter trading to close at $ 1.50 on heavy volume of more than 1.4 million shares . </s>
<s> The stock traded as high as $ 10 this past summer . </s>
<s> Jonathan Lloyd , executive vice president and chief financial officer of Qintex Entertainment , said Qintex Entertainment was forced to file for protection to avoid going into default under its agreement with MCA . </s>
<s> The $ 5.9 million payment was due Oct. 1 and the deadline for default was Oct. 19 . </s>
<s> Mr. Lloyd said if Qintex had defaulted it could have been required to repay $ 92 million in debt under its loan agreements . </s>
<s> MCA on Friday said that as a result of Qintex 's failure to make the required payment it was terminating the distribution agreement on `` The New Leave It to Beaver '' as well as other MCA properties . </s>
<s> Qintex Australia was `` saying as recently as last weekend that they would take care of the situation . </s>
<s> They continued to represent that to the board , '' said Mr. Lloyd . </s>
<s> `` We were reassured they would stand behind the company . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Lloyd said both Qintex Entertainment and Qintex Australia had attempted to secure a loan that would allow the company to make the $ 5.9 million payment but the request was turned down by an unidentified lender on Oct. 14 . </s>
<s> At that point , he said , Qintex Australia stated it would `` endeavor to arrange '' the financing . </s>
<s> However a Qintex Australia spokesman said his firm had never `` promised or guaranteed '' to make the payment . </s>
<s> In a prepared statement from Australia , the company also said that , following the breakdown of the MGM talks , it `` had been re-evaluating its position as a significant shareholder and a substantial creditor of Qintex Entertainment '' and had `` resolved to minimize the degree of further loans to Qintex Entertainment in excess of that previously made . '' </s>
<s> The Qintex Australia spokesman added that his company had opposed the Chapter 11 filing . </s>
<s> He said the company believed Qintex Entertainment 's financial problems could have been resolved by other means . </s>
<s> The report of the bankruptcy filing stunned Hollywood executives and investors . </s>
<s> `` It 's a shocker , '' said Joseph Di Lillo , chairman of Drake Capital Securities , a brokerage firm that has an investment in Qintex Entertainment . </s>
<s> Qintex Australia was `` going to pay more than $ 1 billion for MGM\/UA and then they could n't come up with the far smaller sum of $ 5.9 million . '' </s>
<s> Qintex said Mr. Evans , the former president , resigned for `` personal reasons '' and that Mr. Kimmel , an attorney , resigned because his participation in evaluating the company 's role in buying MGM\/UA was no longer necessary . </s>
<s> Mr. Kimmel was a director of the company and a predecessor firm since 1980 . </s>
<s> The announcement seemed to further damp prospects that talks between Qintex Australia and MGM\/UA might be revived . </s>
<s> It 's understood that MGM\/UA recently contacted Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp. , which made two failed bids for the movie studio , to see if the company was still interested . </s>
<s> However , `` we are n't currently doing anything . </s>
<s> It is n't a current topic of conversation at the company , '' said Barry Diller , chairman and chief executive officer of the Fox Inc. unit of News Corp . </s>
