<s> Banks are continuing to go after individual investors , despite falling interest rates . </s>
<s> Yields on small-denomination certificates of deposit fell at about half the rate of so-called jumbo CDs this week , according to Banxquote Money Markets , an information service based here . </s>
<s> Investors can get slightly higher yields on deposits below $ 50,000 than they can on deposits of $ 90,000 and up . </s>
<s> `` Banks want to remain competitive , '' said Norberto Mehl , chairman of Banxquote . </s>
<s> `` October is a big rollover month and perhaps they anticipate greater demand ... among people leaving the stock market . '' </s>
<s> Some bankers are reporting more inquiries than usual about CDs since Friday . </s>
<s> `` Reports from branches are that there has been greater interest in the last day or so , '' said Steven Braitman , a vice president at Chemical Bank in New York . </s>
<s> Chemical said deposits Monday were about $ 5 million higher than usual and it expects more activity as investors receive the proceeds from sales of stock . </s>
<s> `` This is no time to be playing in the street ... </s>
<s> the Dow has more ups and downs than an elevator , '' proclaimed an advertisement Monday in New York newspapers , touting Lincoln Savings Bank 's one-year CD . </s>
<s> Harold Jones , Lincoln 's chief retail banking officer , said there has n't yet been `` a discernible response , '' although the ad included a coupon that could arrive later in the week . </s>
<s> Friday 's market rout came smack in the middle of the heaviest month for CD rollovers , when a number of banks and thrifts already have promotions under way . </s>
<s> First National Bank of Boston , for example , is offering certain new depositors an extra quarter of a percentage point on six-month and 12-month CDs . </s>
<s> Some banks actually boosted yields on the shortest term CDs in the latest week . </s>
<s> New York 's Citibank , for instance , increased the yield on small-denomination three-month CDs to 8 % from 7.9 % . </s>
<s> On average , however , three-month CDs at major banks are yielding a tenth of a percentage point less than they were a week ago . </s>
<s> Average yields on CDs aimed at individual investors fell less than half as much as yields on Treasury bills sold at Monday 's auction . </s>
<s> Six-month CDs of $ 50,000 and less yielded an average 8.02 % in the week ended Tuesday , down from 8.10 % , according to Banxquote . </s>
<s> The yield on six-month T-bills fell to 7.82 % on Monday , from 8.01 % the week before . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , the average yield on six-month CDs of more than $ 90,000 fell to 7.93 % in the latest week , according to Banxquote , from 8.10 % the week before . </s>
<s> Mr. Mehl noted that actual rates are almost identical on small and large-denomination CDs , but yields on CDs aimed at the individual investor are boosted by more frequent compounding . </s>
<s> CDs sold by major brokerage houses , which like jumbo CDs tend to closely follow interest rate trends , also posted larger drops in yields . </s>
<s> A six-month , broker-sold CD , for example , was yielding an average 8.09 % in the latest week , a fifth of a percentage point lower than the week before . </s>
<s> In late April , when interest rates were at their recent highs , short-term CDs sold by brokers were offering yields half a percentage point or more higher than banks . </s>
<s> CD yields are generally expected to fall further in coming weeks . </s>
<s> `` What happened in the stock market and the bigger trade deficit '' reported yesterday `` make it unlikely that short-term interest rates will rise '' any time soon , said Mr. Mehl of Banxquote . </s>
<s> `` Even before the market drop , rates were down about half a percentage point , '' said Robert J. Hutchinson , senior vice president for retail marketing at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in New York . </s>
<s> `` That puts pressure on CD rates . </s>
