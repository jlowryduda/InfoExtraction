<s> Kay Peterson mounts her bicycle and grinds up yet another steep , rocky path seemingly suitable only for mountain goats . </s>
<s> After a tortuous climb , she is rewarded by a picture-postcard vista : a glade of golden aspens under an azure Indian-summer sky . </s>
<s> This place is 12 miles into the back country -- a day-long trudge for a hiker , but reached by Ms. Peterson and six others in a mere two hours of pedaling fat-tired mountain bikes . </s>
<s> `` This , '' says Ms. Peterson , `` is what it 's all about . '' </s>
<s> Twelve hundred miles away , rangers at a Napa County , Calif. , state park are among the many who do n't quite share the enthusiasm . </s>
<s> This summer , speeding bikers were blamed for an accident in the Napa County park , in which a horse -- spooked on a trail that was closed to bikers -- broke its leg . </s>
<s> The animal had to be destroyed ; the bikers fled and were never found . </s>
<s> In numerous parks near San Francisco , rangers have been forced to close trails , set up speed traps and use radar guns to curb fast and reckless riding . </s>
<s> They have even sent helicopters in pursuit of bikers after hikers and equestrians complained they were being driven from trails . </s>
<s> `` We were being overrun , '' says Steve Fiala , trails coordinator of the East Bay Regional Park District . </s>
<s> Two years ago , the district decided to limit the bikes to fire roads in its 65,000 hilly acres . </s>
<s> From about 200,000 six years ago , the number of mountain bikes in the U.S. is expected to grow to 10 million in 1990 . </s>
<s> At least half that growth will have come in the past three years alone . </s>
<s> The controversy kicked up by the proliferation of these all-terrain bicycles is one of the most divisive storms to blow through the national conservation movement in recent memory . </s>
<s> Bikers -- many of them ardent environmentalists -- proclaim their sport an efficient , safe , fitness-promoting way to get back to nature , while asserting a right , as taxpayers , to pedal on public lands . </s>
<s> But the bikes ' burgeoning numbers , safety concerns and fear that they damage fragile landscapes have prompted pleas , from the Sierras to the Eastern Seaboard , to ban them from the back country . </s>
<s> Key to the issue is that the bikes , in skillful hands , can go virtually anywhere , and in reckless hands can become vehicles of terror . </s>
<s> An adept bicyclist can leap from a dead stop to the top of a picnic table without losing balance . </s>
<s> Such skills allow riders to fly down treacherous mountain grades at speeds of up to 40 miles an hour -- a thrill for the cyclist but a nightmare for unsuspecting hikers or equestrians . </s>
<s> For harried public-land managers across the nation , the response is increasingly to shut the gates . </s>
<s> The state of California , following the lead of some regional parks , recently adopted regulations that closed nearly all hiking paths in state parks to mountain bicycles . </s>
<s> The move largely consigns them to roads used by motorized vehicles . </s>
<s> Most other states have enacted similar bans . </s>
<s> The bikes are unwelcome on trails in national parks . </s>
<s> Even the U.S. Forest Service , whose lenient `` multiple-use '' philosophy permits motorized vehicles on thousands of miles of its trails across the U.S. , has begun to close some lands to the bikes , including major portions of the popular Pacific Crest Trail , which stretches from California to Canada . </s>
<s> Often these closings come after vigorous anti-bike lobbying by conservation organizations , the politically potent Sierra Club among them . </s>
<s> Sierra has been instrumental in securing a number of the California bans . </s>
<s> It has been waging an all-out campaign to beat back a proposal , pushed by Utah bike groups , to allow the cycles in federally designated wilderness areas , where they are now prohibited . </s>
<s> Yet Sierra 's hard-line stance has created something of a rift in the organization , which estimates that 17 % of its 500,000 members own mountain bikes . </s>
<s> Pressure from these members prompted the club recently to soften its anti-bike rhetoric ; it no longer , for example , lumps the bikes into the same category as motorcycles and other terrain-marring off-road vehicles . </s>
<s> But the club still insists that public lands ought to be closed to the bikes unless studies indicate the bikes wo n't injure the environment or other users . </s>
<s> `` I have a mountain bike , yet as a hiker I 've been run off the road by kids careening down a fire trail on them , '' says Gene Coan , an official at Sierra 's headquarters in San Francisco , echoing the concerns of many members . </s>
<s> `` People who feel that cyclists should be banned from an area are n't looking at the whole picture , '' complains Mark Langton , associate editor of Mountain and City Biking magazine in Canoga Park , Calif . </s>
<s> Mr. Langton is among the legions of bikers who got their first taste of wilderness as hikers or backpackers . </s>
<s> He says fellow bikers show the same concern for the land that they demonstrated as hikers ; many are appalled that the conservation community would suddenly consider them the enemy . </s>
<s> To fight back , activists such as Mr. Langton are forming groups to lobby land managers over access issues and undertake education programs to show that the bikes can responsibly share trails . </s>
<s> Mr. Langton 's group , Concerned Off-Road Bicyclists Association , mounted petition drives to help keep open certain Santa Monica Mountain trails designated for closing . </s>
<s> Biking groups in Montana , Idaho , Michigan and Massachusetts have won similar concessions , says Tim Blumenthal , mountain bike editor of Bicycling magazine . </s>
<s> These groups have been trying to improve the mountain biker 's image ; in the San Francisco-area park district where a ranger was clobbered by a cyclist this summer bikers have formed a volunteer patrol to help rangers enforce regulations , and to school riders in proper trail etiquette . </s>
<s> Even staunch anti-bike Sierra members concede that 10 % of all riders cause most of the problems . </s>
<s> While some are renegade riders who simply scorn regulations , much bad riding simply reflects ignorance that can be corrected through `` education and peer pressure , '' says Jim Hasenauer , a director of the International Mountain Biking Association . </s>
<s> `` I think we 're making progress . '' </s>
<s> Few would have foreseen such a furor when , a decade ago , some Marin County bicycle enthusiasts created a hybrid bike using fat tires , lightweight metallurgy and multi-gear technology . </s>
<s> They wanted a machine that would allow them to pedal into rugged terrain then inaccessible to cycles . </s>
<s> They got a machine more responsive , more stable and in many ways easier to ride than the thin-tired racing bikes that then were the rage . </s>
<s> When the bikes first entered mass production in 1981 , they were dismissed as a fad . </s>
<s> Last year , 25 % of the 10 million bicycles sold in the U.S. were mountain bikes . </s>
<s> In California , a bellwether market , they accounted for more than 80 % of all bike sales . </s>
<s> The majority of the bikes never even make it into the high country . </s>
<s> City dwellers love them because they shift smoothly in traffic , bounce easily over curbs and roll through road glass with far fewer flat tires than racing bikes . </s>
<s> Crested Butte , population 1,200 , is a bastion of the sport . </s>
<s> By one estimate , everyone here under 50 owns at least one bike . </s>
<s> The town is home to the Mountain Bike Hall of Fame and it hosts the annual Fat Tire Bike Week . </s>
<s> This summer , the jamboree attracted more visitors than the busiest week of the town 's winter ski season . </s>
<s> David Lindsey , chairman of the Fat Tire Bike celebration , muses that the bike 's popularity may be a combination of technology and nostalgia . </s>
<s> `` The mountain bike feels as comfortable as the ` paperboy ' bike you had as a kid , but it can do so much more , '' he says . </s>
