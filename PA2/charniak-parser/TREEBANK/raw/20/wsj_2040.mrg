<s> Bankers Trust New York Corp. became the latest major U.S. bank to increase reserves for its loans to less-developed countries , making a $ 1.6 billion third-quarter addition to its provision . </s>
<s> The bank also said it expects to report a $ 1.42 billion loss for the third quarter and a loss for the full year . </s>
<s> The new reserves bring the company 's provision for loans to Third World countries to $ 2.6 billion , or 85 % of Bankers Trust 's medium and long-term loans to these countries . </s>
<s> `` Step up to the plate and take the big swing . </s>
<s> Get the problem behind you and do n't look back , '' said James J. McDermott , analyst at Keefe , Bruyette & Woods , in approving of the move . </s>
<s> Bankers Trust `` has had the capacity to do this for some time , '' the analyst said . </s>
<s> He expects Citicorp to take a similar step this year . </s>
<s> Citicorp yesterday reported a 9 % third-quarter earnings drop , which analysts called a bit disappointing , while Manufacturers Hanover Corp. posted a $ 789 million loss for the quarter after adding $ 950 million to its reserve for loans to less-developed countries . </s>
<s> Three other major U.S. banks posted earnings increases . </s>
<s> Wells Fargo & Co. of San Francisco posted a 17 % jump . </s>
<s> PNC Financial Corp. , the parent of Pittsburgh National Bank , reported net income climbed 9.8 % , while net for Banc One Corp. of Columbus , Ohio , grew 3.8 % . </s>
<s> Citicorp </s>
<s> Analysts were only slightly disappointed by Citicorp 's numbers . </s>
<s> `` There 's nothing in here that 's horrible and nothing to make you think they 're setting the world on fire , '' said Carole Berger , analyst for C.J. Lawrence , Morgan Grenfell Inc . </s>
<s> Earnings from the bank 's global consumer business grew 27 % . </s>
<s> `` The consumer business continues to drive the earnings stream , '' said Mr. McDermott of Keefe , Bruyette & Woods . </s>
<s> Corporate finance and trading results in member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development were `` relatively flat , sometimes choppy , '' the bank said , and profit for the area sank 27 % . </s>
<s> The cross-border loan portfolio reflected `` adjustment problems and episodic payment patterns , '' the bank said no interest payments from Argentina in the nine months and none from Brazil in the third quarter , while Venezuela brought itself `` substantially current . '' </s>
<s> Overall , the portfolio narrowed its quarterly loss to $ 70 million from $ 80 million a year earlier . </s>
<s> `` People were waiting to see if we would take an additional provision '' for medium-term and long-term loans to less-developed countries , a Citicorp spokesman said . </s>
<s> But he reiterated the bank 's position that it is comfortable with the current level of $ 2.6 billion , covering about 30 % of the $ 8.9 billion of such loans outstanding . </s>
<s> Ronald I. Mandle , analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. , called Citicorp 's venture-capital gains of $ 93 million before taxes `` strong . '' </s>
<s> A `` concerning '' item the analyst cited was the 10 % jump in expenses , which the bank attributes to costs of expanding both its consumer credit-card operations and its overseas branch business . </s>
<s> Citicorp 's spokesman said , however , that the bank is maintaining those expenses in proportion to revenue growth . </s>
<s> Wells Fargo </s>
<s> Wells Fargo continued to generate one of the highest profit margins among major banks , minimizing a drop in net interest margin with 13 % third-quarter growth in high-yielding business loans and similar growth in mortgages . </s>
<s> Its margin fell only seven basis points , or 7\/100ths of a percentage point , from a year ago , compared with a 13-point drop at Security Pacific Corp. and much larger declines among banks in other parts of the country . </s>
<s> As a result , Wells Fargo 's net interest income rose $ 36.3 million , or 7 % , to $ 537 million for the quarter . </s>
<s> Non-interest income fell slightly to $ 191.9 million from $ 193.3 million , while Wells Fargo continued to rigorously control non-interest expense , which was almost flat at $ 393.4 million . </s>
<s> The combination of solid loan growth with tight expense control gave Wells Fargo a 1.25 % return on average assets for the quarter , about 40 % higher than Security Pacific 's and a profit ratio matched by only two or three other major banks in the U.S. . </s>
<s> Wells Fargo 's return on equity increased to 24.4 % from 23.8 % . </s>
<s> Wells Fargo has sold all of its non-trade loans made to less-developed countries , and managed to partly reverse the sharp rise in domestic non-accrual loans , which fell 8 % from the previous quarter to $ 806.8 million from $ 880.9 million . </s>
<s> But the amount was still 39 % higher than the year-ago level , and 25 % higher as a percentage of total loans . </s>
<s> That trend , and Wells Fargo 's heavy exposure to leveraged buy-outs , are about the only worries analysts have about Wells Fargo 's financial picture . </s>
<s> Wells Fargo is rebuilding its loan-loss reserve , which increased to $ 711 million at Sept. 30 from $ 664 million the previous quarter but was down from $ 852 million a year ago , when the bank still had some shaky foreign loans . </s>
<s> Manufacturers Hanover </s>
<s> Manufacturers Hanover said that excluding the addition to its reserves , certain tax benefits , and a one-time $ 16 million gain on the sale of an interest in a foreign leasing company , third-quarter earnings were $ 75 million . </s>
<s> The comparable year-earlier number was $ 56 million , a spokesman said . </s>
<s> The bank 's additional provisions brought reserves for loans to less-developed countries to $ 2.4 billion , covering 36 % of its medium and long-term loans outstanding to these nations . </s>
<s> The net interest margin - the difference between the bank 's cost of funds and what it receives as interest payments -- improved in the quarter , as did certain areas of wholesale banking . </s>
<s> Fees from syndicating loans dropped 48 % , to $ 21 million . </s>
<s> `` We did n't take part in a lot of deals '' in the quarter `` because their credit quality was poor , '' the spokesman said . </s>
<s> Expenses unrelated to interest rose 5.4 % , to $ 541 million . </s>
<s> PNC Financial </s>
<s> PNC Financial cited higher income from sources unrelated to interest and said it continues to cut costs . </s>
<s> Net interest income in the third quarter edged up 1.4 % , to $ 317.7 million . </s>
<s> Trust income grew 15 % , to $ 49.9 million , while service charges , fees and commissions increased 22 % , to $ 79.4 million . </s>
<s> The bank 's total allowance for credit losses was $ 502.1 million , or 1.82 % of total loans . </s>
