<s> Eastern Airlines ' creditors committee , unhappy with the carrier 's plans for emerging from bankruptcy-law proceedings , asked its own experts to devise alternate approaches to a reorganization . </s>
<s> Representatives of the accounting firm of Ernst & Young and the securities firm of Goldman , Sachs & Co. , hired by creditors to consult on Eastern 's financial plans , told the committee in a private meeting yesterday that Eastern 's latest plan to emerge from bankruptcy-law protection is far riskier than an earlier one which won the creditors ' approval . </s>
<s> According to one person present at the meeting , Eastern 's new plan is financially `` overly optimistic . '' </s>
<s> Asked about the consultants ' reports , an Eastern spokeswoman said `` we totally disagree . '' </s>
<s> She said they have `` oversimplified and made some erroneous assumptions that make their analysis completely off-base . '' </s>
<s> At a later news conference here , Frank Lorenzo , chairman of Eastern 's parent Texas Air Corp. , said Eastern was exceeding its goals for getting back into operation and predicted it would emerge from Chapter 11 protection from creditors early next year , operating with more service than it originally had scheduled . </s>
<s> He insisted , as he has before , that creditors would be paid in full under the plan . </s>
<s> Mr. Lorenzo made no mention of creditors ' negative response to his plan . </s>
<s> `` We 're in the process of discussing an amended plan with the creditors and anticipate filing that amended plan shortly , '' Mr. Lorenzo told reporters . </s>
<s> `` We 're meeting and surpassing our goals , '' he added . </s>
<s> In July , Eastern and its creditors agreed on a reorganization plan that called for Eastern to sell $ 1.8 billion in assets and to emerge from bankruptcy-law protection at two-thirds its former size . </s>
<s> But after selling off pieces such as its East Coast shuttle , its Philadelphia hub and various planes , Eastern hit a stumbling block . </s>
<s> It could n't sell its South American routes , one of the major assets marked for disposal . </s>
<s> Those routes , valued by the creditors ' professionals at about $ 400 million , were to be sold to AMR Corp. 's American Airlines . </s>
<s> A last-minute snag in negotiations with AMR , over an unrelated lawsuit between American and another Texas Air unit , caused the deal to collapse . </s>
<s> Eastern ultimately decided it would have to keep and operate the routes itself , which would leave it with less cash for its reorganization . </s>
<s> It also would leave Eastern a bigger carrier than the scaled-down one proposed under the initial plan . </s>
<s> Those changes in its condition meant the reorganization plan previously presented to creditors would have to be revamped . </s>
<s> Since then , Eastern has been negotiating with creditors over revisions , but the creditors committee has been having problems with the revisions . </s>
<s> The committee has two groups of experts it calls on to analyze Eastern 's plans . </s>
<s> Both said the new plan would n't work . </s>
<s> Ernst & Young said Eastern 's plans will miss its projections of earnings before interest , tax and depreciation by $ 100 million , and that Eastern 's plan presented no comfort level , according to a source present at yesterday 's session . </s>
<s> Experts from Goldman Sachs estimated Eastern would miss the same mark by $ 120 million to $ 135 million , the source said . </s>
<s> The experts said they expected Eastern would have to issue new debt to cover its costs , and that it would generate far less cash than anticipated . </s>
<s> Other costs also would increase , including maintenance , because Eastern has an older fleet . </s>
<s> At the news conference , Mr. Lorenzo and Eastern President Phil Bakes presented a far rosier assessment . </s>
<s> Flanked by flight attendants , pilots and gate agents dressed in spiffy new blue uniforms , they said Eastern has exceeded its operational goals and is filling its seats . </s>
<s> Starting next month , Eastern will begin flying 775 flights daily instead of the previously announced 700 , they said . </s>
<s> Mr. Bakes declined to give out Eastern 's daily losses , but said he did n't expect Eastern would have to dip into the cash from asset sales currently held in escrow . </s>
<s> These accounts hold several hundred million dollars , primarily from asset sales . </s>
<s> The plan Eastern hopes to pursue , he said , calls for Eastern to have $ 390 million in cash by year 's end . </s>
<s> Both he and Mr. Lorenzo predicted that plan might be confirmed in January . </s>
<s> As to negotiations with creditors , Mr. Lorenzo said in remarks after the conference `` we 'll have to see how they -LCB- talks -RCB- come along . '' </s>
<s> However , he added , `` it 's not a requirement that the plan be accepted by creditors . </s>
<s> It must be accepted by the court . '' </s>
<s> Under bankruptcy law , Eastern has exclusive rights for a certain period to develop its own reorganization plan . </s>
<s> That deadline has been extended once and could be extended again . </s>
<s> If Eastern can get creditor support , court confirmation of its plan could be relatively swift . </s>
<s> But creditors are free to press for court approval of their own plan , or the court could ignore both sides and draw its own . </s>
<s> In any event , some people familiar with the case question whether the court will act by January as forecast by Mr. Lorenzo and Mr. Bakes . </s>
<s> Eastern sought bankruptcy-law protection a few days after a crippling strike began March 4 . </s>
<s> Mr. Lorenzo told reporters the reorganization Eastern is pursuing would create a carrier 85 % to 90 % of the size of the pre-bankruptcy Eastern . </s>
<s> He projected it would be operating about 1,000 flights a day by late spring , only slightly fewer than the carrier 's old volume of 1,050 a day . </s>
