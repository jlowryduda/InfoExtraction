<s> Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi set a date next month for general elections that some analysts say could cost him and his ruling Congress -LRB- I -RRB- Party control of the government . </s>
<s> Other analysts say the Indian leader could retain control with a slim majority or be forced to rule as the dominant partner in a coalition with other parties . </s>
<s> Elections in this large , diverse and passionate nation are always hard to predict . </s>
<s> Much depends on the opposition , a loose group of regional and ideological parties led by former Gandhi cabinet minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh . </s>
<s> The biggest certainty is that the elections will be a vote for or against Mr. Gandhi and his five years in power -- five years of ups and downs , promises and disappointments and wide fluctuations in popularity . </s>
<s> Yesterday , four days after an unusual parliamentary defeat for the ruling party , Mr. Gandhi called elections for the lower house of Parliament on Nov. 22 and 24 . </s>
<s> The elections will be held in different states on one of the two days . </s>
<s> -LRB- The lower house 's five-year term expires in January ; the Parliament 's upper house is appointed . -RRB- </s>
<s> The elections will be a rigorous test for the 45-year-old prime minister and Congress -LRB- I -RRB- , which in various forms has ruled for 40 of India 's 42 years of independence . </s>
<s> After a landslide win in 1984 in polls held after the assassination of his mother , Indira Gandhi , Mr. Gandhi saw his popularity begin a roller coaster ride . </s>
<s> His early promises to make India a modern nation remain bogged down in bloated bureaucracy . </s>
<s> His pledge to clean up local administration and Indian politics , including his own party , went unfulfilled . </s>
<s> His `` Mr. Clean '' image was muddied by an arms-kickback scandal , which will be a major campaign issue . </s>
<s> Some analysts predict that disappointment in Mr. Gandhi 's spent pledge to reduce corruption and heavy-handed local government will crest at the polls . </s>
<s> `` There 's a wide feeling of indignation across the country , '' says Bhabani Sen Gupta of the Center for Policy Research , in New Delhi . </s>
<s> `` I think the people will be judging the regime by a petty policeman , by a corrupt revenue collector . </s>
<s> This could be a big protest against an administrative failure . '' </s>
<s> Even if the Congress -LRB- I -RRB- retains control of the government , Mr. Gandhi 's ability to push through major initiatives might be hobbled by a thinner majority . </s>
<s> Economic analysts call his trail-blazing liberalization of the Indian economy incomplete , and many are hoping for major new liberalizations if he is returned firmly to power . </s>
<s> The Lok Sabha , or lower house of Parliament , has 542 elected and two appointed seats . </s>
<s> In 1984 , the Congress -LRB- I -RRB- captured 405 seats , the largest victory in the history of Indian democracy . </s>
<s> The landslide was fueled by panic that prevailed in India at the time . </s>
<s> Mrs. Gandhi had been assassinated by separatist Sikhs , and many Indians feared their country might split apart . </s>
<s> In the previous three general elections , similar national issues clinched the vote . </s>
<s> In 1971 , the Congress Party won after India 's victory in the Bangladesh war . </s>
<s> In 1977 , Mrs. Gandhi was thrown out of office after her 19-month emergency rule , and in 1980 , after her successors made a mess of their three years in power , she was restored to office . </s>
<s> Most political analysts say that if Mr. Gandhi 's opposition unites to field single candidates in most precincts , the Congress -LRB- I -RRB- will lose big . </s>
<s> But if the opposition remains fractured , the Congress -LRB- I -RRB- could win a small majority , or lead a coalition government . </s>
<s> Chimanbhai Mehta , a parliamentarian and former Gandhi ally , predicts Congress -LRB- I -RRB- will win only 150 seats , a quarter of the house , if the opposition fields single candidates in 80 % of the races . </s>
<s> Analysts say the opposition will struggle this week to unite , and its success will be clear only when it announces its final list of parliamentary candidates . </s>
<s> The arms-kickback scandal is likely to be one of the big talking points in the campaign , but it 's unclear how it is viewed by average Indian voters . </s>
<s> In 1986 , India signed a $ 1.4 billion contract with AB Bofors , a unit of Nobel Industries Sweden AB , to purchase 400 artillery pieces . </s>
<s> The contract was negotiated by the countries ' two prime ministers , and was supposed to be free of commissions or agents ' costs . </s>
<s> In April 1987 , evidence surfaced that commissions were paid . </s>
<s> The opposition charged that the money was used to bribe Indian government officials , an allegation denied by Mr. Gandhi 's administration . </s>
<s> But many of his statements on the issue in Parliament subsequently were proven wrong by documentary evidence . </s>
<s> The scandal has faded and flared , but recent disclosures propelled it back onto the front pages , and that has helped galvanize the opposition , which last week blocked passage of two constitutional amendment bills . </s>
<s> It was the first time in 20 years that such government bills were defeated . </s>
<s> In a country where a bribe is needed to get a phone , a job , and even into a school , the name Bofors has become a potent rallying cry against the government . </s>
<s> That illustrates the kind of disappointment many Indians feel toward Mr. Gandhi , whom they zestfully elected and enthusiastically supported in his first two years in power . </s>
<s> His term has produced no spectacular failures in politics , in the economy or on the military front , and has chalked up some successes . </s>
<s> But the average Indian had tremendous hope in the youthful leader and his promise to make both government and the ruling party more effective and less corrupt . </s>
<s> His failures in those two areas deeply , and sometimes bitterly , disappointed many Indians . </s>
<s> `` We do n't like the Congress -LRB- I -RRB- , '' says Sooraji Jath , a farmer in the western state of Gujarat . </s>
<s> `` The Congress government is taking the farmers ' bread and not giving us any support . </s>
<s> When there are well problems , light problems , road problems , the government tells us to forget it . '' </s>
<s> The greatest thing going for Mr. Gandhi and the Congress -LRB- I -RRB- Party is the poor reputation of the opposition . </s>
<s> Even if it unites for the elections , its coherence is likely to be temporary . </s>
<s> When the Congress -LRB- I -RRB- lost the 1977 election , following Mrs. Gandhi 's hated emergency rule , a similar coalition took power and then disintegrated . </s>
<s> Many Indians fear a repeat of that experience . </s>
<s> March 24 , 1986 : </s>
<s> AB Bofors , a unit of Nobel Industries Sweden AB , enters into a $ 1.4 billion contract with India 's Defense Ministry to supply 400 Bofors FH-77B 155-mm field howitzer guns . </s>
<s> In 1985 , Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi , in his talks with then Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme , imposed the condition that the contract have no middlemen . </s>
<s> April 16 , 1987 : </s>
<s> Swedish National Radio reports that about $ 40 million -- nearly 3 % of the total contract -- was paid by Bofors as commissions to middlemen . </s>
<s> June 1 , 1987 : </s>
<s> Sweden 's National Audit Bureau releases its report confirming payment of about $ 40 million to unidentified Indians . </s>
<s> The report says that investigations were severely hampered by lack of cooperation from Bofors . </s>
<s> Bofors says it ca n't disclose the names of the middlemen because it would jeopardize industrial confidentiality . </s>
<s> A portion of the report containing names of the middlemen is withheld by officials citing bank secrecy requirements . </s>
<s> Aug. 6 , 1987 : </s>
<s> Prime Minister Gandhi tells the Indian Parliament , `` ... neither I nor any member of my family has received any consideration in these transactions . </s>
<s> That is the truth . '' </s>
<s> Aug. 26 , 1987 : </s>
<s> Bofors admits payments of $ 41 million to middlemen . </s>
<s> April 22 , 1988 : </s>

<s> April 26 , 1988 : </s>
<s> A parliamentary investigative committee dominated by the Congress -LRB- I -RRB- Party concludes that there were no middlemen in the deal and no payment to any Indian individual or company . </s>
<s> July 18 , 1989 : </s>
<s> The comptroller and auditor-general of India reports serious lapses in the government 's technical and financial evaluation of the Bofors deal . </s>
<s> Sept. 15 , 1989 : </s>
<s> Retired army Chief of Staff Krishnaswami Sundarji discloses in an interview that he suggested in May 1987 that the government cancel the Bofors contract . </s>
<s> According to Gen. Sundarji , that would have forced Bofors to disclose the names of the middlemen who received kickbacks from the company . </s>
<s> His recommendation was rejected by the government . </s>
<s> Oct. 9. 1989 : </s>
<s> The Hindu newspaper publishes the withheld portion of the Swedish National Audit Bureau 's report . </s>
