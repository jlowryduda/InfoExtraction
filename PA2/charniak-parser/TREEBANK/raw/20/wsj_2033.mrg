<s> HOPES OF SIMPLIFYING the corporate minimum tax before 1990 are weakening . </s>
<s> The method of calculating the 20 % tax , paid if it exceeds tax figured the regular way , is due for a change in 1990 , thanks to 1986 's tax act . </s>
<s> But most experts agree that the concept that is to be introduced drags in great complexity ; they have been trying to head it off this year . </s>
<s> Ways and Means Chairman Rostenkowski backed a simplification plan in the pending House tax bill , but the plan turns out to be a big revenue loser . </s>
<s> Now the Senate 's stripped-down bill omits any proposal to deal with the corporate tax . </s>
<s> Proponents of simplification fear that the chances of getting it into the final bill are waning . </s>
<s> `` We hear it has low priority on the House side , '' says Samuel Starr of Coopers & Lybrand , CPAs . </s>
<s> If the law is n't changed , he says , `` we are left staring at rules that are almost impossible to implement , because there are so many complex depreciation calculations to do . '' </s>
<s> But Congress still could resolve the issue with other legislation this year or next , Starr adds . </s>
<s> HUGO 'S RAVAGES may be offset by immediate claims for tax refunds . </s>
<s> This law aids hurricane-wracked locales named by the president as disaster areas , as well as regions so designated after other 1989 disasters . </s>
<s> It lets victims elect to deduct casualty losses on either 1989 or amended 1988 returns , whichever offers the larger tax benefit ; they have until April 16 to choose . </s>
<s> Amending a 1988 return to claim a refund brings cash faster ; but for personal losses , there are other factors to consider , notes publisher Prentice Hall . </s>
<s> A loss -- after insurance recoveries -- is deductible only to the extent that it exceeds $ 100 and that the year 's total losses exceed 10 % of adjusted gross income ; victims may pick the year when income is lower and deductions higher . </s>
<s> In filing an original -LRB- not amended -RRB- return , a couple should consider whether damaged property is owned jointly or separately and whether one spouse has larger income ; that may determine whether they should file jointly or separately . </s>
<s> THE IRS DELAYS several deadlines for Hugo 's victims . </s>
<s> Returns for 1988 from people with six-month filing extensions were due Monday , but the IRS says people in the disaster areas wo n't be penalized for late filing if their returns are marked `` Hugo '' and postmarked by Jan. 16 . </s>
<s> Interest will be imposed on unpaid taxes , but late-payment penalties on the returns will be waived if the balance due and paid is 10 % or less of the liability . </s>
<s> IRS Notice 89-136 describes this and other deadline relief for Hugo 's victims . </s>
<s> Among the provisions : Fiscal-year taxpayers with returns due last Monday wo n't be penalized if they file -- or request an extension -- and pay tax due by Nov. 15 . </s>
<s> Excise-tax returns due by Oct. 31 or Nov. 30 may be delayed to Jan. 16 . </s>
<s> Extensions ca n't be granted for filing employment-tax returns due Oct. 31 or for depositing withheld taxes , but late penalties will be abated for deposits made by Nov. 15 . </s>
<s> The notice also grants relief for certain estate-tax returns . </s>
<s> ONE-DAY JAUNTS in a chartered boat were perks for permanent staffers of American Business Service Corp. , a Costa Mesa , Calif. , supplier of temporary workers . </s>
<s> The IRS denied cost deductions because few of the temps got to go aboard . </s>
<s> But the Tax Court said the limitations were reasonable and realistic and allowed the deductions . </s>
<s> USED-CAR BUYERS who try to avoid sales tax by understating prices paid in private deals are the targets of a New York drive . </s>
<s> Estimating that the state may lose $ 15 million a year , officials announced the filing of 15 criminal actions and `` hundreds '' of civil penalties . </s>
<s> WHEN AN IRA OWNER dies , the trustee of the individual retirement account must file forms 5498 reporting market values relating to the decedent and each beneficiary , with copies to the executor and beneficiaries . </s>
<s> IRS Revenue Procedure 89-52 describes the reporting requirements . </s>
<s> BIGGER THAN A BREADBOX was this cash hoarder 's reputation for honesty . </s>
<s> People often cite frugality and distrust of banks to justify cash caches to the IRS . </s>
<s> Gregory Damonne Brown of Fremont , Calif. , a hardworking , reclusive young bachelor , told that story to the Tax Court . </s>
<s> But judges usually find the real aim is to escape tax on hidden income ; and the IRS said Brown must have had such income -- although it uncovered no source -- because he deposited $ 124,732 in a bank account in 1982-84 while reporting income of only $ 52,012 . </s>
<s> Brown 's story : </s>
<s> The deposits came from savings kept in a Tupperware breadbox ; he saved $ 47,000 in 1974-81 by living with family members and pinching pennies and $ 45,000 of secret gifts from his remorseful father , who had abandoned the family in 1955 . </s>
<s> Brown had no proof ; but testimony of his mother and stepmother about his father and of an ex-employer about his honesty and habits satisfied a judge that Brown was truthful and his tale of gifts was possible . </s>
<s> The IRS offered no evidence of hidden sources of taxable income , so Judge Shields rejected its claims . </s>
<s> BRIEFS : </s>
<s> Asked how he made charitable gifts of $ 26,350 out of reported two-year income of $ 46,892 , Thomas H. McFall of Bryan , Texas , told the Tax Court he had understated his income . </s>
<s> The court rejected his incredible claims , denied his deductions , and imposed a negligence penalty ... . </s>
<s> Rep. Schaefer -LRB- R. , Colo. -RRB- entered a bill to exempt from tax rewards for tips leading to the arrest of violent criminals . </s>
