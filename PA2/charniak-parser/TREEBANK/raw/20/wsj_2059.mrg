<s> It is now a commonplace that prosecutors are bringing criminal indictments in cases where until a few years ago only a civil action at most would have been brought . </s>
<s> Yet it is also axiomatic that the power to create new crimes belongs only to the legislature , and not to courts . </s>
<s> Beginning in the early 19th century , with U.S. v. Hudson and Goodwin , the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that a judicial power to declare conduct to be against the public interest and hence criminal , while well established in British law , would usurp legislative authority under the doctrine of separation of powers . </s>
<s> That 's the conventional theory anyway . </s>
<s> In practice , however , the line between interpretation and redefinition of the criminal law long ago began to blur . </s>
<s> In particular , a common law of white-collar crime has developed with surprising rapidity over the past decade . </s>
<s> For example , although insider trading has long been criminal , it has never been statutorily defined . </s>
<s> In 1983 , the Supreme Court tried to supply a workable definition in the Dirks v. SEC decision , which found that liability depended on whether the tipper had breached his fiduciary duty to the corporation in order to obtain `` some personal gain '' and whether the tippee knew or recklessly disregarded this fact . </s>
<s> Gradually , however , lower courts and prosecutors have pushed this definition to its breaking point . </s>
<s> Consider the facts underlying the 1989 conviction of Robert Chestman . </s>
<s> Prior to a tender offer by A&P for Waldbaum Inc. in 1986 , the founder of the Waldbaum 's supermarket chain called an elderly relative to tell her to assemble her stock certificates for delivery . </s>
<s> She called her daughter to take her to the bank , who , in turn , persuaded her husband , a Mr. Loeb , to run this errand . </s>
<s> Hearing of this information , the husband discussed it with his broker , Mr. Chestman , and Mr. Chestman then bought for his own account and other clients . </s>
<s> Basically , Mr. Chestman was a fourth-level tippee . </s>
<s> Did Mr. Loeb , his tipper , breach a fiduciary duty -LRB- and , if so , to whom -RRB- ? </s>
<s> Did Mr. Loeb seek personal gain -LRB- and if so , how -RRB- ? </s>
<s> Or did Mr. Chestman only hear a market rumor -LRB- which one may lawfully trade upon -RRB- ? </s>
<s> The line seems awfully thin for criminal-law purposes . </s>
<s> A second illustration is supplied by the recent guilty plea entered by Robert Freeman , formerly head of arbitrage at Goldman , Sachs & Co . </s>
<s> Essentially , Mr. Freeman had invested heavily in the Beatrice leveraged buy-out , when he was told by another prominent trader , Bernard `` Bunny '' Lasker , that the deal was in trouble . </s>
<s> After placing orders to sell , Mr. Freeman called Martin Siegel , an investment banker at Kidder , Peabody & Co. , who was advising on the deal , to confirm these rumors . </s>
<s> Mr. Siegel asked Mr. Freeman who his source was and , on hearing that it was Bunny Lasker , responded : `` Well , your bunny has a good nose . '' </s>
<s> The illegal `` tip '' of the bunny 's good nose was then largely a confirmation of rumors already known to many in the market . </s>
<s> Had the case gone to trial the same issues would have surfaced : </s>
<s> Was there a fiduciary breach in order to obtain personal gain ? </s>
<s> Did Mr. Freeman have notice of this ? </s>
<s> Finally , was the information material ? </s>
<s> Yet , all these issues are subsidiary to a more central issue : Who is and who should be making the criminal law here ? </s>
<s> It is not my contention that either Mr. Chestman or Mr. Freeman was an innocent victim of prosecutorial overzealousness . </s>
<s> Arguably , both were on notice that their behavior was at least risky . </s>
<s> But even if they behaved recklessly , reasons still exist to fear and resist this steady process of case-by-case judicial extension of the law of insider trading . </s>
<s> Courts and legislatures make decisions in very different ways and are each susceptible to very different kinds of errors . </s>
<s> After-the-fact judicial examination of an actor 's conduct has always been the common law 's method . </s>
<s> When only civil liability is involved , this method has the undeniable strengths of factual specificity and avoidance of overgeneralization . </s>
<s> Still , case-by-case retrospective decision making of this sort is vulnerable to the tunnel vision caused by a fixation on ad hoc -LRB- and usually sleazy -RRB- examples . </s>
<s> When a court decides that a particular actor 's conduct was culpable and so extends the definition of insider trading to reach this conduct , it does not see the potentially enormous number of other cases that will be covered by the expanded rule . </s>
<s> Thus , a court is poorly positioned to make judgments about the social utility of the expanded rule . </s>
<s> For example , in focusing on Mr. Freeman 's attempt to gain nonpublic information about a deal 's collapse , one does not naturally think about the reverse side of the coin : What if the rumor had been false ? </s>
<s> Can a security analyst call an investment banker to make certain that a seemingly improbable rumor is in fact false ? </s>
<s> In the past , not only would reputable professionals have rushed to check out such rumors with the company , but companies listed on the major stock exchanges were encouraged by the exchanges to respond openly to such inquiries from securities analysts . </s>
<s> Today , after Mr. Freeman 's plea , there is an uncertainty that is both unfair and inefficient . </s>
<s> In this light , the comparative advantages of legislative law-making become clear : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Before it acts , the legislature typically will hear the views of representatives of all those affected by its decision , not just the immediate parties before the court ; and -LRB- 2 -RRB- the legislature can frame `` bright line '' standards that create less uncertainty than the fact-bound decisions of courts . </s>
<s> Although legislative lines can result in under-inclusion -LRB- which explains why the SEC has long resisted a legislative definition of insider trading -RRB- , judicial lawmaking inevitably creates uncertainty because of the shadowy outer edges and implications of most judicial decisions . </s>
<s> At least when the stakes are high , uncertainty in turn results in overinclusion , as individuals do not dare to approach an uncertain line closely . </s>
<s> The federal mail and wire fraud statutes provide even better illustrations of the rapid evolution of a federal common law of white-collar crime . </s>
<s> In 1987 , the Supreme Court attempted in McNally v. U.S. to halt the inexorable expansion of these statutes by adopting a rule of strict construction for ambiguous criminal statues . </s>
<s> Yet , late last year , Congress effectively reversed this decision by enacting a one-sentence statute that defined fraud to include any scheme to deprive another of `` the intangible right of honest services . '' </s>
<s> At a stroke , this may criminalize all fiduciary breaches -LRB- and possibly all misrepresentations by an agent or employee -RRB- . </s>
<s> Such a statute illustrates the fundamental problem : Congress finds it is easier to pass sweepingly moralistic prohibitions , which the courts must thereafter interpret , than to engage in the difficult line-drawing distinctions that are inherently its responsibility . </s>
<s> We are confronted less with a judicial power grab than with a legislative giveaway . </s>
<s> Predictably , when confronted with morally dubious behavior , prosecutors will exploit the latitude such openended statutes give them . </s>
<s> Over the long run , however , sleazy cases will make bad law . </s>
