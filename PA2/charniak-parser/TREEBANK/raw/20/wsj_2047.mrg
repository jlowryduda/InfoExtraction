<s> The nations of southern Africa know a lot about managing elephants ; their herds are thriving . </s>
<s> But the nations of Europe and North America have decided they know better . </s>
<s> At this week 's U.N. conference in Lausanne , they imposed a global ivory ban that seeks to overturn local policies . </s>
<s> A Zimbabwean delegate argued that the ban would `` guarantee the extinction of the elephant . '' </s>
<s> Legitimate ranchers , who have an interest in preserving the herds , would go out of business . </s>
<s> Poachers would control the underground trade . </s>
<s> Many delegates were willing to craft a compromise , but U.S. delegate Constance Harriman and others thundered that down . </s>
<s> The Greens from the First World wanted a morality play , not a negotiation . </s>
<s> Fortunately , the nations of southern Africa have n't totally surrendered their sovereignty . </s>
<s> Five countries announced they would not honor what one Zimbabwean delegate wryly called the `` made in Switzerland '' solution . </s>
<s> In fact , they seemed a mite resentful . </s>
<s> The director of Zimbabwe 's Wildlife Department described American conservationists as `` fat little puppies from urban environments who do n't know a thing about Africa . '' </s>
<s> That 's not fair ; they 're not all fat . </s>
