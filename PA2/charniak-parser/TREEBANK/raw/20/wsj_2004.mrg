<s> Arbitragers were n't the only big losers in the collapse of UAL Corp. stock . </s>
<s> Look at what happened to UAL 's chairman , Stephen M. Wolf , and its chief financial officer , John C. Pope . </s>
<s> On a day some United Airlines employees wanted Mr. Wolf fired and takeover stock speculators wanted his scalp , Messrs. Wolf and Pope saw their prospective personal fortunes continue to plummet as shares of UAL , United 's parent company , dived $ 24.875 on the Big Board to close at $ 198 . </s>
<s> Including Monday 's plunge , that has given the two executives paper losses of $ 49.5 million , based on what they would have realized had the pilots and management-led buy-out of UAL gone through at $ 300 a share . </s>
<s> When bank financing for the buy-out collapsed last week , so did UAL 's stock . </s>
<s> Even if the banks resurrect a financing package at $ 250 a share , the two executives would still get about $ 25 million less than they stood to gain in the initial transaction . </s>
<s> Mr. Wolf owns 75,000 UAL shares and has options to buy another 250,000 at $ 83.3125 each . </s>
<s> In the $ 300-a-share buyout , that totaled about $ 76.7 million . </s>
<s> By yesterday 's close of trading , it was good for a paltry $ 43.5 million . </s>
<s> Of course , Mr. Wolf , 48 years old , has some savings . </s>
<s> He left his last two jobs at Republic Airlines and Flying Tiger with combined stock-option gains of about $ 22 million , and UAL gave him a $ 15 million bonus when it hired him . </s>
<s> His 1988 salary was $ 575,000 , with a $ 575,000 bonus . </s>
<s> The 40-year old Mr. Pope has n't changed jobs enough -- at least the right ones -- to stash away that kind of money . </s>
<s> United paid him a $ 375,000 bonus to lure him away from American Airlines , and he was paid a salary of $ 342,122 last year with a $ 280,000 bonus . </s>
<s> Mr. Pope owns 10,000 UAL shares and has options to buy another 150,000 at $ 69 each . </s>
<s> That came to a combined $ 37.7 million under the $ 300-a-share buy-out , but just $ 21.3 million at yesterday 's close . </s>
<s> Of the combined $ 114.4 million the two men were scheduled to reap under the buy-out , they agreed to invest in the buy-out just $ 15 million , angering many of the thousands of workers asked to make pay concessions so the buy-out would be a success . </s>
<s> United 's directors voted themselves , and their spouses , lifetime access to the Friendly Skies -- free first-class travel , and $ 20,000 a year for life as well . </s>
<s> Conceivably , in a scaled-back buy-out , they could be bumped back to coach seats for life . </s>
