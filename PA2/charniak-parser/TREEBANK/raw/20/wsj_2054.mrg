<s> We 're sorry to report that on Monday President Bush accepted the resignation of William Allen as chairman of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission . </s>
<s> Mr. Allen , appointed by President Reagan , grew understandably tired of dealing with the guerrilla tactics of his enemies . </s>
<s> His recent speech , provocatively titled `` Blacks ? Animals ? Homosexuals ? What is a Minority ? '' caused an uproar when its title leaked out . </s>
<s> Mr. Allen 's commissioners voted to call his unread speech `` thoughtless , disgusting and unnecessarily inflammatory . '' </s>
<s> Commissioner Mary Francis Berry said it was `` another sad episode in the saga of the unguided missile who is chairman . '' </s>
<s> Rep. Don Edwards , the California Democrat , warned Mr. Allen that the speech would be `` outside the scope of the commission 's jurisdiction . '' </s>
<s> Thomas Stoddard , head of the Lambda Legal Defense Fund , called the prospect of the speech `` frankly shocking . '' </s>
<s> We 've actually read the speech . </s>
<s> Mr. Allen began it with a warning to his hosts , a California church group that opposes rights for homosexuals . </s>
<s> He said that other participants in the conference `` do not believe that the rights of Americans should be guaranteed to citizens who are homosexual , '' but that `` I mean to persuade you to the opposite view . '' </s>
<s> He recalled to the audience a `` strange , infelicitous '' analogy he once heard arguing `` now that we have finally recognized that American blacks have rights , we need to do the same for animals . </s>
<s> '' Mr. Allen objected to this analogy because it seems to `` assimilate the status of blacks to that of animals -- as a mere project of charity , of humaneness . '' </s>
<s> Rights on such a basis , whether for blacks or homosexuals , are `` mere indulgences , '' he said , subject to being taken back . </s>
<s> He says the title of his speech was to make his point that Americans have rights as individuals , not as members of certain select groups . </s>
<s> His speech criticized the `` idiocy of notions of protected groups in society '' as opposed to individual equality or , as he put it , in `` a common destiny as Americans . '' </s>
<s> Instead of lobbying for special treatment , Mr. Allen said that homosexuals and others should try to ensure equal treatment under the law and not aim for special privileges that would risk `` invidious retrenchment with government complicity . '' </s>
<s> This hardly sounds like an anti-homosexual screed . </s>
<s> What 's really going on here ? </s>
<s> The three most important things to understand about Mr. Allen is that he is a black conservative intellectual -- a triple threat to the liberal establishment . </s>
<s> Mr. Allen , who teaches government at prestigious Harvey Mudd College in California and will remain a member of the commission , has spent years arguing that civil rights are individuals ' rights . </s>
<s> He last made waves when he dared to defend an Indian girl who had been adopted by non-Indian parents off her reservation . </s>
<s> Mr. Allen quickly ran up against the liberal establishment again , which somehow elevated the vague concept of `` Indian rights '' above the rights of individual Indians . </s>
<s> There is a huge divide between Mr. Allen 's we're-all-in-this-together view and the divisive litigation approach of the civil rights groups . </s>
<s> Indeed , the gap is so large that Mr. Allen 's critics refuse to engage the debate . </s>
<s> Their ridicule of him is no substitute for argument . </s>
<s> Their effort to run him out of Washington is an embarrassment to the original purpose of their own movement . </s>
<s> We hope the next head of the Civil Rights Commission will be as brave as Mr. Allen in making the case for equality of civil rights . </s>
