<s> The prices of corn futures contracts jumped amid rumors that the Soviet Union is keeping up its dizzying October buying binge of U.S. corn . </s>
<s> Those rumors were confirmed after the end of trading yesterday when the U.S. Agriculture Department announced that the Soviets had bought 1.2 million metric tons of U.S. corn , bringing their U.S. corn purchases confirmed so far this month to about five million metric tons . </s>
<s> In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade , the corn contract for December delivery jumped 5.75 cents a bushel to settle at $ 2.44 a bushel . </s>
<s> The Soviet purchases are close to exceeding what some analysts had expected the Soviet Union to buy this fall , the season in which it usually buys much of the corn it imports from the U.S. . </s>
<s> That pace is causing some analysts to speculate that the Soviet Union might soon purchase as much as another two million metric tons . </s>
<s> One sign that more Soviet purchases are possible is that U.S. grain companies yesterday bought an unusually large amount of corn futures contracts . </s>
<s> That sometimes signals that they are laying plans to export corn . </s>
<s> By some estimates , several grain companies combined bought contracts for the possession of roughly one million metric tons of corn . </s>
<s> By buying futures contracts , these companies attempt to protect themselves from swings in the price of the corn that they are obligated to deliver . </s>
<s> Rumors of Soviet interest also pushed up the prices of soybean futures contracts . </s>
<s> Among other things , the Agriculture Department is widely thought to be mulling whether to subsidize the sale of soybean oil to the Soviet Union . </s>
<s> On top of all this , corn and soybean prices rose on reports that the Midwest harvest was disrupted by a freakishly early snow storm that dumped several inches in parts of Indiana and Ohio . </s>
<s> The harvest delays , however , are expected to be temporary . </s>
<s> Balmy temperatures are forecast for next week , said Robert Lekberg , an analyst at Farmers Grain & Livestock Corp. , Chicago . </s>
<s> Many farmers used the jump in prices to sell their recently harvested crop to grain elevator companies . </s>
<s> The heavy selling by farmers helped to damp the price rally . </s>
<s> Wheat futures prices rose slightly . </s>
<s> In other commodity markets yesterday : </s>
<s> PRECIOUS METALS : </s>
<s> Futures prices declined . </s>
<s> A number of developments were negatively interpreted by traders . </s>
<s> December delivery gold fell $ 1.80 an ounce to $ 370.60 . </s>
<s> December silver eased 2.7 cents an ounce to $ 5.133 . </s>
<s> January platinum was down $ 3.60 an ounce at $ 491.10 . </s>
<s> One price-depressing development was the lower-than-expected increase of only 0.2 % in the consumer price index for September , an analyst said . </s>
<s> He noted that the `` core inflation rate , '' which excludes food and energy , was also low at 0.2 % . </s>
<s> Other news that weighed on the market : Initial unemployment claims rose by 62,000 last week ; American Telephone & Telegraph Co. will reduce its managerial staff by 15,000 through attrition ; the oil market turned weaker ; there was n't any investor demand for bullion ; and the dollar strengthened during the day , putting pressure on gold . </s>
<s> Also , the analyst said , economic circumstances are such that both South Africa and the Soviet Union , the principal gold and platinum producers , are being forced to continue selling the metals . </s>
<s> Both are in great need of foreign exchange , and South Africa is also under pressure to meet foreign loan commitments , he said . </s>
<s> `` Putting it all together , we have a negative scenario that does n't look like it will improve overnight , '' he said . </s>
<s> COPPER : </s>
<s> Futures prices recovered in quiet trading . </s>
<s> The December contract rose 1.50 cents a pound to $ 1.2795 . </s>
<s> That contract fell a total of 5.75 cents during the first three days of this week , mostly in reaction to last Friday 's stock market plunge , which prompted concern that it might signal a similar sharp slowing of the U.S. economy and thus reduced demand for copper , a leading industrial metal . </s>
<s> In recent days , however , there has been increased purchasing of copper in London , an analyst said . </s>
<s> Some of this buying was by Japan , which has had its supplies sharply reduced by long production stoppages at the Bougainville mine in Papua New Guinea , Highland Valley mine in British Columbia , and the Cananea mine in Mexico , which are major shippers to Japan . </s>
<s> The increasing likelihood that Cananea and Highland Valley will soon return to production may have cut some of that purchasing , but even if any of these mines begin operating soon , their output wo n't be significant until at least the end of the year , analysts note . </s>
<s> So , one analyst said , even though the long-term production problems may be easing , there will still be a significant need for copper over the next three months , when inventories will remain relatively low . </s>
<s> ENERGY : </s>
<s> Crude oil prices ended mixed . </s>
<s> West Texas Intermediate for November delivery fell 14 cents a barrel to $ 20.42 . </s>
<s> But so-called outer month contracts finished higher . </s>
<s> For instance , December contracts for WTI rose 17 cents to $ 20.42 . </s>
<s> Most energy futures opened lower , following Wednesday 's market downturn . </s>
<s> But a flurry of late trading yesterday beefed up prices . </s>
<s> Heating oil and gasoline futures ended higher as well . </s>
