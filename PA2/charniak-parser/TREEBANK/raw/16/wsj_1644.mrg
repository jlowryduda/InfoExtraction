<s> Investors who received Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 's latest stock commentary may be left with blank expressions . </s>
<s> The first 10 pages of the 76-page Weekly Portfolio Perspective are completely blank , except for the page numbers . </s>
<s> Rather than printing devils , Shearson puts all the blame on the unpredictable stock market . </s>
<s> The plunge made Shearson 's market commentary instantly out of date . </s>
<s> In fact , last Friday 's 190.58-point tumble in the stock market caught many people and businesses by surprise , not the least of them brokerage firms such as Shearson that print their weekly market commentaries on Fridays for dissemination the following week . </s>
<s> Shearson , a 62%-owned unit of American Express Co. , did n't have enough time to update its market commentary so , `` We decided to kill our strategy pieces , '' says Jack Rivkin , the head of Shearson 's research department . </s>
<s> The first thought some investors had was that a red-faced Shearson must have been wildly bullish on stocks in its original commentary , and that 's why it purged its pages . </s>
<s> Investors recalled that Shearson last week had been advising that `` the market is still exhibiting all the signs of a further advance . '' </s>
<s> Many other brokerage firms had similarly bullish views . </s>
<s> But Mr. Rivkin insists that the 10 pages were n't pulled because they were too bullish . </s>
<s> Instead , he says , `` they were cautious , and that was n't the message we wanted to deliver '' on Monday . </s>
<s> As Mr. Rivkin explains it , `` We were raising some caution flags about rate rises in Europe and concerns about the LBO market . </s>
<s> And by late Friday afternoon , actually after the close , we decided that was the wrong tone to take . </s>
<s> With the market down , we wanted to tell people to put their orders in on the opening . '' </s>
<s> Both before and after the Friday plunge , Shearson has maintained a recommended portfolio weighting of 65 % stocks , 20 % bonds and 15 % cash . </s>
