<s> For Vietnamese , these are tricky , often treacherous , times . </s>
<s> After years of hesitation , economic and political reform was embraced at the end of 1986 , but ringing declarations have yet to be translated into much action . </s>
<s> Vietnam is finding that turning a stagnant socialist order into a dynamic free market does n't come easy . </s>
<s> Here is how three Vietnamese are coping with change : </s>
<s> The Tire King </s>
<s> Nguyen Van Chan is living proof that old ways die hard . </s>
<s> Mr. Chan used to be an oddity in Hanoi : a private entrepreneur . </s>
<s> His business success made him an official target in pre-reform days . </s>
<s> Mr. Chan , now 64 years old , invented a fountain pen he and his family produced from plastic waste . </s>
<s> Later , he marketed glue . </s>
<s> Both products were immensely popular . </s>
<s> For his troubles , Mr. Chan was jailed three times between 1960 and 1974 . </s>
<s> Though his operation was registered and used only scrap , he was accused of conducting illegal business and possessing illegal materials . </s>
<s> Once he was held for three months without being charged . </s>
<s> Things were supposed to change when Vietnam 's economic reforms gathered pace , and for awhile they did . </s>
<s> After years of experimenting , Mr. Chan produced a heavy-duty bicycle tire that outlasted its state-produced rival . </s>
<s> By 1982 , he was selling thousands of tires . </s>
<s> Newspapers published articles about him , and he was hailed as `` the tire king . '' </s>
<s> His efforts earned a gold medal at a national exhibition -- and attracted renewed attention from local authorities . </s>
<s> District police in 1983 descended on his suburban home , which he and his large family used as both residence and factory , and demanded proof the house and equipment were his . </s>
<s> He produced it . </s>
<s> `` That was the first time they lost and I won , '' he says . </s>
<s> He was further questioned to determine if he was `` a real working man or an exploiter . '' </s>
<s> Says Mr. Chan : `` When I showed it was from my own brain , they lost for the second time . '' </s>
<s> But a few days later the police accused him of stealing electricity , acquiring rubber without permission and buying stolen property . </s>
<s> Warned he was to be jailed again , he fled to the countryside . </s>
<s> His family was given three hours to leave before the house and contents were confiscated . </s>
<s> With only the clothes they were wearing , family members moved to a home owned by one of Mr. Chan 's sons . </s>
<s> After six months on the run , Mr. Chan learned the order for his arrest had been canceled . </s>
<s> He rejoined his family in January 1984 and began the long struggle for justice , pressing everyone from Hanoi municipal officials to National Assembly deputies for restoration of his rights . </s>
<s> He and his family kept afloat by repairing bicycles , selling fruit and doing odd jobs . </s>
<s> Mr. Chan achieved a breakthrough in 1987 -- and became a minor celebrity again -- when his story was published in a weekly newspaper . </s>
<s> In 1988 , 18 months after the sixth congress formally endorsed family-run private enterprise , district authorities allowed Mr. Chan to resume work . </s>
<s> By late last year he was invited back as `` the tire king '' to display his products at a national exhibition . </s>
<s> National leaders stopped by his stand to commend his achievements . </s>
<s> Mr. Chan now produces 1,000 bicycle and motorbike tires a month and 1,000 tins of tire-patching glue in the son 's small house . </s>
<s> Eighteen people pack the house 's two rooms -- the Chans , four of their 10 children with spouses , and eight of 22 grandchildren . </s>
<s> Most sleep on the floor . </s>
<s> Come daybreak , eight family members and two other workers unroll a sheet of raw rubber that covers the floor of the house and spills out onto the street . </s>
<s> The primitive operations also burst out the back door into a small courtyard , where an ancient press squeezes rubber solution into a flat strip and newly made tires are cooled in a bathtub filled with water . </s>
<s> Mr. Chan talks optimistically of expanding , maybe even moving into the import-export field . </s>
<s> First , however , he has unfinished business . </s>
<s> When district authorities allowed him to resume manufacturing , they released only one of his machines . </s>
<s> They did n't return the rubber stocks that represent his capital . </s>
<s> Nor did they return his house and contents , which he values at about $ 44,000 . </s>
<s> He wants to recover more than just his property , though . </s>
<s> `` I want my dignity back , '' he says . </s>
<s> The Editor </s>
<s> Nguyen Ngoc seemed an obvious choice when the Vietnamese Writers Association was looking for a new editor to reform its weekly newspaper , Van Nghe . </s>
<s> After the sixth congress , journalists seized the opportunity provided by the liberalization to probe previously taboo subjects . </s>
<s> Mr. Ngoc , 57 years old , had solid reformist credentials : He had lost his official position in the association in he early 1980s because he questioned the intrusion of politics into literature . </s>
<s> Appointed editor in chief in July 1987 , Mr. Ngoc rapidly turned the staid Van Nghe into Vietnam 's hottest paper . </s>
<s> Circulation soared as the weekly went way beyond standard literary themes to cover Vietnamese society and its ills . </s>
<s> Readers were electrified by the paper 's audacity and appalled by the dark side of life it uncovered . </s>
<s> One article recounted a decade-long struggle by a wounded soldier to prove , officially , he was alive . </s>
<s> Another described how tax-collection officials in Thanh Hoa province one night stormed through homes and confiscated rice from starving villagers . </s>
<s> The newspaper also ran a series of controversial short stories by Nguyen Huy Thiep , a former history teacher , who stirred debate over his interpretation of Vietnamese culture and took a thinly veiled swipe at writers who had blocked his entry into their official association . </s>
<s> Van Nghe quickly made influential enemies . </s>
<s> `` Those who manage ideology and a large number of writers reacted badly '' to the restyled paper , says Lai Nguyen An , a literary critic . </s>
<s> After months of internal rumblings , Mr. Ngoc was fired last December . </s>
<s> His dismissal triggered a furor among intellectuals that continues today . </s>
<s> `` Under Mr. Ngoc , Van Nghe protected the people instead of the government , '' says Nguyen Duy , a poet who is the paper 's bureau chief for southern Vietnam . </s>
<s> `` The paper reflected the truth . </s>
<s> For the leadership , that was too painful to bear . '' </s>
<s> The ` Billionaire ' </s>
<s> Nguyen Thi Thi is Vietnam 's entrepreneur of the 1980s . </s>
<s> Her challenge is to keep her fledgling empire on top in the 1990s . </s>
<s> Mrs. Thi did n't wait for the reforms to get her start . </s>
<s> She charged ahead of the government and the law to establish Hochiminh City Food Co. as the biggest rice dealer in the country . </s>
<s> Her success , which included alleviating an urban food shortage in the early 1980s , helped persuade Hanoi to take the reform path . </s>
<s> Her story is becoming part of local folklore . </s>
<s> A lifelong revolutionary with little education who fought both the French and the U.S.-backed Saigon regime , she switched effortlessly to commerce after the war . </s>
<s> Her instincts were capitalistic , despite her background . </s>
<s> As she rode over regulations , only her friendship with party leaders , including Nguyen Van Linh , then Ho Chi Minh City party secretary , kept her out of jail . </s>
<s> Following Mr. Linh 's appointment as secretary-general of the party at the sixth congress , Mrs. Thi has become the darling of `` doi moi '' , the Vietnamese version of perestroika . </s>
<s> The authorities have steered foreign reporters to her office to see an example of `` the new way of thinking . '' </s>
<s> Foreign publications have responded with articles declaring her Vietnam 's richest woman . </s>
<s> `` Some people call me the communist billionaire , '' she has told visitors . </s>
<s> Actually , 67-year-old Mrs. Thi is about as poor as almost everyone else in this impoverished land . </s>
<s> She has indeed turned Hochiminh City Food into a budding conglomerate , but the company itself remains state-owned . </s>
<s> She manages it with the title of general-director . </s>
<s> The heart of the business is the purchase of rice and other commodities , such as corn and coffee , from farmers in the south , paying with fertilizer , farm tools and other items . </s>
<s> Last year , Hochiminh City Food says it bought two million metric tons of unhusked rice , more than 10 % of the country 's output . </s>
<s> The company operates a fleet of trucks and boats to transport the commodities to its warehouses . </s>
<s> A subsidiary company processes commodities into foods such as instant noodles that are sold with the rice through a vast retail network . </s>
<s> In recent years , Mrs. Thi has started to diversify the company , taking a 20 % stake in newly established , partly private Industrial and Commercial Bank , and setting up Saigon Petro , which owns and operates Vietnam 's first oil refinery . </s>
<s> Mrs. Thi says Hochiminh City Food last year increased pretax profit 60 % to the equivalent of about $ 2.7 million on sales of $ 150 million . </s>
<s> She expects both revenue and profit to gain this year . </s>
<s> She is almost cavalier about the possibility Vietnam 's reforms will create rivals on her home turf . </s>
<s> `` I do n't mind the competition inside the country , '' she says . </s>
<s> `` I am only afraid that with Vietnam 's poor-quality products we ca n't compete with neighboring countries . </s>
