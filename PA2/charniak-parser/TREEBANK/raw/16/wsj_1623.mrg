<s> NOW YOU SEE IT , now you do n't . </s>
<s> The recession , that is . </s>
<s> The economy 's stutter steps leave investors wondering whether things are slowing down or speeding up . </s>
<s> So often are government statistics revised that they seem to resemble a spinning weather vane . </s>
<s> For the past seven years , investors have had the wind at their backs , in the form of a generally growing economy . </s>
<s> Some may have forgotten -- and some younger ones may never have experienced -- what it 's like to invest during a recession . </s>
<s> Different tactics are called for , as losing money becomes easier and making money becomes tougher . </s>
<s> For those investors who believe -- or fear -- that 1990 will be a recession year , many economists and money managers agree on steps that can be taken to lower the risks in a portfolio . </s>
<s> In a nutshell , pros advise investors who expect a slowdown to hold fewer stocks than usual and to favor shares of big companies in `` defensive '' industries . </s>
<s> A heavy dose of cash is prescribed , along with a heavier-than-usual allotment to bonds -- preferably government bonds . </s>
<s> It 's tempting to think these defensive steps can be delayed until a recession is clearly at hand . </s>
<s> But that may not be possible , because recessions often take investors by surprise . </s>
<s> `` They always seem to come a bit later than you expect . </s>
<s> When they do hit , they hit fast , '' says David A. Wyss , chief financial economist at the Data Resources division of McGraw-Hill Inc . </s>
<s> Though he himself does n't expect a recession soon , Mr. Wyss advises people who do that `` the best thing to be in is long that is , 20-year to 30-year Treasury bonds . '' </s>
<s> The reason is simple , Mr. Wyss says : `` Interest rates almost always decline during recession . '' </s>
<s> As surely as a seesaw tilts , falling interest rates force up the price of previously issued bonds . </s>
<s> They are worth more because they pay higher interest than newly issued bonds do . </s>
<s> That effect holds true for both short-term and long-term bonds . </s>
<s> But short-term bonds ca n't rise too much , because everyone knows they will be redeemed at a preset price fairly soon . </s>
<s> Long-term bonds , with many years left before maturity , swing more widely in price . </s>
<s> But not just any bonds will do . </s>
<s> Corporate bonds `` are usually not a good bet in a recession , '' Mr. Wyss says . </s>
<s> As times get tougher , investors fret about whether companies will have enough money to pay their debts . </s>
<s> This hurts the price of corporate bonds . </s>
<s> Also , he notes , `` most corporate bonds are callable . '' </s>
<s> That means that a corporation , after a specified amount of time has passed , can buy back its bonds by paying investors the face value -LRB- plus , in some cases , a sweetener -RRB- . </s>
<s> When interest rates have dropped , it makes sense for corporations to do just that ; they then save on interest costs . </s>
<s> But the investors are left stranded with money to reinvest at a time when interest rates are puny . </s>
<s> If corporate bonds are bad in recessions , junk bonds are likely to be the worst of all . </s>
<s> It 's an `` absolute necessity '' to get out of junk bonds when a recession is in the offing , says Avner Arbel , professor of finance at Cornell University . </s>
<s> `` Such bonds are very sensitive to the downside , and this could be a disaster . '' </s>
<s> Municipal bonds are generally a bit safer than corporate bonds in a recession , but not as safe as bonds issued by the federal government . </s>
<s> During an economic slump , local tax revenues often go down , raising the risks associated with at least some municipals . </s>
<s> And , like corporates , many municipal bonds are callable . </s>
<s> But a few experts , going against the consensus , do n't think bonds would help investors even if a recession is in the offing . </s>
<s> One of these is Jeffrey L. Beach , director of research for Underwood Neuhaus & Co. , a brokerage house in Houston , who thinks that `` we 're either in a recession or about to go into one . '' </s>
<s> What 's more , he thinks this could be a nastier recession than usual : `` Once the downturn comes , it 's going to be very hard to reverse . '' </s>
<s> Investors , he advises , `` should be cautious , '' holding fewer stocks than usual and also shunning bonds . </s>
<s> Because he sees a `` 5 % to 6 % base rate of inflation in the economy , '' he doubts that interest rates will fall much any time soon . </s>
<s> Instead , Mr. Beach says , investors `` probably should be carrying a very high level of cash , '' by which he means such so-called cash equivalents as money-market funds and Treasury bills . </s>
<s> Greg Confair , president of Sigma Financial Inc. in Allentown , Pa. , also recommends that investors go heavily for cash . </s>
<s> He is n't sure a recession is coming , but says the other likely alternative -- reignited inflation -- is just as bad . </s>
<s> `` This late in an expansion , '' the economy tends to veer off either into damaging inflation or into a recession , Mr. Confair says . </s>
<s> The Federal Reserve Board 's plan for a `` soft landing , '' he says , requires the Fed to navigate `` an ever-narrowing corridor . '' </s>
<s> A soft landing is n't something that can be achieved once and for all , Mr. Confair adds . </s>
<s> It has to be engineered over and over again , month after month . </s>
<s> He believes that the task facing Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is so difficult that it resembles `` juggling a double-bladed ax and a buzz saw . '' </s>
<s> And , in a sense , that 's the kind of task individuals face in deciding what to do about stocks -- the mainstay of most serious investors ' portfolios . </s>
<s> It comes down to a question of whether to try to `` time '' the market . </s>
<s> For people who can ride out market waves through good times and bad , stocks have been rewarding long-term investments . </s>
<s> Most studies show that buy-and-hold investors historically have earned an annual return from stocks of 9 % to 10 % , including both dividends and price appreciation . </s>
<s> That 's well above what bonds or bank certificates have paid . </s>
<s> Moreover , because no one knows for sure just when a recession is coming , some analysts think investors should n't even worry too much about timing . </s>
<s> `` Trying to time the economy is a mistake , '' says David Katz , chief investment officer of Value Matrix Management Inc. in New York . </s>
<s> Mr. Katz notes that some economists have been predicting a recession for at least two years . </s>
<s> Investors who listened , and lightened up on stocks , `` have just hurt themselves , '' he says . </s>
<s> Mr. Katz adds that people who jump in and out of the stock market need to be right about 70 % of the time to beat a buy-and-hold strategy . </s>
<s> Frequent trading runs up high commission costs . </s>
<s> And the in-and-outer might miss the sudden spurts that account for much of the stock market 's gains over time . </s>
<s> Still , few investors are able to sit tight when they are convinced a recession is coming . </s>
<s> After all , in all five recessions since 1960 , stocks declined . </s>
<s> According to Ned Davis , president of Ned Davis Research Inc. in Nokomis , Fla. , the average drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average was about 21 % , and the decrease began an average of six months before a recession officially started . </s>
<s> By the time a recession is `` official '' -LRB- two consecutive quarters of declining gross national product -RRB- , much of the damage to stocks has already been done - and , in the typical case , the recession is already half over . </s>
<s> About six months before a recession ends , stocks typically begin to rise again , as investors anticipate a recovery . </s>
<s> The average recession lasts about a year . </s>
<s> Unfortunately , though , recessions vary enough in length so that the average ca n't reliably be used to guide investors in timing stock sales or purchases . </s>
<s> But whatever their advice about timing , none of these experts recommend jettisoning stocks entirely during a recession . </s>
<s> For the portion of an investor 's portfolio that stays in stocks , professionals have a number of suggestions . </s>
<s> Mr. Katz advocates issues with low price-earnings ratios -- that is , low prices in relation to the company 's earnings per share . </s>
<s> `` Low P-E '' stocks , he says , vastly outperform others `` during a recession or bear market . '' </s>
<s> In good times , he says , they lag a bit , but overall they provide superior performance . </s>
<s> Prof. Arbel urges investors to discard stocks in small companies . </s>
<s> Small-company shares typically fall more than big-company stocks in a recession , he says . </s>
<s> And in any case , he argues , stocks of small companies are `` almost as overpriced as they were Sept. 30 , 1987 , just before the crash . '' </s>
<s> For example , Mr. Arbel says , stocks of small companies are selling for about 19 times cash flow . </s>
<s> -LRB- Cash flow , basically earnings plus depreciation , is one common gauge of a company 's financial health . -RRB- </s>
<s> That ratio is dangerously close to the ratio of 19.7 that prevailed before the 1987 stock-market crash , Mr. Arbel says . </s>
<s> And it 's way above the ratio -LRB- 7.5 times cash flow -RRB- that bigger companies are selling for . </s>
<s> Another major trick in making a portfolio recession-resistant is choosing stocks in `` defensive '' industries . </s>
<s> Food , tobacco , drugs and utilities are the classic examples . </s>
<s> Recession or not , people still eat , smoke , and take medicine when they 're sick . </s>
<s> George Putnam III , editor of Turnaround Letter in Boston , offers one final tip for recession-wary investors . </s>
<s> `` Keep some money available for opportunities , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` If the recession does hit , there will be some great investment opportunities just when things seem the blackest . '' </s>
