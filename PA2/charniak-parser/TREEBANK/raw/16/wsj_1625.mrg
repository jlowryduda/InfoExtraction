<s> THE PANHANDLER approaches , makes his pitch . </s>
<s> It may be straightforward -- he wants money for food -- or incredibly convoluted ; his sister is at this very moment near death in Hoboken , he has lost his wallet and has only $ 1.22 in change to put toward a bus ticket costing $ 3.83 , and wo n't you give him the difference ? </s>
<s> No ? </s>
<s> Well , how about a loan , he 'll take your name and address ... </s>
<s> Figuring that their money would more likely go toward a bottle of Night Train Express , most people have little trouble saying no to propositions like this . </s>
<s> But healthy skepticism vanishes when they are solicited by an organized charity to help fight cancer , famine , child abuse , or what have you . </s>
<s> Most see little reason to doubt that their cash will go toward these noble goals . </s>
<s> But will it ? </s>
<s> In a distressing number of cases , no . </s>
<s> In fact , the donors sometimes might be better off giving the money to the panhandler : at least he has no overhead , and he might even be telling the truth . </s>
<s> Last year , more than $ 100 billion was donated to the nation 's 400,000 charities . </s>
<s> While the vast bulk of it was indeed spent by reputable organizations on the good works it was raised for , it 's equally true that a sizable hunk was consumed in `` expenses '' claimed by other operators , including fraudulent expenses . </s>
<s> In many cases the costs claimed were so high that only a dribble of cash was left for the purported beneficiaries . </s>
<s> It 's impossible to say exactly how much of the total charity intake is devoured by stratospheric fund-raising costs , high-living operators , and downright fraud . </s>
<s> But the problem clearly is widespread and persistent . </s>
<s> State law enforcers can barely keep up with charity scams , and reports from watchdog groups such as the Council of Better Business Bureaus are not encouraging . </s>
<s> The Philanthropic Advisory Service of the BBB reviews hundreds of new charities every year , measuring them against minimum standards for accountability ; for accuracy and honesty in solicitation ; and for percentage of funds actually going to work for which the charity was supposedly established . </s>
<s> The Service figures at least half of the money taken in should be spent on program . </s>
<s> Roughly a third of the charities reviewed flunk the test . </s>
<s> Which , it should be added , does n't prevent the charities from raking in a lot of money anyway . </s>
<s> Without a microscope and a subpoena , it 's often hard to sort out worthwhile causes from ripoffs if all you 've got to go on is the solicitation itself . </s>
<s> On this basis , `` there 's no way the average person can know a good charity from a bad one , '' says David Ormstedt , an assistant attorney general in Connecticut . </s>
<s> `` A lot of donors just get taken . '' </s>
<s> Including those , he contends , who put about $ 1 million into the kitty for the Connecticut Association of Concerned Veterans and the Vietnam Veterans Service Center . </s>
<s> The state has sued these charities in state court , complaining that much of the money was grossly misspent ; 82 % , says Mr. Ormstedt , went to fund raisers and most of the rest to the people who ran the charities and to their relatives -- for fur coats , trips to Florida , Lucullan restaurant tabs . </s>
<s> The telephone number for the charity in Shelton , Conn. , has been disconnected , and the former officials could n't be located . </s>
<s> Running a charity does cost money , but reputable organizations manage to get the lion 's share of donations out to where they are really needed . </s>
<s> The Arthritis Foundation , the American Cancer Society and the United Way of America all say that they spend roughly 90 % of their income on programs , not overhead . </s>
<s> With some other charities , however , it s the other way around . </s>
<s> The fledgling National Children 's Cancer Society , for example , took in $ 2.5 million last year to finance bone-marrow transplants for children . </s>
<s> By the time it paid its expenses it only had $ 120,000 left -- not enough to treat even one child . </s>
<s> The state of Illinois is suing the charity for fraud in Chicago , along with Telesystems Marketing Inc. , its Houston-based fund raiser . </s>
<s> Both deny wrongdoing . </s>
<s> The charity admits spending a lot on fund raising , but says that was necessary to establish a donor base it can tap at much lower cost in years to come . </s>
<s> Michael Burns , president of Telesystems , says his concern has only benefited from the publicity surrounding the case , noting that three other charities have signed on as clients because they were impressed with the amount he raised for National Children 's . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , a state court judge has allowed the charity to go on soliciting funds . </s>
<s> Enforcers ca n't put charities out of business simply because they spend the lion 's share of their income on fund raising . </s>
<s> State laws previously used as a yardstick minimum percentages of income -- usually half -- that had to be spent on the program rather than overhead , but these have been overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court . </s>
<s> It has ruled that such laws might work to stifle fund raising , which would amount to limiting the charities ' first-amendment right to freedom of expression . </s>
<s> This puts upon enforcers the burden of proving outright fraud or misrepresentation , and such actions have been brought against hundreds of charities recently . </s>
<s> The attorney general 's office in Connecticut alone has put seven of them out of business over the past couple of years , and the enforcement drive is continuing there and elsewhere . </s>
<s> In making cases , the authorities frequently zero in on alleged misrepresentations made by the charities ' fund raisers . </s>
<s> Illinois , for instance , currently has under investigation 10 of the 30 companies drumming up funds for charities soliciting there . </s>
<s> Enforcers pay special attention to operators using sweepstakes prizes as an additional inducement to give . </s>
<s> Attorneys general in several states , including Illinois , are already suing Watson & Hughey Co. , an Alexandria , Va.-based outfit that they say has used deceptive sweepstakes ads to solicit donations for the American Heart Disease Foundation and the Cancer Fund of America . </s>
<s> According to the Illinois attorney general 's suit , Watson & Hughey sent mailings indicating that recipients were guaranteed cash prizes , and could win up to an additional $ 1,000 on top of them , if they contributed as little as $ 7 . </s>
<s> But the total value of the prizes was only $ 5,000 and most `` winners '' will receive just 10 cents , according to the attorney general 's office . </s>
<s> The suit is still pending in Illinois state court . </s>
<s> Watson & Hughey has denied the allegations in court ; officials decline to comment further . </s>
<s> While they can target some of the most obvious miscreants , enforcers concede that they are only scratching the surface . </s>
<s> There are so many cunning ploys used by so many dubious operators , they say , that it is probably impossible to stop them all . </s>
<s> One maneuver : the `` public education '' gambit . </s>
<s> The solicitation material indicates that donations will go toward a campaign alerting and informing the public about some health or other issue . </s>
<s> What it does n't say is that the entire `` campaign '' may be the fund-raising letter itself . </s>
<s> `` All too often this will merely be a statement on the solicitation such as , ` Do n't smoke ! ' or ` Wear suntan lotion , ' `` says William Webster , attorney general of Missouri . </s>
<s> `` By putting these pithy statements on the solicitations , hundreds of thousands of dollars are claimed to have been spent on education to consumers when in fact this represents the costs of sending the newsletters . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Webster cites a four-page mailing from the United Cancer Council that offers a chance to win $ 5,000 in gold bullion to those giving as little as $ 5 to cancer education . </s>
<s> `` A few boilerplate warnings about cancer appear but that 's only two inches in all four pages . </s>
<s> I think some people may believe they 're helping fund a massive TV and print campaign , but we could n't find that the charity does anything except write these letters , '' he says . </s>
<s> Officials at the Washington D.C.-based charity did n't return repeated phone calls . </s>
<s> Many fly-by-night charities ride the coattails of the biggest , best-known and most reputable ones by adopting names similar to theirs . </s>
<s> The established charities are bothered by this but say they can do little about it . </s>
<s> `` We ca n't police the many organizations that have sprung up in the last few years using part of our name . </s>
<s> Most of them do n't last for long , but in the meantime all we can do is tell people they are n't connected with us , '' says a spokeswoman for the American Heart Association . </s>
<s> And sometimes a reputable charity with a household name gets used and does n't even know it . </s>
<s> A couple in Rockford , Ill. , raised $ 12,591 earlier this year using the name and logo of Mothers Against Drunk Driving , without permission from the group . </s>
<s> MADD did n't learn of the fund raising until the couple sent it a check for $ 613 , along with a letter saying that was the charity 's `` share . '' </s>
<s> The Illinois Attorney General won a court order to prevent the couple from raising further funds without MADD 's permission . </s>
<s> The couple could n't be reached for comment and apparently have left Rockford , law enforcement officials report . </s>
<s> Denise McDonald , a spokeswoman for MADD , says , `` It 's scary , because anybody could do this . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Johnson is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal 's Chicago bureau . </s>
<s> Overhead costs at some of the largest charities , in millions of dollars </s>
