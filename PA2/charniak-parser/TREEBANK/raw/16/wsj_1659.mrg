<s> The television units of Paramount Communications Inc. and MCA Inc. are exploring the possibility of offering prime-time programming to independent stations two nights a week , industry executives say . </s>
<s> Although such a venture would n't match the `` fourth network '' created by News Corp. 's Fox Broadcasting Co. , MCA and Paramount may have similar ambitions . </s>
<s> Fox , which also owns six TV stations , provides programs three nights a week to those and other affiliates . </s>
<s> Paramount Domestic TV and MCA TV formed a joint venture last month , named Premier Advertiser Sales , to sell advertising in programs syndicated by both companies , such as `` Star Trek : the Next Generation , '' `` Charles in Charge '' and `` Friday the 13th : the Series . '' </s>
<s> A spokeswoman for Paramount said the company does n't comment on speculation . </s>
<s> Calls to Shelly Schwab , president of MCA TV , were n't returned . </s>
<s> The two companies , like Fox , already have their own TV stations . </s>
<s> MCA owns WWOR in New York and Paramount last month agreed to purchase a 79 % stake in the TVX Broadcast Group from Salomon Inc. in a deal valued at $ 140 million . </s>
<s> TVX owns five stations , including WTXF , a Fox affiliate , in Philadelphia . </s>
<s> One broadcasting executive familiar with the project said the co-venture would target stations affiliated with Fox because Fox has the desirable independent stations in most of the key cities . </s>
<s> Currently , Fox supplies programs on Saturdays , Sundays and Mondays , although the company plans to expand to other weeknights . </s>
<s> Jamie Kellner , president of Fox Broadcasting , said , `` We believe the partnership of Fox , its affiliates and advertisers is succeeding and will continue to grow . '' </s>
<s> Another Fox official , who declined to be identified , said Fox was n't pleased by the possible Paramount-MCA venture into prime-time programming . </s>
<s> `` To make the venture work , they would need Fox affiliates , '' he said . </s>
<s> `` We spent a lot of time and money in building our group of stations , '' he said , adding that Fox does n't `` appreciate '' another company attempting to usurp its station lineup . </s>
<s> Fox said it plans to offer its stations movies , theatrical and made-for-TV ventures , probably on Wednesdays , sometime next year . </s>
<s> It is also planning another night of original series . </s>
<s> Paramount and MCA , according to the broadcasting executive , plan to offer theatrical movies produced separately by Paramount and MCA for Wednesdays and perhaps a block of original shows Fridays . </s>
<s> The executive said Paramount and MCA have also held discussions with Chris-Craft Industries ' broadcasting unit , which owns five independent stations in cities such as Los Angeles , San Francisco and Portland , Ore . </s>
<s> A Chris-Craft station manager said there have been no formal talks . </s>
<s> `` I think it 's to Fox 's advantage to be associated with the Paramount-MCA venture , '' said Michael Conway , station manager of WTXF , the TVX station that is a Fox affiliate . </s>
<s> Mr. Conway said the Fox shows appearing on nights when Paramount-MCA shows would n't be offered could be promoted on the programs produced by Paramount-MCA . </s>
<s> Michael Fisher , general manager of KTXL , a Fox affiliate in Sacramento , Calif. , said , `` The real question is whether the Paramount-MCA offering is practical . </s>
<s> It is n't ... . </s>
<s> Why would I consider giving up Fox , a proven commodity , '' for an unknown venture ? </s>
<s> Fox attracts a young audience with shows such as `` Married ... With Children , '' its most successful series . </s>
