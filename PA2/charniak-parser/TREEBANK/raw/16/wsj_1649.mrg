<s> Raymond Chandler , in a 1950 letter defending a weak Hemingway book , likened a champion writer to a baseball pitcher . </s>
<s> When the champ has lost his stuff , the great mystery novelist wrote , `` when he can no longer throw the high hard one , he throws his heart instead . </s>
<s> He throws something . </s>
<s> He does n't just walk off the mound and weep . '' </s>
<s> Chandler might have been predicting the course of his own career . </s>
<s> His last published novel featuring private detective Philip Marlowe , the inferior `` Playback '' -LRB- 1958 -RRB- , at times read almost like a parody of his previous work . </s>
<s> When he died in 1959 , Chandler left behind four chapters of yet another Marlowe book , `` The Poodle Springs Story , '' which seemed to go beyond parody into something like burlesque . </s>
<s> `` Champ '' Chandler 's last pitch , apparently , was a screwball . </s>
<s> Now Robert Parker , author of several best sellers featuring Spenser , a contemporary private eye in the Marlowe mold , has with the blessings of the Chandler estate been hired to complete `` The Poodle Springs Story . '' </s>
<s> The result , `` Poodle Springs '' -LRB- Putnam 's , 288 pages , $ 18.95 -RRB- is an entertaining , easy to read and fairly graceful extension of the Marlowe chronicle , full of hard-boiled wisecracks and California color . </s>
<s> If it does not quite have Chandler 's special magic -- well , at the end , neither did Chandler . </s>
<s> As the book begins , a newly wed Marlowe roars into the desert resort of Poodle -LRB- a.k.a . Palm -RRB- Springs at the wheel of a Cadillac Fleetwood . </s>
<s> His bride is the rich and beautiful Linda Loring , a character who also appeared in Chandler 's `` The Long Goodbye '' and `` Playback . '' </s>
<s> Philip and Linda move into her mansion and ca n't keep their hands off each other , even in front of the Hawaiian\/Japanese houseman . </s>
<s> But the lovebirds have a conflict . </s>
<s> He wants to continue being a low-paid private eye , and she wants him to live off the million dollars she 's settled on him . </s>
<s> That 's Chandler 's setup . </s>
<s> Mr. Parker spins it into a pretty satisfying tale involving Poodle Springs high life , Hollywood low life and various folk who hang their hats in both worlds . </s>
<s> The supporting lineup is solid , the patter is amusing and there 's even a cameo by Bernie Ohls , the `` good cop '' of previous Chandler books who still does n't hesitate to have Marlowe jailed when it suits his purposes . </s>
<s> The style throughout bears a strong resemblance to Chandler 's prose at its most pared down . </s>
<s> All told , Mr. Parker does a better job of making a novel out of this abandoned fragment than anyone might have had a right to expect . </s>
<s> But there are grounds for complaint . </s>
<s> At one point , the reader is two steps ahead of Marlowe in catching on to a double identity scam -- and Marlowe is supposed to be the pro . </s>
<s> More bothersome , there are several apparent anachronisms . </s>
<s> Contact lenses , tank tops , prostitutes openly working the streets of Hollywood and the Tequila Sunrise cocktail all seem out of place in the 1950s . </s>
<s> A little more care in re-creating Marlowe 's universe would have made the book that much more enjoyable . </s>
