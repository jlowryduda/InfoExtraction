<s> The 1986 tax overhaul , the biggest achievement of President Reagan 's second term , is beginning to fall apart , and interest groups are lining up for tax goodies all over Capitol Hill . </s>
<s> Real-estate executives are lobbying to ease anti-tax-shelter rules . </s>
<s> Charitable groups are trying to reinstate the write-off for contributions made by individuals who do n't itemize their deductions . </s>
<s> Big auction houses want to make collectibles eligible for lower capital-gains taxes . </s>
<s> And heavy-industry lobbyists are quietly discussing the possibility of reinstating the investment tax credit . </s>
<s> `` Everything is up for grabs , '' says Theodore Groom , a lobbyist for mutual life-insurance companies . </s>
<s> Adds Robert Juliano , the head lobbyist for a variety of interests that want to protect the tax deduction for travel and entertainment expenses : `` It appears as though the whole thing is wide open again . '' </s>
<s> The catalyst has been the congressional move to restore preferential tax treatment for capital gains , an effort that is likely to succeed in this Congress . </s>
<s> Other fundamental `` reforms '' of the 1986 act have been threatened as well . </s>
<s> The House seriously considered raising the top tax rate paid by individuals with the highest incomes . </s>
<s> The Senate Finance Committee voted to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts , and also to bring back income averaging for farmers , a tax preference that allows income to be spread out over several years . </s>
<s> As part of the same bill , the finance panel also voted in favor of billions of dollars in narrow tax breaks for individuals and corporations , in what committee member Sen. David Pryor -LRB- D. , Ark . -RRB- calls a `` feeding frenzy '' of special-interest legislating . </s>
<s> The beneficiaries would range from pineapple growers to rich grandparents to tuxedo-rental shops . </s>
<s> To be sure , the full Senate , facing a fast-approaching budget deadline , last Friday stripped away all of the tax breaks that were contained in the Finance Committee bill . </s>
<s> But lawmakers of both parties agree that the streamlining was temporary . </s>
<s> Other bills will be moving soon that are expected to carry many of the tax cuts , including both the capital-gains and IRA provisions . </s>
<s> `` There is n't any doubt that the thread of the '86 code has been given a mighty tug , '' says Rep. Thomas Downey -LRB- D. , N.Y . -RRB- . </s>
<s> `` You 'll see the annual unraveling of it . '' </s>
<s> `` It 's back to tax-give-away time for the select few , '' says Rep. William Gray of Pennsylvania , the third-ranking Democrat in the House . </s>
<s> Referring to the chairmen of the Senate and House tax-writing committees , he adds , `` Next year , every special-interest group is going to be there knocking on Lloyd Bentsen 's door , on Danny Rostenkowski 's door . '' </s>
<s> Many groups are n't waiting that long . </s>
<s> Just last week , a House Ways and Means subcommittee held a lengthy meeting to hear the pleas of individual cities , companies and interest groups who want to open their own special loopholes . </s>
<s> `` It 's a Swiss-cheese factory and the cheese smells pretty good , '' commented one veteran lobbyist who was watching the proceedings . </s>
<s> Even lobbyists for heavy industry , one of the interests hit hardest in the 1986 bill , are encouraged . </s>
<s> The return of pro-investment tax breaks such as those for capital gains and IRAs `` creates more of a mood or a mindset that is helpful for getting better depreciation -LRB- write-offs -RRB- or investment credits , '' says Paul Huard , a vice president for the National Association of Manufacturers . </s>
<s> Corporate lobbyist Charls Walker is planning a spring conference to discuss what tax changes to make to improve `` competitiveness . '' </s>
<s> In reaction to proposed capital-gains legislation , groups are lobbying to make sure they are n't left off the gravy train . </s>
<s> Real-estate interests , for example , are protesting an omission in President Bush 's capital-gains proposal : It does n't include real-estate gains . </s>
<s> `` If there is going to be a tax scheme that contemplates lower treatment of capital gains , they certainly want to be part of it , '' says real-estate lobbyist Wayne Thevenot of Concord Associates . </s>
<s> In the House-passed tax bill , Mr. Thevenot got his wish ; real-estate assets are included in the capital-gains provision . </s>
<s> But Sotheby 's , Christie 's and the National Association of Antique Dealers are still trying to get theirs . </s>
<s> They have sent a letter to congressional tax-writers asking that gains from the sale of collectibles also be given preferential treatment . </s>
<s> `` Collectibles should continue to be recognized as capital assets , '' the letter states . </s>
<s> All of this talk is antithetical to the Tax Reform Act of 1986 . </s>
<s> In exchange for dramatically lower tax rates , the framers of that legislation sought to eliminate most of the exemptions , deductions and credits that gave some taxpayers an advantage over others . </s>
<s> The goal was to tax people with roughly equivalent incomes equally , and to eliminate the many shelters that allowed the wealthy to escape taxes . </s>
<s> Two of the major ways that tax-writers managed to attain these ends were to scrap the preferential treatment of capital gains and to curtail the use of paper losses , also known as passive losses , that made many tax shelters possible . </s>
<s> Many other tax benefits also were swept away . </s>
<s> This year Congress , with prodding from President Bush , has been busy trying to put many of these same tax preferences back into the code . </s>
<s> It appears likely that , this year or next , some form of capital-gains preference and passive-loss restoration will be enacted . </s>
<s> Other tax benefits probably will be restored and created . </s>
<s> The main obstacle is finding a way to pay for them . </s>
<s> `` The '86 act was a fluke . </s>
<s> They wanted reform and they got a revolution , '' says overhaul advocate Rep. Willis Gradison -LRB- R. , Ohio -RRB- . </s>
<s> So , is the tax code now open game again ? </s>
<s> Mr. Juliano thinks so . </s>
<s> One recent Saturday morning he stayed inside the Capitol monitoring tax-and-budget talks instead of flying to San Francisco for a fund-raiser and then to his hometown of Chicago for the 30th reunion of St. Ignatius High School . </s>
<s> `` I 'm too old to waste a weekend , but that 's what I did , '' the 48-year-old Mr. Juliano moans . </s>
<s> `` These days , anything can happen . </s>
