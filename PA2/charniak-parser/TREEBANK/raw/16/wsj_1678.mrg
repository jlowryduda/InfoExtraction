<s> Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. lost its second recent arbitration case involving a former bond-trading executive . </s>
<s> A New York Stock Exchange arbitration panel ordered Dean Witter to pay $ 404,294 in back bonuses to William Kelly , the company 's former head of high-yield , high-risk junk-bond trading and sales . </s>
<s> It also awarded $ 196,785 in back bonuses to former trader Michael Newcomb and $ 69,105 in fees to the two men 's attorneys . </s>
<s> The sums awarded to Messrs. Kelly and Newcomb represent bonuses the two men said they deserved from the first half of 1988 , but which were n't paid because of a dispute over an incentive contract . </s>
<s> Jeffrey L. Liddle , the two men 's attorney at Liddle , O'Connor , Finkelstein & Robinson , said Mr. Kelly began working at Dean Witter in 1987 . </s>
<s> Mr. Kelly built the company 's high-yield bond group , which has been a minor player in the junk-bond arena . </s>
<s> Dean Witter lost a separate case involving a former bond executive earlier this year ; in August it paid $ 666,666 in back pay and a bonus to a former corporate-bond trading chief , Harold Bachman . </s>
<s> That award ended a dispute between Dean Witter and Mr. Bachman over who was responsible for certain bond-trading losses around the time of the 1987 stock-market crash . </s>
<s> A spokesman for Dean Witter , a unit of Sears , Roebuck & Co. , declined to comment . </s>
