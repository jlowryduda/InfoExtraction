<s> On June 30 , a major part of our trade deficit went poof ! </s>
<s> No figure juggling ; no witchcraft ; just vastly improved recording of some of our exports . </s>
<s> The result ? </s>
<s> The Commerce Department found that U.S. exports in 1988 , net of imports , were understated by $ 20.9 billion a year and understated at the annualized rate of $ 25.4 billion in the first quarter of 1989 . </s>
<s> More than half of the `` newly found '' net exports were from just a few service-sector categories . </s>
<s> Some of the biggest service-industry exporters -- American financial-service companies , for example -- have yet to be fully included in our export statistics . </s>
<s> Nearly 10 years ago , representatives of service-sector companies worked out a plan with the Commerce Department to improve the data on service-sector exports . </s>
<s> Both groups believed that tens of billions of dollars of service exports -- such as inbound tourism ; legal , accounting and other professional services furnished to foreigners ; financial , engineering and construction services ; and the like -- were not being counted as exports . </s>
<s> The monthly `` trade deficit '' figure is limited to traditional merchandise trade : manufactured goods and raw materials . </s>
<s> In the quarterly balance-of-payments report , those merchandise trade figures are merged with statistics on exports and imports of services , as well as returns on investments abroad by Americans and returns on foreign investments in the U.S. . </s>
<s> Over time , through benchmark surveys , the corrected data on service exports and imports have been gathered . </s>
<s> The first three major areas of the service sector to be revamped were expenditures by foreign students in the U.S. . -LRB- net after expenditures by Americans studying abroad -RRB- , some exports by professional firms -LRB- a law firm billing a German client for services rendered in watching legislation in Washington is as much an export as shipment of an American jet engine -RRB- , and improved data from travel and tourism . </s>
<s> In just these three areas , the Commerce Department found $ 23 billion more exports than previously reported and $ 11.6 billion more imports , with the net result that the U.S. service surplus in 1988 increased by $ 11.3 billion , to $ 19 billion . </s>
<s> Combined with recalculations and revisions in other trade areas , the value of U.S. net exports that had not previously been recorded was about $ 20 billion a year . </s>
<s> That means that the U.S. trade deficit was running closer to $ 75 billion than to $ 95 billion in 1988 , and $ 55 billion -LRB- annualized -RRB- rather than $ 80 billion in the first quarter of 1989 . </s>
<s> These revised figures also may explain some of the recent strength of the dollar . </s>
<s> The materially smaller trade deficit may have been already discounted in the market . </s>
<s> What does this mean for trade policy ? </s>
<s> Too early to tell , but a trade deficit that is significantly smaller than we imagined does suggest a review of our trade posture . </s>
<s> It does not relieve the need for our market-opening efforts for both goods and services , but it does suggest that it is our exports of services , and not just borrowing , that is financing our imports of goods . </s>
