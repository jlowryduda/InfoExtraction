<s> Many investors give Michael Foods about as much chance of getting it together as Humpty Dumpty . </s>
<s> But now at least there 's a glimmer of hope for the stock . </s>
<s> Burger King , which breaks thousands of fresh eggs each morning , is quietly switching over to an alternative egg product made by Michael Foods . </s>
<s> Known as Easy Eggs , the product has disappointed investors . </s>
<s> When the company this month announced lower-than-forecast sales of Easy Eggs , the stock dropped nearly 19 % . </s>
<s> Michael wo n't confirm the identities of any Easy Egg customers , nor will it say much of anything else . </s>
<s> Two Minneapolis shareholder suits in the past month have accused top officers of making `` various untrue statements . '' </s>
<s> These federal-court suits accuse the officers of failing to disclose that Easy Eggs were unlikely to sell briskly enough to justify all of Michael 's production capacity . </s>
<s> But at least Burger King has signed on , and says that by year end it wo n't be using any shell eggs . </s>
<s> The Miami fast-food chain , owned by Grand Metropolitan of Britain , expects to consume roughly 34 million pounds of liquefied eggs annually . </s>
<s> So there is reason to believe that Michael 's hopes for a bacteria-free , long-shelf-life egg were n't all hype . </s>
<s> -LRB- Easy Eggs are pasteurized in a heat-using process . -RRB- </s>
<s> Still , caution is advisable . </s>
<s> A company official says Michael 's break-even volume on Easy Eggs is around 60 million pounds a year -- apparently well above current shipments and a far cry from what the company once suggested was a billion-pound market waiting for such a product . </s>
<s> Perhaps to debunk the analysts ' talk of over-capacity , Michael today will take some of the skeptics on a tour of its new Gaylord , Minn. , plant . </s>
<s> There has been no announcement of the Burger King arrangement by either party , possibly for fear that McDonald 's and other fast-food rivals would seize on it in scornful advertising . </s>
<s> But Burger King operators independently confirm using Michael 's product . </s>
<s> Other institutional users reportedly include Marriott , which is moving away from fresh eggs on a region-by-region basis . </s>
<s> The extent of Marriott 's use is n't known , and Marriott officials could n't be reached for comment . </s>
<s> Michael Foods has attracted a good many short-sellers , the people who sell borrowed shares in a bet that a stock price will drop and allow the return of cheaper shares to the lender . </s>
<s> Many analysts question management 's credibility . </s>
<s> `` The stock , in my opinion , is going to go lower , not only because of disappointing earnings but -LCB- because -RCB- the credibility gap is certainly not closing , '' says L. Craig Carver of Dain Bosworth . </s>
<s> Mr. Carver says that at a recent Dain-sponsored conference in New York , he asked Michael 's chief executive officer if the fourth quarter would be down . </s>
<s> The CEO , Richard G. Olson , replied `` yes , '' but would n't elaborate . </s>
<s> -LRB- The company did n't put out a public announcement . </s>
<s> A spokesman said later that Mr. Olson was being `` conservative '' in his estimate . </s>
<s> But the spokesman added that while Michael will earn less than last year 's $ 1.20 a share , it thinks Street estimates of $ 1 or so are low . -RRB- </s>
<s> Analyst Robin Young of John Kinnard & Co. , Minneapolis , calls himself `` the last remaining bull on the stock . '' </s>
<s> He argues that Michael Foods is misunderstood : `` This is a growth company in the packaged food industry -- a rare breed , like finding a white rhino . '' </s>
<s> Earnings are n't keeping pace , he says , because of heavy investments in the egg technologies and drought-related costs in its potato business . </s>
<s> Mr. Carver , however , believes the company 's egg product wo n't help the bottom line in the short run , even though it `` makes sense -- it 's more convenient '' and justifies its price , which is higher than shell eggs , because of health and sanitation concerns . </s>
<s> Prospective competition is one problem . </s>
<s> Last week a closely held New Jersey concern , Papetti High-Grade Egg Products Co. , rolled out an aseptically packaged liquefied item called Table Ready . </s>
<s> Company President Steve Papetti says Marriott will be among his clients as well . </s>
<s> Michael shares closed at 13 3\/4 yesterday in national over-the-counter trading . </s>
<s> Says New York-based short seller Mark Cohodes , `` In my mind this is a $ 7 stock . '' </s>
<s> Michael late yesterday announced a $ 3.8 million stock buy-back program . </s>
<s> Michael , which also processes potatoes , still relies on spuds for about a fourth of its sales and nearly half its pretax profit . </s>
<s> But dry growing conditions in the Red River Valley of Minnesota and North Dakota are pushing spot prices of potatoes beyond what Michael contracted to pay last spring . </s>
<s> Company lawyers recently sent letters to growers saying that Michael `` would take very seriously any effort ... to divert its contracted-for potatoes to other outlets . '' </s>
<s> Still , analysts believe that profit margins in the potato business will be down again this year . </s>
