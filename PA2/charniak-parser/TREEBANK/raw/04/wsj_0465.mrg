<s> Medical scientists are starting to uncover a handful of genes which , if damaged , unleash the chaotic growth of cells that characterizes cancer . </s>
<s> Scientists say the discovery of these genes in recent months is painting a new and startling picture of how cancer develops . </s>
<s> An emerging understanding of the genes is expected to produce an array of new strategies for future cancer treatment and prevention . </s>
<s> That is for the future . </s>
<s> Already , scientists are developing tests based on the newly identified genes that , for the first time , can predict whether an otherwise healthy individual is likely to get cancer . </s>
<s> `` It 's a super-exciting set of discoveries , '' says Bert Vogelstein , a Johns Hopkins University researcher who has just found a gene pivotal to the triggering of colon cancer . </s>
<s> `` Only a decade ago cancer was a black box about which we knew nothing at the molecular level . </s>
<s> Today , we know that the accumulation of several of these altered genes can initiate a cancer and , then , propel it into a deadly state . '' </s>
<s> Scientists call the new class of genes tumor-suppressors , or simply anti-cancer genes . </s>
<s> When functioning normally , they make proteins that hold a cell 's growth in check . </s>
<s> But if the genes are damaged -- perhaps by radiation , a chemical or through a chance accident in cell division -- their growth-suppressing proteins no longer work , and cells normally under control turn malignant . </s>
<s> The newly identified genes differ from a family of genes discovered in the early 1980s called oncogenes . </s>
<s> Oncogenes must be present for a cell to become malignant , but researchers have found them in normal as well as in cancerous cells , suggesting that oncogenes do n't cause cancer by themselves . </s>
<s> In recent months , researchers have come to believe the two types of cancer genes work in concert : An oncogene may turn proliferating cells malignant only after the tumor-suppressor gene has been damaged . </s>
<s> Like all genes , tumor-suppressor genes are inherited in two copies , one from each parent . </s>
<s> Either copy can make the proteins needed to control cell growth , so for cancer to arise , both copies must be impaired . </s>
<s> A person who is born with one defective copy of a suppressor gene , or in whom one copy is damaged early in life , is especially prone to cancer because he need only lose the other copy for a cancer to develop . </s>
<s> Emerging genetic tests will be able to spot such cancer-susceptible individuals , ushering in what some scientists believe is a new age of predictive cancer diagnosis . </s>
<s> Bill and Bonnie Quinlan are among the first beneficiaries of the new findings . </s>
<s> The Dedham , Mass. , couple knew even before Bonnie became pregnant in 1987 that any child of theirs had a 50 % chance of being at risk for retinoblastoma , an eye cancer that occurs about once every 20,000 births . </s>
<s> Mr. Quinlan , 30 years old , knew he carried a damaged gene , having lost an eye to the rare tumor when he was only two months old -- after his mother had suffered the same fate when she was a baby . </s>
<s> Because of the isolation of the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene , it became possible last January to find out what threat the Quinlan baby faced . </s>
<s> A test using new `` genetic probes '' showed that little Will Quinlan had not inherited a damaged retinoblastoma supressor gene and , therefore , faced no more risk than other children of developing the rare cancer . </s>
<s> `` It made our New Year , '' says Mr. Quinlan . </s>
<s> This test was the first to predict reliably whether an individual could expect to develop cancer . </s>
<s> Equally important , the initial discovery of the gene that controls retinal cell growth , made by a Boston doctor named Thaddeus Dryja , has opened a field of cancer study , which in recent months has exploded . </s>
<s> `` It turns out that studying a tragic but uncommon tumor made possible some fundamental insights about the most basic workings of cancer , '' says Samuel Broder , director of the National Cancer Institute . </s>
<s> `` All this may not be obvious to the public , which is concerned about advances in treatment , but I am convinced this basic research will begin showing results there soon . '' </s>
<s> To date , scientists have fingered two of these cancer-suppressors . </s>
<s> Dr. Dryja made his retinoblastoma discovery in 1986 . </s>
<s> Then last spring , researchers reported finding a gene called p53 which , if impaired , turns healthy colon cells cancerous . </s>
<s> Soon after that report , two other research teams uncovered evidence that the same damaged p53 gene is present in tissue from lung and breast cancers . </s>
<s> Colon , lung and breast cancers are the most common and lethal forms of the disease , collectively killing almost 200,000 Americans a year . </s>
<s> Right now about a dozen laboratories , in the U.S. , Canada and Britain , are racing to unmask other suspected tumor-suppressing genes . </s>
<s> They have about seven candidates . </s>
<s> Researchers say the inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes , alone or in combination , appears crucial to the development of such scourges as cancer of the brain , the skin , kidney , prostate , and cervix . </s>
<s> There is evidence that if people inherit defective versions of these genes , they are especially prone to cancer , perhaps explaining , finally , why some cancers seem to haunt certain families . </s>
<s> The story of tumor-suppressor genes goes back to the 1970s , when a pediatrician named Alfred G. Knudson Jr. proposed that retinoblastoma stemmed from two separate genetic defects . </s>
<s> He theorized that in the eye cancer , an infant inherited a damaged copy of a gene from one parent and a normal copy from the other . </s>
<s> The tumor , he suggested , developed when the second , normal copy also was damaged . </s>
<s> But there was no way to prove Dr. Knudson 's `` two-hit '' theory . </s>
<s> Back then , scientists had no way of ferreting out specific genes , but under a microscope they could see the 23 pairs of chromosomes in the cells that contain the genes . </s>
<s> Occasionally , gross chromosome damage was visible . </s>
<s> Dr. Knudson found that some children with the eye cancer had inherited a damaged copy of chromosome No. 13 from a parent who had had the disease . </s>
<s> Under a microscope he could actually see that a bit of chromosome 13 was missing . </s>
<s> He assumed the missing piece contained a gene or genes whose loss had a critical role in setting off the cancer . </s>
<s> But he did n't know which gene or genes had disappeared . </s>
<s> Then , a scientific team led by molecular geneticist Webster Cavenee , then at the University of Utah , found the answer . </s>
<s> The team used a battery of the newly developed `` gene probes , '' snippets of genetic material that can track a gene 's presence in a cell . </s>
<s> By analyzing cells extracted from eye tumors , they found defects in the second copy of chromosome 13 in the exact area as in the first copy of the chromosome . </s>
<s> The finding riveted medicine . </s>
<s> It was the first time anyone had showed that the loss of both copies of the same gene could lead to the eruption of a cancer . </s>
<s> `` It was extraordinarily satisfying , '' says Dr. Knudson , now at Fox Chase Cancer Research Center in Philadelphia . </s>
<s> `` I was convinced that what was true of retinoblastoma would be true for all cancers . '' </s>
<s> It was an audacious claim . </s>
<s> But in Baltimore , Dr. Vogelstein , a young molecular biologist at Johns Hopkins Medical School , believed Dr. Knudson was right , and set out to repeat the Cavenee experiment in cells from other cancers . </s>
<s> His was one of two research teams in 1984 to report dual chromosome losses for a rare childhood cancer of the kidney called Wilm 's tumor . </s>
<s> Dr. Vogelstein next turned his attention to colon cancer , the second biggest cancer killer in the U.S. after lung cancer . </s>
<s> He believed colon cancer might also arise from multiple `` hits '' on cancer suppressor genes , because it often seems to develop in stages . </s>
<s> It often is preceded by the development of polyps in the bowel , which in some cases become increasingly malignant in identifiable stages -- progressing from less severe to deadly -- as though a cascade of genetic damage might be occurring . </s>
<s> Dr. Vogelstein and a doctoral student , Eric Fearon , began months of tedious and often frustrating probing of the chromosomes searching for signs of genetic damage . </s>
<s> They began uncovering a confusing variety of genetic deletions , some existing only in benign polyps , others in malignant cells and many in both polyps and malignant cells . </s>
<s> Gradually , a coherent picture of cancer development emerged . </s>
<s> If both copies of a certain gene were knocked out , benign polyps would develop . </s>
<s> If both copies of a second gene were then deleted , the polyps would progress to malignancy . </s>
<s> It was clear that more than one gene had to be damaged for colon cancer to develop . </s>
<s> Their report galvanized other molecular biologists . </s>
<s> `` It was the confirming evidence we all needed that -LCB- gene -RCB- losses were critical to the development of a common tumor , '' says Ray White at Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Salt Lake City . </s>
<s> But Dr. Vogelstein had yet to nail the identity of the gene that , if damaged , flipped a colon cell into full-blown malignancy . </s>
<s> They focused on chromosome 17 . </s>
<s> For months the Johns Hopkins researchers , using gene probes , experimentally crawled down the length of chromosome 17 , looking for the smallest common bit of genetic material lost in all tumor cells . </s>
<s> Such a piece of DNA would probably constitute a gene . </s>
<s> When they found it last winter , Dr. Vogelstein was dubious that the search was over . </s>
<s> His doubts stemmed from the fact that several years earlier a Princeton University researcher , Arnold Levine , had found in experiments with mice that a gene called p53 could transform normal cells into cancerous ones . </s>
<s> The deletion Dr. Vogelstein found was in exactly the same spot as p53 . </s>
<s> But Mr. Levine had said the p53 gene caused cancer by promoting growth , whereas the Johns Hopkins scientists were looking for a gene that suppressed growth . </s>
<s> Despite that , when the Johns Hopkins scientists compared the gene they had found in the human cancer cells with the Mr. Levine 's p53 gene they found the two were identical ; it turned out that in Mr. Levine 's cancer studies , he had unknowingly been observing a damaged form of p53 -- a cancer-suppressing gene . </s>
<s> The discovery `` suddenly puts an obscure gene right in the cockpit of cancer formation , '' says Robert Weinberg , a leader in cancer-gene research at Whitehead Institute in Cambridge , Mass . </s>
<s> Evidence now is emerging that the p53 suppressor gene is involved in other cancers , too . </s>
<s> Researchers in Edinburgh , Scotland , have found that in 23 of 38 breast tumors , one copy of chromosome 17 was mutated at the spot where gene p53 lies . </s>
<s> The scientists say that since breast cancer often strikes multiple members of certain families , the gene , when inherited in a damaged form , may predispose women to the cancer . </s>
<s> The p53 gene has just been implicated in lung cancer . </s>
<s> In a report out last week , John Minna and colleagues at the National Cancer Institute say that about half the cells taken from lung cancer tissue they tested are missing this gene . </s>
<s> There also are reports from several labs , as yet unpublished , of missing p53 genes in tissue taken from kidney , brain and skin cancers . </s>
<s> At the same time , the Johns Hopkins team and others are rushing to pinpoint other tumor-suppressor genes . </s>
<s> Dr. Vogelstein hopes soon to isolate one on chromosome 18 , also involved in colon cancer . </s>
<s> Ray White in Utah and Walter Bodmer , a researcher in Great Britain , are close to finding another gene involved with some types of colon cancer , thought to be on chromosome 5 . </s>
<s> Dr. Minna believes people who inherit a defective gene somewhere on one of their two copies of chromosome 3 are especially prone to lung cancer . </s>
<s> Recently , he and others reported that the retinoblastoma suppressor gene may also be involved in some lung cancers , as well as several other more common cancers , too . </s>
<s> Where these discoveries will lead , scientists can only speculate . </s>
<s> Already two major pharmaceutical companies , the Squibb unit of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. , are collaborating with gene hunters to turn the anticipated cascade of discoveries into predictive tests and , maybe , new therapies . </s>
<s> Some researchers say new cancer drugs to slow or reverse tumor growth may be based on the suppressor proteins normally produced by the genes . </s>
<s> The idea would be to administer to patients the growth-controlling proteins made by healthy versions of the damaged genes . </s>
<s> It may even be possible to replace defective genes with healthy versions , though no one has come close to doing that so far . </s>
<s> In any case , says Dr. Minna of the National Cancer Institute , `` We 're witnessing the discovery of one of the most important steps in the genesis of cancer . </s>
