<s> Pierre Peladeau , a Canadian newspaper publisher little-known in the U.S. , figures to become a big player in North American printing -- and his ambitions do n't end there . </s>
<s> Yesterday , Quebecor Inc. , a Montreal printing , publishing and forest-products company 53%-owned by Mr. Peladeau , agreed to acquire Maxwell Communication Corp. 's U.S. printing subsidiary , Maxwell Graphics Inc. , for $ 500 million in cash and securities . </s>
<s> The purchase , expected to be completed by year end , will make Quebecor the second-largest commercial printer in North America , behind only R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co. , Chicago . </s>
<s> The printing customers that Quebecor will gain through Maxwell Graphics include the Sunday newspaper supplement Parade , Time , Sports Illustrated and TV Guide . </s>
<s> But the transaction is just Mr. Peladeau 's latest step in a larger design : to build Quebecor through acquisitions into an integrated paper , publishing and printing concern with a reach throughout North America . </s>
<s> He already has achieved vertical integration on a limited scale : Quebecor can put a weekly newspaper on almost any Quebec doorstep without using outside help , from chopping down the tree to making the newsprint to flinging it up onto the porch . </s>
<s> Analysts say Quebecor 's purchase is part of a trend toward consolidation in the North American printing industry . </s>
<s> Along with Donnelley , says Jacques Massicotte , an analyst with Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc. in Montreal , `` Quebecor has positioned itself as one of the two key players . '' </s>
<s> He adds : `` I think this is a great strategic move for Quebecor . </s>
<s> They are buying an operation that is running well . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Peladeau says he is n't trying to catch up to Donnelley , which has annual sales of over $ 3 billion . </s>
<s> `` Size does n't matter , '' Mr. Peladeau says . </s>
<s> `` What counts is the bottom line . '' </s>
<s> Some of Mr. Peladeau 's ventures , including an earlier push into the U.S. market , have n't paid off on the bottom line . </s>
<s> Quebecor started the Philadelphia Journal , a daily tabloid , in 1977 and closed it three years later . </s>
<s> The venture cost Quebecor $ 12 million , Mr. Peladeau says . </s>
<s> More recently , some former Quebecor executives started their own printing company , specializing in printing and distributing advertising circulars . </s>
<s> Quebecor still lags in the Quebec circulars market , while Mr. Peladeau 's former employees are expanding across Canada . </s>
<s> Mr. Peladeau took his first big gamble 25 years ago , when he took advantage of a strike at La Presse , then Montreal 's dominant French-language newspaper , to launch the Journal de Montreal . </s>
<s> The tabloid 's circulation soared to 80,000 , but plunged to under 10,000 when the La Presse strike ended . </s>
<s> Still , Mr. Peladeau stuck with the venture . </s>
<s> Now the Journal , flush with ads and hugely profitable , is even with La Presse in weekend circulation and outsells it 3 to 2 every weekday . </s>
<s> Mr. Peladeau has never made any apologies for publishing the tabloid , a brash mix of crime and sports . </s>
<s> `` I 've read Balzac , '' he answers critics . </s>
<s> `` It 's tabloid news from A to Z . '' </s>
<s> Quebecor also publishes a second tabloid in Montreal , the struggling 18-month-old Montreal Daily News ; dailies in Quebec City and Winnipeg , Manitoba ; and dozens of weeklies covering most of Quebec . </s>
<s> A series of recent acquisitions made it the dominant magazine publisher in Quebec . </s>
<s> After a recent merger , it is also the only province-wide distributor of magazines and newspapers in Quebec . </s>
<s> Finally , with Maxwell Communication , the company controls 54 % of Donohue Inc. , a Quebec City pulp and paper concern . </s>
<s> In yesterday 's accord , Quebecor agreed to pay $ 400 million in cash for Maxwell Graphics , and to give Maxwell Communication a 20 % stake , valued at $ 100 million , in Quebecor 's new printing subsidiary . </s>
<s> The new , as yet unnamed , subsidiary will combine Quebecor 's existing printing unit and Maxwell Graphics . </s>
<s> It will have 61 plants from coast to coast and $ 1.5 billion in annual sales . </s>
<s> Quebecor will own 57.5 % of the new subsidiary . </s>
<s> Caisse de Depot et Placement , the Quebec government pension-fund agency , will pay $ 112.5 million for the remaining 22.5 % stake in the printing operation . </s>
<s> Pierre-Karl Peladeau , the founder 's son and the executive in charge of the acquisition , says Quebecor has n't decided how it will finance its share of the purchase , but he says it most likely will use debt . </s>
<s> The Maxwell deal is Quebecor 's second big printing acquisition in just over a year . </s>
<s> Last October , Quebecor bought 23 Canadian printing plants from BCE Inc. , a Montreal telecommunications , manufacturing , energy and real estate company . </s>
<s> That purchase doubled Quebecor 's annual printing revenue to $ 750 million . </s>
<s> Maxwell 's sale of its U.S. printing unit was expected , the last major business to be disposed of in a major reshuffling of assets . </s>
<s> According to its most recent annual report , covering the 15 months ended March 31 , Maxwell Communication bought $ 3.85 billion in assets -- including Macmillan Inc. and Official Airlines Guides -- and sold $ 2 billion in non-strategic businesses . </s>
<s> Now , Maxwell founder Robert Maxwell says he has an appetite for new acquisitions in the U.S. , adding that he could spend `` a good deal more '' than $ 1 billion on another U.S. purchase . </s>
<s> In London trading yesterday , Maxwell Communication shares rose nine pence , to 216 pence -LRB- $ 3.41 -RRB- . </s>
<s> In Montreal , Quebecor 's multiple voting Class A stock closed at C$ 16.375 -LRB- US$ 13.94 -RRB- , down 12.5 Canadian cents . </s>
<s> Quebecor Class B stock closed at C$ 15.375 , up 62.5 Canadian cents . </s>
