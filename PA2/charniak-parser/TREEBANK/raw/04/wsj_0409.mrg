<s> Tom Panelli had a perfectly good reason for not using the $ 300 rowing machine he bought three years ago . </s>
<s> `` I ate a bad tuna sandwich , got food poisoning and had to have a shot in my shoulder , '' he says , making it too painful to row . </s>
<s> The soreness , he admits , went away about a week after the shot . </s>
<s> Yet the rowing machine has n't been touched since , even though he has moved it across the country with him twice . </s>
<s> A San Francisco lawyer , Mr. Panelli rowed religiously when he first got the machine , but , he complains , it left grease marks on his carpet , `` and it was boring . </s>
<s> It 's a horrible machine , actually . </s>
<s> I 'm ashamed I own the stupid thing . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Panelli has plenty of company . </s>
<s> Nearly three-fourths of the people who own home exercise equipment do n't use it as much as they planned , according to The Wall Street Journal 's `` American Way of Buying '' survey . </s>
<s> The Roper Organization , which conducted the survey , said almost half of the exercise equipment owners found it duller than they expected . </s>
<s> It is n't just exercise gear that is n't getting a good workout . </s>
<s> The fitness craze itself has gone soft , the survey found . </s>
<s> Fewer people said they were working up a sweat with such activities as jogging , tennis , swimming and aerobics . </s>
<s> Half of those surveyed said they simply walk these days for exercise . </s>
<s> That 's good news for marketers of walking shoes . </s>
<s> The survey also detected a bit more interest in golf , a positive sign for country clubs and golf club makers . </s>
<s> The survey 's findings certainly are n't encouraging for marketers of health-club memberships , tennis rackets and home exercise equipment , but people 's good intentions , if not their actions , are keeping sales of some fitness products healthy . </s>
<s> For instance , sales of treadmills , exercise bikes , stair climbers and the like are expected to rise 8 % to about $ 1.52 billion this year , according to the National Sporting Goods Association , which sees the home market as one of the hottest growth areas for the 1990s . </s>
<s> But even that group knows some people do n't use their machines as much as they should . </s>
<s> `` The first excuse is they do n't have enough time , '' says research director Thomas Doyle . </s>
<s> `` The second is they do n't have enough discipline . '' </s>
<s> With more than 15 million exercise bikes sold in the past five years , he adds , `` a lot of garages , basements and attics must be populated with them . '' </s>
<s> Still , the average price of such bikes rose last year to $ 145 . </s>
<s> Mr. Doyle predicts a trend toward fewer pieces of home exercise equipment being sold at higher prices . </s>
<s> Electronic gimmicks are key . </s>
<s> Premark International Inc. , for example , peddles the M8.7sp Electronic Cycling Simulator , a $ 2,000 stationary cycle . </s>
<s> On a video screen , riders can see 30 different `` rides , '' including urban , mountain and desert scenes , and check how many calories are burned a minute . </s>
<s> Nancy Igdaloff , who works in corporate payments at Bank of America in San Francisco , may be a good prospect for such a gizmo . </s>
<s> She 's trying to sell a $ 150 exercise bike she bought about five years ago for her roommate . </s>
<s> But rather than write off home fitness equipment , she traded up : Ms. Igdaloff just paid about $ 900 for a fancier stationary bike , with a timer , dials showing average and maximum speeds and a comfortable seat that feels almost like a chair . </s>
<s> `` I 'm using it a lot , '' she says . </s>
<s> `` I spent so much money that if I look at it , and I 'm not on it , I feel guilty . '' </s>
<s> The poll points up some inconsistencies between what people say and what they do . </s>
<s> A surprising 78 % of people said they exercise regularly , up from 73 % in 1981 . </s>
<s> This conjures up images of a nation full of trim , muscular folks , and suggests couch potatoes are out of season . </s>
<s> Of course , that is n't really the case . </s>
<s> The discrepancy may be because asking people about their fitness regime is a bit like inquiring about their love life . </s>
<s> They 're bound to exaggerate . </s>
<s> `` People say they swim , and that may mean they 've been to the beach this year , '' says Krys Spain , research specialist for the President 's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports . </s>
<s> `` It 's hard to know if people are responding truthfully . </s>
<s> People are too embarrassed to say they have n't done anything . '' </s>
<s> While she applauds the fact that more Americans are getting up from the television to stroll or garden , she says the percentage of Americans who do `` real exercise to build the heart '' is only 10 % to 20 % . </s>
<s> So many people fudge on answers about exercise , the president 's council now uses specific criteria to determine what is considered vigorous : It must produce contractions of large muscle groups , must achieve 60 % of maximum aerobic capacity and must be done three or more times a week for a minimum of 20 minutes . </s>
<s> One of the council 's goals , set in 1980 , was to see more than 60 % of adults under 65 years of age getting vigorous exercise by 1990 . </s>
<s> That target has been revised to 30 % by the year 2000 . </s>
<s> But even that goal may prove optimistic . </s>
<s> Of 14 activities , the Journal survey found that 12 -- including bicycling , skiing and swimming -- are being done by fewer Americans today than eight years ago . </s>
<s> Time pressures and the ebb of the fitness fad are cited as reasons for the decline . </s>
<s> Only walking and golf increased in popularity during the 1980s -- and only slightly . </s>
<s> Jeanette Traverso , a California lawyer , gave up running three times a week to play a weekly round of golf , finding it more social and serene . </s>
<s> It 's an activity she feels she can do for life , and by pulling a golf cart , she still gets a good workout . </s>
<s> `` I 'm really wiped out after walking five hours , '' she says . </s>
<s> Most people said they exercise both for health and enjoyment . </s>
<s> `` If you sit down all the time , you 'll go stiff , '' says Joyce Hagood , a Roxboro , N.C. , homemaker who walks several miles a week . </s>
<s> `` And it 's relaxing . </s>
<s> Sometimes , if you have a headache , you can go out and walk it right off . '' </s>
<s> Only about a quarter of the respondents said they exercise to lose weight . </s>
<s> Slightly more , like Leslie Sherren , a law librarian in San Francisco who attends dance aerobics five times a week , exercise to relieve stress . </s>
<s> `` Working with lawyers , '' she says , `` I need it . '' </s>
<s> But fully 90 % of those polled felt they did n't need to belong to a health club . </s>
<s> `` They 're too crowded , and everybody 's showing off , '' says Joel Bryant , a 22-year-old student from Pasadena , Calif . </s>
<s> `` The guys are being macho , and the girls are walking around in little things . </s>
<s> They 're not there to work out . '' </s>
<s> But at least they show up . </s>
<s> Nearly half of those who joined health clubs said they did n't use their membership as often as they planned . </s>
<s> Feeling they should devote more time to their families or their jobs , many yuppies are skipping their once-sacred workout . </s>
<s> Even so , the Association of Quality Clubs , a health-club trade group in Boston , says membership revenues will rise about 5 % this year from last year 's $ 5 billion . </s>
<s> A spokeswoman adds , however , that the group is considering offering `` a behavior-modification course , similar to a smoking-cessation program , to teach people ways to stay with it . '' </s>
<s> There are die-hard bodies , of course . </s>
<s> The proprietor of Sante West , an aerobics studio in San Francisco 's Marina district , which was hit hard by the earthquake , says , `` People were going nuts the minute we opened , '' three days after the quake . </s>
<s> `` The emotional aspect is so draining , they needed a good workout . '' </s>
<s> Perhaps the most disturbing finding is that the bowling alley may be an endangered American institution . </s>
<s> The survey reported the number of people who said they bowl regularly has fallen to just 8 % from 17 % in 1981 . </s>
<s> The American Bowling Congress claims a higher percentage of the public bowls regularly , but concedes its membership has declined this decade . </s>
<s> To find out why , the group recently commissioned a study of the past 20 years of bowling-related research . </s>
<s> Three reasons were pinpointed : a preference for watching bowling and other sports on television rather than actually bowling , dowdy bowling centers , and dissatisfaction with bowling itself . </s>
<s> People who start bowling expecting it to be a pleasurable exercise `` have been generally disappointed , '' the report said . </s>
<s> But not Richard Cottrell , a San Francisco cab driver who bowls in two weekly leagues . </s>
<s> He hit the lanes three years ago on the advice of his doctor . </s>
<s> `` It 's good exercise , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` I ca n't do anything score-wise , but I like meeting the girls . '' </s>
<s> He says bowling helps him shed pounds , though that effort is sometimes thwarted by the fact that `` when I 'm drinking , I bowl better . '' </s>
<s> His Tuesday night team , the Leftovers , is in first place . </s>
