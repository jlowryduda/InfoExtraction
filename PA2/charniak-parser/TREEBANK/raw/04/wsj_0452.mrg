<s> The Supreme Court agreed to decide whether the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. may require LTV Corp. to reassume funding responsibility for a $ 2.3 billion shortfall in the company 's pension plans . </s>
<s> The high court 's decision , expected next spring , may affect the stability of many large corporate pension plans that have relied on the availability of pension insurance provided by the federal pension regulatory and insurance agency . </s>
<s> The agency , which is funded through insurance premiums from employers , insures pension benefits for some 30 million private-sector workers who take part in single-employer pension plans . </s>
<s> It recently reported assets of $ 2.4 billion and liabilities of $ 4 billion . </s>
<s> In its appeal to the high court , the agency said the federal appeals court ruling , which favored LTV , threatened to transform the agency from an insurer of troubled pension plans into an `` open-ended source of industry bailouts . '' </s>
<s> The ruling also may determine how quickly LTV is able to complete its Chapter 11 reorganization . </s>
<s> LTV filed for protection under Chapter 11 in federal bankruptcy court in 1986 . </s>
<s> The filing was partly the result of the $ 2.3 billion shortfall in LTV 's three pension plans operated for its LTV Steel Co. subsidiary 's employees . </s>
<s> In January 1987 , as LTV Steel continued operating while under reorganization , the agency terminated the three LTV pension plans to keep its insurance liability from increasing . </s>
<s> Termination means that the agency 's insurance assumes the liabilities and pays the pension benefits already owed under the plans , but workers do n't accrue new benefits . </s>
<s> A few months later , under pressure from the United Steelworkers of America , LTV instituted a new program to provide retirement benefits similar to those in the terminated plans . </s>
<s> Because the federal pension agency had taken over the old plans , LTV would be responsible only for benefits paid under the new pension plans . </s>
<s> But the agency viewed the creation of the new plans as an abuse of federal pension law and an attempt to transfer the liability of the $ 2.3 billion shortfall from LTV to federal insurance . </s>
<s> The agency also concluded that LTV 's financial status had improved while it was under reorganization . </s>
<s> In September 1987 , it ordered LTV to reassume liability and funding for the three original plans . </s>
<s> LTV challenged the order , and a federal district court in New York in June 1988 ruled that the agency improperly ordered LTV to reassume responsibility for the plans . </s>
<s> In May , a federal appeals court in New York agreed that the agency acted unlawfully . </s>
<s> The appeals court said there was no evidence that Congress intended to allow the pension agency to consider a company 's creation of new benefit plans as a basis for ordering that company to reassume liability for old plans . </s>
<s> The appeals court also said the agency had to consider a company 's long-term ability to fund pension plans , not just short-term improved financial status . </s>
<s> In Dallas , LTV said that it was disappointed that the court agreed to hear the case because it believes the move will further delay its Chapter 11 proceedings . </s>
<s> The company has n't been able to come up with a reorganization plan , in part , because of the sizable disagreement with the pension agency . </s>
<s> But LTV , a steel , aerospace and energy concern , said it is confident that the Supreme Court will uphold the lower-court decisions and said it expects to continue discussions with the agency about a settlement while the case is being reviewed . </s>
