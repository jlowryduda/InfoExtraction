<s> The recently revived enthusiasm among small investors for stock mutual funds has been damped by a jittery stock market and the tumult over program trading . </s>
<s> After hitting two-year highs this summer , net sales of stock funds slowed in September , according to the Investment Company Institute , a trade group . </s>
<s> The sales recovery screeched to a halt this month , some analysts say . </s>
<s> `` Confidence was starting to come back because we did n't have wildly volatile days , '' says Tyler Jenks , research director for Kanon Bloch Carre & Co. , a Boston research firm . </s>
<s> `` Now everything '' -- such as program trading and wide stock market swings -- `` that everyone had pushed back in their consciousness is just sitting right there . '' </s>
<s> Net sales of stock funds in September totaled $ 839.4 million , down from $ 1.1 billion in August , the institute said . </s>
<s> But if reinvested dividends are excluded , investors put in only $ 340 million more than they pulled out for the month . </s>
<s> October 's numbers , which wo n't be released for a month , are down further , mutual fund executives say . </s>
<s> Investors in stock funds did n't panic the weekend after mid-October 's 190-point market plunge . </s>
<s> Most of the those who left stock funds simply switched into money market funds . </s>
<s> And some fund groups said investors actually became net buyers . </s>
<s> But the stock market swings have continued . </s>
<s> The recent outcry over program trading will cast a pall over the stock-fund environment in the coming months , some analysts say . </s>
<s> `` The public is very close to having had it , '' Mr. Jenks says . </s>
<s> Investors pulled back from bond funds in September , too . </s>
<s> Net sales of bond funds for the month totaled $ 1.1 billion , down two-thirds from $ 3.1 billion in August . </s>
<s> The major reason : heavy outflows from high-risk , high-yield junk bond funds . </s>
<s> Big withdrawals from the junk funds have continued this month . </s>
<s> Overall , net sales of all mutual funds , excluding money market funds , fell to $ 1.9 billion in September from $ 4.2 billion in August , the trade group said . </s>
<s> `` Small net inflows into stock and bond funds were offset by slight declines in the value of mutual fund stock and bond portfolios '' stemming from falling prices , said Jacob Dreyer , the institute 's chief economist . </s>
<s> Many small investors went for the safety of money market funds . </s>
<s> Assets of these and other short-term funds surged more than $ 5 billion in September , the institute said . </s>
<s> Analysts say additional investors transferred their assets into money funds this month . </s>
<s> At Fidelity Investments , the nation 's largest fund group , money funds continue to draw the most business , says Michael Hines , vice president , marketing . </s>
<s> In October , net sales of stock funds at Fidelity dropped sharply , Mr. Hines said . </s>
<s> But he emphasized that new accounts , new sales , inquiries and subsequent sales of stock funds are all up this month from September 's level . </s>
<s> Investor interest in stock funds `` has n't stalled at all , '' Mr. Hines maintains . </s>
<s> He notes that most of the net sales drop stemmed from a three-day period following the Friday the 13th plunge . </s>
<s> `` If that follows through next month , then it will be a different story , '' he says . </s>
<s> But , Mr. Hines adds , sales `` based on a few days ' events do n't tell you much about October 's trends . '' </s>
<s> One trend that continues is growth in the money invested in funds . </s>
<s> Buoyed by the continued inflows into money funds , assets of all mutual funds swelled to a record $ 953.8 billion in September , up fractionally from $ 949.3 billion in August . </s>
<s> Stock-fund managers , meantime , went into October with less cash on hand than they held earlier this year . </s>
<s> These managers held 9.8 % of assets in cash at the end of September , down from 10.2 % in August and 10.6 % in September 1988 . </s>
<s> Large cash positions help buffer funds from market declines but can cut down on gains in rising markets . </s>
<s> Managers of junk funds were bolstering their cash hoards after the September cash crunch at Campeau Corp . </s>
<s> Junk-portfolio managers raised their cash position to 9.4 % of assets in September from 8.3 % in August . </s>
<s> In September 1988 , that level was 9.5 % . </s>
<s> Investors in all funds will seek safety in the coming months , some analysts say . </s>
<s> Among stock funds , the conservative growth-and-income portfolios probably will remain popular , fund specialists say . </s>
<s> `` There will be a continuation and possibly greater focus on conservative equity funds , at the expense of growth and aggressive growth funds , '' says Avi Nachmany , an analyst at Strategic Insight , a New York fund-research concern . </s>
