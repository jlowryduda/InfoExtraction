<s> Hospital Regulation Sparks Kentucky Feud </s>
<s> WHICH IS the best medicine for runaway health costs : competition or regulation ? </s>
<s> The question is at the root of a brawl between Humana Inc. , the big for-profit hospital and insurance company , and its not-for-profit brethren in its home state of Kentucky . </s>
<s> The battle focuses on the state 's certificate-of-need law , which regulates investment in new medical technology . </s>
<s> The law has prevented $ 216 million of unnecessary expenditures since 1986 , according to William S. Conn , president of the Kentucky Hospital Association . </s>
<s> But according to David Jones , Humana 's chief executive , it promotes technology monopolies , stifles innovation and raises prices . </s>
<s> If the Legislature does n't repeal the law , due for revision in 1990 , Mr. Jones says Humana may move its insurance operations , including 3,000 jobs in Louisville , to another state . </s>
<s> The company complains that it paid $ 10 million to non-Humana hospitals in its latest fiscal year for services provided to its insurance plan members . </s>
<s> But Humana says its own facilities could serve its insured for less if they were properly equipped . </s>
<s> Mr. Conn charges that Humana 's own actions undermine its argument . </s>
<s> When a hospital in Lexington installed a lithotripter last year , demand for a similar kidney-stone smashing machine at a Humana hospital in Louisville fell 34 % . </s>
<s> The Humana hospital responded by jacking up prices to make up for lost revenue , Mr. Conn says , and now charges as much as $ 8,000 for the procedure , which costs only about $ 3,500 in Lexington . </s>
<s> Humana contends that $ 8,000 represents an extreme case and that its regular charge for lithotripsy is $ 4,900 . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , another hospital 's proposal for a new-generation lithotripter is pending before the board that administers the certificate-of-need law . </s>
<s> Humana , which wants to acquire one of the new machines itself , is on the record as opposed to the proposal . </s>
<s> Debt-Burdened Doctors Seek Financial Security </s>
<s> HEALTH-CARE experts have long worried that young doctors emerging from medical school with a mountain of debt will choose careers in high-paying specialties instead of primary care , where more physicians are needed most . </s>
<s> Now there 's a new wrinkle in what young doctors want : More than half of 300 residents responding to recent survey said they 'd prefer a guaranteed salary over traditional fee-for-service compensation in their first professional position . </s>
<s> And 81 % preferred a group practice or health maintenance organization , while just 11 % favored solo practice . </s>
<s> `` Ten years ago , a physician would go to a town and take out a loan -LRB- to start a practice -RRB- , '' says James Merritt , president of Merritt , Hawkins & Associates , an Irvine , Calif. , physician recruiter that conducted the survey . </s>
<s> `` They wo n't do that very often today at all . </s>
<s> They 're looking for something that 's very safe . '' </s>
<s> The numbers behind such fears : The average debt of medical school graduates who borrowed to pay for their education jumped 10 % to $ 42,374 this year from $ 38,489 in 1988 , says the Association of American Medical Colleges . </s>
<s> That 's 115 % more than in 1981 . </s>
<s> Money is n't the only reason for the shift in practice preferences . </s>
<s> It reflects values of a generation that wants more time for families and personal interests , says John H. Moxley III , who directs physician-executive searches for Korn\/Ferry International . </s>
<s> `` This is a change in the social fabric of medicine , '' he says . </s>
<s> Related Roommates Trim Hospital Bills </s>
<s> WHEN Catherine Bobar spent several weeks at the Medical Center of Vermont recently with a bone infection in her toe , she shared a room just like most patients . </s>
<s> But unlike most patients , her roommate was her husband . </s>
<s> `` It was certainly good to have him handy , '' Mrs. Bobar says . </s>
<s> The 12-bed `` cooperative care '' unit is one of about 18 nationwide where a family member or friend helps care for a patient in the hospital . </s>
<s> `` The philosophy is to make the patient and the family very responsible for a portion of their own care , '' says Anthony J. Grieco , medical director of cooperative care at New York University Medical Center , where the concept began 10 years ago . </s>
<s> `` It helps us , and them , while they 're here , and it certainly makes them a better health-care team when they get home . '' </s>
<s> It also saves money . </s>
<s> Because patients require less attention from nurses and other staff , room charges are lower -- about $ 100 less per day than a regular room at the Vermont hospital . </s>
<s> Cancer patients needing prolonged radiation therapy , diabetics learning to manage their blood sugar levels , and cardiac bypass patients are among those who spend time on cooperative-care units . </s>
<s> The approach has generated so much interest that NYU is host to the first conference on cooperative care Nov. 30 . </s>
<s> `` It 's really part of the hospital of the 21st century , '' Dr. Grieco says . </s>
<s> Odds and Ends </s>
<s> THE CHIEF NURSING officer can be responsible for more than 1,000 employees and at least one-third of a hospital 's budget ; a head nurse typically oversees up to 80 employees and $ 8 million . </s>
<s> So says the Commonwealth Fund , a New York philanthropist that 's sponsoring a $ 1 million project to develop joint masters in business and nursing programs at 10 universities ... . </s>
<s> Meharry Medical College in Nashville , Tenn. , launches a new research publication in the spring : the Journal on Health Care for the Poor and Underserved . </s>
