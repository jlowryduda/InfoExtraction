<s> The commercial was absolutely silent . </s>
<s> Breaking into the raucous Chicago Bears-Cleveland Browns match during last week 's Monday night football game , it was nothing but simple block letters superimposed on the TV screen . </s>
<s> `` Due to the earthquake in San Francisco , Nissan is donating its commercial air time to broadcast American Red Cross Emergency Relief messages . </s>
<s> Please contribute what you can , '' the ad said . </s>
<s> The Nissan logo flashed on the screen for a moment , and then came a taped plea for donations from former President Reagan -- followed by the silent print telling viewers where to call . </s>
<s> Within two hours , viewers pledged over $ 400,000 , according to a Red Cross executive . </s>
<s> Call it disaster marketing . </s>
<s> Nissan Motor is just one of a slew of advertisers that have hitched their ads to the devastating San Francisco quake and Hurricane Hugo . </s>
<s> Sometimes , the ads attempt to raise money ; always , they try to boost good will . </s>
<s> By advertising disaster relief , these companies are hoping to don a white hat and come out a hero . </s>
<s> But the strategy can backfire ; if the ads appear too self-serving , the companies may end up looking like rank opportunists instead of good Samaritans . </s>
<s> That has n't deterred plenty of companies . </s>
<s> Along with Nissan , Grand Metropolitan PLC 's Burger King and New York Life Insurance have tied ads to Red Cross donations . </s>
<s> Other ads do n't bother with the fundraising ; a touching , if self-congratulatory , American Telephone & Telegraph ad that aired Sunday intermixed footage of the devastation in San Francisco and Charleston , S.C. , with interviews of people recounting how AT&T helped . </s>
<s> At Nissan , `` we felt we wanted to do something to help them gather money , and we had this airtime on Monday Night Football , '' explains Brooke Mitzel , a Nissan advertising creative manager . </s>
<s> `` What did we get out of it ? </s>
<s> We got some exposure ... and pretty much good will . '' </s>
<s> The ads are just the latest evidence of how television advertising is getting faster on the draw . </s>
<s> While TV commercials typically take weeks to produce , advertisers in the past couple of years have learned to turn on a dime , to crash out ads in days or even hours . </s>
<s> The big brokerage houses learned the art of the instant commercial after the 1987 crash , when they turned out reassuring ads inviting investors right back into the stock market . </s>
<s> They trotted out another crop of instant commercials after the sudden market dip a few weeks ago . </s>
<s> Nissan created its quake ad in a weekend . </s>
<s> But as advertisers latch onto disasters with increasing frequency , they risk hurting themselves as much as helping the cause . </s>
<s> They chance alienating the customers they hope to woo by looking like opportunistic sharks . </s>
<s> `` People see extra messages in advertising , and if a manufacturer is clearly trying to get something out of it ... if it 's too transparent ... then consumers will see through that , '' warns John Philip Jones , chairman of the advertising department at the Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University . </s>
<s> `` It can backfire because companies can step across the line and go too far , be too pushy , '' agrees Gary Stibel , a principal with New England Consulting Group , Westport , Conn . </s>
<s> `` The ultimate form of charity is when you do n't tell anyone . '' </s>
<s> Still , he says that only a few of the quake-related campaigns have been `` tasteless '' and that `` the majority have been truly beneficial to the people who need the help . </s>
<s> We do n't consider that ambulance chasing . '' </s>
<s> The companies running the disaster ads certainly do n't see themselves as ambulance chasers , either . </s>
<s> Burger King 's chief executive officer , Barry Gibbons , stars in ads saying that the fast-food chain will donate 25 cents to the Red Cross for every purchase of a BK Doubles hamburger . </s>
<s> The campaign , which started last week and runs through Nov. 23 , with funds earmarked for both the quake and Hugo , `` was Barry 's idea , '' a spokeswoman says . </s>
<s> `` Barry felt very committed . </s>
<s> He felt we should be giving something back . '' </s>
<s> While the campaign was Mr. Gibbons 's idea , however , he wo n't be paying for it : The donations will come out of the chain 's national advertising fund , which is financed by the franchisees . </s>
<s> And by basing donations on BK Doubles , a new double-hamburger line the fast-food chain is trying to push , Burger King works a sales pitch into its public-service message . </s>
<s> Toyota 's upscale Lexus division , a sponsor of the World Series , also put in a plug for Red Cross donations in a World Series game it sponsored . </s>
<s> `` The World Series is brought to you by Lexus , who urges you to help relieve the suffering caused by the recent earthquake ... , '' the game announcer said . </s>
<s> And New York Life made a plea for Red Cross donations in newspaper ads in the San Francisco area , latching onto the coattails of the Red Cross 's impeccable reputation : `` The Red Cross has been helping people for 125 years . </s>
<s> New York Life has been doing the same for over 140 years . '' </s>
<s> Nancy Craig , advertising manager for the Red Cross , readily admits `` they 're piggybacking on our reputation . '' </s>
<s> But she has no problem with that , she says : `` In the meanwhile , they 're helping us . '' </s>
<s> The Red Cross does n't track contributions raised by the disaster ads , but it has amassed $ 46.6 million since it first launched its hurricane relief effort Sept. 23 . </s>
<s> Ad Notes ... . </s>
<s> NEW ACCOUNT : </s>
<s> Northrup King Co. , Golden Valley , Minn. , awarded its $ 4 million field-crop-seeds account to Creswell , Munsell , Fultz & Zirbel , a Cedar Rapids , Iowa , division of Young & Rubicam . </s>
<s> The account had previously been handled by Saatchi & Saatchi Wegener , New York . </s>
<s> TV GUIDE : </s>
<s> Wieden & Kennedy , Portland , Ore. , was named to handle the News Corp. publication 's $ 1 million to $ 2 million trade-ad account . </s>
<s> N W Ayer , the New York agency that had handled the account since 1963 , resigned the account about two weeks ago . </s>
<s> NO ALCOHOL : </s>
<s> Miller Brewing Co. will introduce its first non-alcoholic beer Jan. 1 . </s>
<s> The brew , called Miller Sharp 's , will be supported by ads developed by Frankenberry , Laughlin & Constable , Milwaukee . </s>
