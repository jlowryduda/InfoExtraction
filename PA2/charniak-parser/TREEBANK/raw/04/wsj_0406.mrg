<s> -LRB- During its centennial year , The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history . -RRB- </s>
<s> MAY 1 , 1975 , SIGNALED A DISTRESSFUL May Day for securities houses , which were forced to end 183 years of charging fixed commissions . </s>
<s> It scared brokers , but most survived . </s>
<s> It took effect after seven years of bitter debate between the Securities and Exchange Commission and traders and exchanges . </s>
<s> Despite warnings from such leaders as former Federal Reserve Board Chairman William McChesney Martin that unfixed commissions would undo the industry , the SEC in September 1973 said full competition must start May l , 1975 . </s>
<s> The timing for change was right . </s>
<s> Institutions had become active market players in the early 1970s and sought exchange seats to handle their own trades . </s>
<s> And the industry was rife with brokers trying to secure big client orders by using kickbacks , gifts , women and junkets . </s>
<s> Within three weeks of the 1975 end to fixed rates there were all-out price wars among brokers fighting for institutional business , with rate slashes of 35 % to 60 % below pre-May 1 levels . </s>
<s> Ray Garrett Jr. , SEC chairman , said the `` breadth and depth of the discounting is more than I expected . '' </s>
<s> Even a federal measure in June allowing houses to add research fees to their commissions did n't stop it . </s>
<s> Longer term , the impact is unclear . </s>
<s> The change prompted the rise of discount brokers and a reduction in securities research firms . </s>
<s> But there are currently more exchange members than in 1975 , with the bigger houses gaining a larger share of total commissions . </s>
<s> Commissions , however , account for a smaller share of investment-house business as takeover advisory fees have soared . </s>
<s> Foreign stock markets , with which the U.S. is entwined , also have ended fixed commissions in recent years . </s>
<s> It came in London 's `` Big Bang '' 1986 deregulation ; and Toronto 's `` Little Bang '' the same year . </s>
<s> Paris is currently phasing out fixed commissions under its `` Le Petit Bang '' plan . </s>
