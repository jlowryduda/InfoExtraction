<s> As an actor , Charles Lane is n't the inheritor of Charlie Chaplin 's spirit . </s>
<s> Steve Martin has already laid his claim to that . </s>
<s> But it is Mr. Lane , as movie director , producer and writer , who has been obsessed with refitting Chaplin 's Little Tramp in a contemporary way . </s>
<s> In 1976 , as a film student at the Purchase campus of the State University of New York , Mr. Lane shot `` A Place in Time , '' a 36-minute black-and-white film about a sketch artist , a man of the streets . </s>
<s> Now , 13 years later , Mr. Lane has revived his Artist in a full-length movie called `` Sidewalk Stories , '' a poignant piece of work about a modern-day tramp . </s>
<s> Of course , if the film contained dialogue , Mr. Lane 's Artist would be called a homeless person . </s>
<s> So would the Little Tramp , for that matter . </s>
<s> I say `` contained dialogue '' because `` Sidewalk Stories '' is n't really silent at all . </s>
<s> Composer Marc Marder , a college friend of Mr. Lane 's who earns his living playing the double bass in classical music ensembles , has prepared an exciting , eclectic score that tells you what the characters are thinking and feeling far more precisely than intertitles , or even words , would . </s>
<s> Much of Mr. Lane 's film takes a highly romanticized view of life on the streets -LRB- though probably no more romanticized than Mr. Chaplin 's notion of the Tramp as the good-hearted free spirit -RRB- . </s>
<s> Filmed in lovely black and white by Bill Dill , the New York streets of `` Sidewalk Stories '' seem benign . </s>
<s> On Wall Street men and women walk with great purpose , noticing one another only when they jostle for cabs . </s>
<s> The Artist hangs out in Greenwich Village , on a strip of Sixth Avenue populated by jugglers , magicians and other good-natured hustlers . </s>
<s> -LRB- This clearly is not real life : no crack dealers , no dead-eyed men selling four-year-old copies of Cosmopolitan , no one curled up in a cardboard box . -RRB- </s>
<s> The Artist has his routine . </s>
<s> He spends his days sketching passers-by , or trying to . </s>
<s> At night he returns to the condemned building he calls home . </s>
<s> His life , including his skirmishes with a competing sketch artist , seems carefree . </s>
<s> He is his own man . </s>
<s> Then , just as the Tramp is given a blind girl to cure in `` City Lights , '' the Artist is put in charge of returning a two-year-old waif -LRB- Nicole Alysia -RRB- , whose father has been murdered by thugs , to her mother . </s>
<s> This cute child turns out to be a blessing and a curse . </s>
<s> She gives the Artist a sense of purpose , but also alerts him to the serious inadequacy of his vagrant life . </s>
<s> The beds at the Bowery Mission seem far drearier when he has to tuck a little girl into one of them at night . </s>
<s> To further load the stakes , Mr. Lane dreamed up a highly improbable romance for the Artist , with a young woman who owns her own children 's shop and who lives in an expensive high-rise apartment building . </s>
<s> This story line might resonate more strongly if Mr. Lane had as strong a presence in front of the camera as he does behind it . </s>
<s> Mr. Lane 's final purpose is n't to glamorize the Artist 's vagabond existence . </s>
<s> He has a point he wants to make , and he makes it , with a great deal of force . </s>
<s> The movie ends with sound , the sound of street people talking , and there is n't anything whimsical or enviable in those rough , beaten voices . </s>
<s> The French film maker Claude Chabrol has managed another kind of weird achievement with his `` Story of Women . '' </s>
<s> He has made a harsh , brilliant picture -- one that 's captivating -- about a character who , viewed from the most sympathetic angle , would seem disagreeable . </s>
<s> Yet this woman , Marie-Louise Giraud , carries historical significance , both as one of the last women to be executed in France and as a symbol of the Vichy government 's hypocrisy . </s>
<s> While Vichy collaborated with the Germans during World War II in the deaths of thousands of Resistance fighters and Jews , its officials needed a diversionary symbolic traitor . </s>
<s> Marie-Louise , a small-time abortionist , was their woman . </s>
<s> She became an abortionist accidentally , and continued because it enabled her to buy jam , cocoa and other war-rationed goodies . </s>
<s> She was untrained and , in one botched job killed a client . </s>
<s> Her remorse was shallow and brief . </s>
<s> Although she was kind and playful to her children , she was dreadful to her war-damaged husband ; she openly brought her lover into their home . </s>
<s> As presented by Mr. Chabrol , and played with thin-lipped intensity by Isabelle Huppert , Marie-Louise -LRB- called Marie Latour in the film -RRB- was not a nice person . </s>
<s> But she did n't deserve to have her head chopped off . </s>
<s> There is very little to recommend `` Old Gringo , '' a confused rendering of the Carlos Fuentes novel of the Mexican Revolution . </s>
<s> Most of the picture is taken up with endless scenes of many people either fighting or eating and drinking to celebrate victory . </s>
<s> I mention the picture only because many bad movies have a bright spot , and this one has Gregory Peck , in a marvelously loose and energetic portrayal of an old man who wants to die the way he wants to die . </s>
<s> Video Tip : Before seeing `` Sidewalk Stories , '' take a look at `` City Lights , '' Chaplin 's Tramp at his finest . </s>
