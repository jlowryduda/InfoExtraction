<s> While worry grows about big Japanese investments in the U.S. , Japan 's big trading companies are rapidly increasing their stake in America 's smaller business . </s>
<s> For Japan , the controversial trend improves access to American markets and technology . </s>
<s> But for small American companies , it also provides a growing source of capital and even marketing help . </s>
<s> Take the deal with Candela Laser Corp. , a Wayland , Mass. , manufacturer of high-tech medical devices , which three years ago set its sights on Japan as an export market . </s>
<s> Partly to help clear the myriad obstacles facing any overseas company trying to penetrate Japan , tiny Candela turned to Mitsui & Co. , one of Japan 's largest trading companies , for investment . </s>
<s> In a joint-venture deal , Mitsui guided Candela through Tokyo 's bureaucratic maze . </s>
<s> It eventually secured Ministry of Health import approval for two Candela laser products -- one that breaks up kidney stones and another that treats skin lesions . </s>
<s> At last count , Candela had sold $ 4 million of its medical devices in Japan . </s>
<s> The deal also gave Mitsui access to a high-tech medical product . </s>
<s> `` They view this as a growth area so they went about it with a systematic approach , '' says Richard Olsen , a Candela vice president . </s>
<s> Indeed , for many Japanese trading companies , the favorite U.S. small business is one whose research and development can be milked for future Japanese use . </s>
<s> The Japanese companies bankroll many small U.S. companies with promising products or ideas , frequently putting their money behind projects that commercial banks wo n't touch . </s>
<s> Japanese companies have financed small and medium-sized U.S. firms for years , but in recent months , the pace has taken off . </s>
<s> In the first half of 1989 alone , Japanese corporations invested $ 214 million in minority positions in U.S. companies , a 61 % rise from the figure for all of 1987 , reports Venture Economics Inc . </s>
<s> The Needham , Mass. , concern tracks investments in new businesses . </s>
<s> In addition , of course , some of the Japanese investments involved outright purchase of small U.S. firms . </s>
<s> Heightened Japanese interest in American small business parallels an acceleration of investments giving Japanese companies control of large , highly visible U.S. corporations , such as Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc . </s>
<s> Only this week , it was announced that Mitsubishi Estate Co. had acquired a 51 % stake in Rockefeller Group , which owns New York 's prestigious Rockefeller Center . </s>
<s> While the small deals are far less conspicuous , they add to Japanese penetration of the U.S. market . </s>
<s> As the deals also improve Japanese access to American technology and market knowledge , they feed American anxieties in this area , too . </s>
<s> Even a low-tech product like plate glass can catch a trading company 's fancy if there 's a strategic fit . </s>
<s> Free State Glass Industries of Warrenton , Va. , a small fabricator of architectural glass , was foundering under its original management . </s>
<s> Last year , Mitsubishi International Corp. , the New York-based arm of Mitsubishi Corp. , bought controlling interest in the glass company in a joint venture with Ronald Bodner , a glass industry executive and Mitsubishi consultant . </s>
<s> The deal is chiefly designed to give Mitsubishi a window on the U.S. glass industry , says Ichiro Wakui , an executive in Mitsubishi 's general merchandise department in New York . </s>
<s> `` It 's not just a simple investment in a small company , '' Mr. Wakui says . </s>
<s> `` We want to see the glass market from the inside , not the outside . '' </s>
<s> Mitsubishi 's investment in Free State is `` very small ... less than $ 4 million , '' Mr. Wakui says . </s>
<s> Mr. Bodner declines to comment on the arrangement . </s>
<s> Trading companies such as Mitsubishi , Mitsui , C. Itoh & Co. and Nissho-Iwai Corp. , which make many of the Japanese investments in small U.S. concerns , have no U.S. counterpart . </s>
<s> These vertically integrated combines , some of which got their start in Japan 's feudal period , deal globally in commodities , construction and manufacturing . </s>
<s> They operate ships and banks . </s>
<s> `` All the `` sogo-shosha '' are looking for new business , '' says Arthur Klauser , adviser to the president of Mitsui , U.S.A. , using the Japanese term for the largest of the global trading houses . </s>
<s> Adds Takeshi Kondo , senior vice president of C. Itoh America Inc. : `` We have a great interest in making investments , particularly in new ventures . '' </s>
<s> A host of electronics firms in California 's Silicon Valley were financed with trading-company venture capital . </s>
<s> Profit , at least in the short term , is usually a secondary goal . </s>
<s> `` Strategic objectives , not financial return , drive many of the deals , '' says a Venture Economics spokesman . </s>
<s> In investing on the basis of future transactions , a role often performed by merchant banks , trading companies can cut through the logjam that small-company owners often face with their local commercial banks . </s>
<s> `` It 's the classic problem of the small businessman , '' says Malcolm Davies , managing director of Trading Alliance Corp. of New York . </s>
<s> `` People are queuing at the door to take his product but he does n't have the working capital to make the thing and commercial banks are very unsympathetic . </s>
<s> They want assets , they want a balance sheet , which has no relation to the business a company can generate . '' </s>
<s> Adds Mitsui 's Mr. Klauser : `` Unlike corporations in this country , trading companies are n't so much interested in a high return on investment as they are on increasing trade flows . </s>
<s> To the extent they can do this , they 're quite content to get a return on investment of 1 % to 2 % . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Klauser says Mitsui has 75 U.S. subsidiaries in which it holds 35 % interest or more and the trading company hopes to double the number of its U.S. affiliates in 1990 . </s>
<s> Sales by these subsidiaries in the fiscal year ending last March were more than $ 17 billion . </s>
<s> A 1 % to 2 % return on $ 17 billion `` ai n't hay , '' Mr. Klauser says . </s>
