<s> Signs of a slowing economy are increasing pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates , but it is n't clear whether the central bank will do so . </s>
<s> A survey by the Fed 's 12 district banks shows economic growth has been sluggish in recent weeks , while upward pressures on prices have moderated . </s>
<s> `` The economy is clearly slowing , '' says Robert Black , president of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank . </s>
<s> `` If you look at the third quarter as posting roughly 2.5 % growth , I do see some slowing in the fourth quarter , '' agrees Kansas City Fed President Roger Guffey . </s>
<s> Nevertheless , both Mr. Guffey and Mr. Black say the slowdown so far is no cause for concern . </s>
<s> `` We 're coming closer to achieving the stated objective of slowing the economy to a point where hopefully some downward trend in prices will occur , '' said Mr. Guffey . </s>
<s> Bush administration officials are looking to the Fed to bring down rates , and financial markets seem to be expecting easier credit as well . </s>
<s> `` I think the market had been expecting the Fed to ease sooner and a little more than it has to date , '' said Robert Johnson , vice president of global markets for Bankers Trust Co . </s>
<s> The Fed cut the key federal funds interest rate by about 0.25 percentage point to 8.75 % after the Oct. 13 stock market plunge , but has shown no sign of movement since . </s>
<s> The report from the Fed found that manufacturing , in particular , has been weak in recent weeks . </s>
<s> The Philadelphia Fed , for instance , reported that manufacturing activity `` continues to decline '' for the fourth month in a row . </s>
<s> And in the Chicago district , the report said , `` a manufacturer of capital goods noted slower orders for some types , including defense equipment , petroleum equipment , food packaging machinery and material handling equipment . '' </s>
<s> Retail sales also were reported slow in most districts , particularly `` for discretionary , big-ticket items such as furniture , home appliances and consumer electronics . '' </s>
<s> And construction also was described as slow in most areas . </s>
<s> Despite the economic slowdown , there are few clear signs that growth is coming to a halt . </s>
<s> As a result , Fed officials may be divided over whether to ease credit . </s>
<s> Several Fed governors in Washington have been pushing for easier credit ; but many of the regional Fed presidents have been resisting such a move . </s>
<s> Mr. Black said he is `` pleased '' with the economy 's recent performance , and does n't see `` a lot of excesses out there that would tilt us into recession . '' </s>
<s> `` There is always a chance of recession , '' added Mr. Guffey , `` but if you ask me to put a percentage on it , I would think it 's well below a 50 % chance . </s>
