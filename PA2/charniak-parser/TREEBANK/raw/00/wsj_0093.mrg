<s> It was Richard Nixon 's first visit to China in 1972 that set in motion the historic rapprochement between Beijing and Washington . </s>
<s> But the former U.S. president 's sixth visit to China , during which he spoke at length with Chinese leaders , was nowhere near as successful at easing strains that have recently afflicted the Sino-U.S. relationship . </s>
<s> Mr. Nixon , the most prominent American to come to China since Beijing 's bloody suppression of pro-democracy demonstrators in June , harped on international outrage over the massacre . </s>
<s> The Chinese , in turn , took aim at American `` interference '' in China 's domestic affairs . </s>
<s> One official newspaper , Legal Daily , even directly criticized Mr. Nixon , who is normally referred to here as an `` old friend . '' </s>
<s> The paper accused him of being a leading proponent of `` peaceful evolution , '' a catch phrase to describe what China believes is the policy of Western countries to seduce socialist nations into the capitalist sphere . </s>
<s> The tension was evident on Wednesday evening during Mr. Nixon 's final banquet toast , normally an opportunity for reciting platitudes about eternal friendship . </s>
<s> Instead , Mr. Nixon reminded his host , Chinese President Yang Shangkun , that Americans have n't forgiven China 's leaders for the military assault of June 3-4 that killed hundreds , and perhaps thousands , of demonstrators . </s>
<s> `` Many in the United States , including many friends of China , believe the crackdown was excessive and unjustified , '' Mr. Nixon told Mr. Yang , who was directly involved in ordering the attack . </s>
<s> `` The events of April through June damaged the respect and confidence which most Americans previously had for the leaders of China . '' </s>
<s> The Chinese responded in an equally undiplomatic fashion . </s>
<s> In talks with Mr. Nixon , Chinese leaders expressed no regret for the killings , and even suggested that the U.S. was prominently involved in the demonstrations this spring . </s>
<s> In a meeting Tuesday , supreme leader , Deng Xiaoping , told Mr. Nixon , `` Frankly speaking , the U.S. was involved too deeply in the turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion which occurred in Beijing not long ago . </s>
<s> China was the real victim and it is unjust to reprove China for it . '' </s>
<s> Despite the harsh exchanges , the U.S. and China still seem to be looking for a way to mend relations , which have deteriorated into what Mr. Nixon referred to as `` the greatest crisis in Chinese-American relations '' since his initial visit to China 17 years ago . </s>
<s> In his return toast to Mr. Nixon , Mr. Yang said the relationship had reached a `` stalemate . '' </s>
<s> Relations between China and the U.S. have been tense since June 7 , when Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi and his wife , Li Shuxian , took refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing . </s>
<s> Shortly afterwards , Mr. Bush imposed a series of anti-China sanctions , including suspension of most high-level talks , which could be codified in U.S. congressional legislation in the coming weeks . </s>
<s> Mr. Nixon is traveling in China as a private citizen , but he has made clear that he is an unofficial envoy for the Bush administration . </s>
<s> Mr. Nixon met Mr. Bush and his national security adviser , Brent Scowcroft , before coming to China on Saturday . </s>
<s> And he plans to brief the president at the end of the week , U.S. sources said . </s>
<s> Mr. Nixon was to leave China today . </s>
<s> According to an American member of the Nixon party , the former president raised a number of controversial issues in his 20 hours of talks with top-level Chinese officials . </s>
<s> These included China 's economic policies , human rights and the question of Mr. Fang . </s>
<s> Mr. Nixon also proposed that China restore its participation in the Fulbright Program , a U.S. government-funded academic exchange . </s>
<s> China pulled out of the program in July . </s>
<s> In his talks , the former president urged China 's leaders to acknowledge that their nation is part of the world community and welcome the infusion of outside contacts and ideas . </s>
<s> `` Ideas are going over borders , and there 's no SDI ideological weapon that can shoot them down , '' he told a group of Americans at the U.S. Embassy on Wednesday . </s>
<s> There are no signs , however , of China 's yielding on key issues . </s>
<s> But in one minor matter , Mr. Nixon appears to have gained a concession . </s>
<s> In a meeting with Premier Li Peng on Monday , Mr. Nixon said that he hoped he would n't encounter guards with machine guns during his visit to the U.S. Embassy . </s>
<s> Sure enough , when he arrived at the embassy two days later , the machine-gun-toting guards were gone -- for the first time in five months . </s>
<s> A few blocks away , at the U.S. ambassador 's residence , the guards encircling the compound also had discarded their Uzi-model arms for the first time since early June . </s>
<s> But the guards there retained their pistols , and a large contingent of plainclothes police remained nearby in unmarked cars . </s>
<s> Moreover , police and soldiers continue to harass Americans , who have filed several protests with the Foreign Ministry in the past week . </s>
<s> Several times , Chinese guards have pointed their automatic rifles at young children of U.S. diplomats and clicked the trigger . </s>
<s> The rifles were n't loaded . </s>
