<s> Criticism in the U.S. over recent Japanese acquisitions is looming ever larger in the two countries ' relations . </s>
<s> Officials from both nations say the U.S. public 's skittishness about Japanese investment could color a second round of bilateral economic talks scheduled for next week in Washington . </s>
<s> Not that Washington and Tokyo disagree on the Japanese acquisitions ; indeed , each has come out in favor of unfettered investment in the U.S. . </s>
<s> Where they disagree is on the subject of U.S. direct investment in Japan . </s>
<s> The U.S. wants the removal of what it perceives as barriers to investment ; Japan denies there are real barriers . </s>
<s> The heated talk stirred up by recent Japanese investments in the U.S. is focusing attention on the differences in investment climate , even though it 's only one of many subjects to be covered in the bilateral talks , known as the Structural Impediments Initiative . </s>
<s> The Japanese `` should see this rhetoric as a signal of the need for a change in their own economy , '' says Charles Dallara , U.S. assistant Treasury secretary , who has been in Tokyo this week informally discussing the impending negotiations with government and business leaders . </s>
<s> `` We have a long history of maintaining an open direct-investment policy , '' Mr. Dallara says . </s>
<s> `` U.S. investors should have a greater opportunity at direct investment '' in Japan . </s>
<s> The Japanese fret openly about the U.S. public 's rancor . </s>
<s> One clear sign of Japan 's nervousness came this week , when a spokesman for Japan 's Foreign Ministry devoted nearly all of a regular , half-hour briefing for foreign journalists to the subject of recent Japanese investments in the U.S. . </s>
<s> `` We believe that it is vitally important for those Japanese business interests -LCB- in the U.S. . -RCB- to be more aware of the emotions and concerns of the American people , '' said the spokesman , Taizo Watanabe . </s>
<s> At the same time , though , he chastised the media for paying such close attention to Japanese investment when other foreign countries , notably Britain , are acquiring more American assets . </s>
<s> Fears that Japanese investors are buying up America have escalated sharply in the past several weeks , with Sony Corp. 's purchase of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. from Coca-Cola Co. and Mitsubishi Estate Co. 's acquisition of a 51 % holding in Rockefeller Group , the owner of some of midtown Manhattan 's most exclusive real estate . </s>
<s> Even before those moves added fuel , the fires of discontent had been well stoked by the highly publicized experience in Japan of one U.S. investor , T. Boone Pickens Jr . </s>
<s> The Texas oilman has acquired a 26.2 % stake valued at more than $ 1.2 billion in an automotive-lighting company , Koito Manufacturing Co . </s>
<s> But he has failed to gain any influence at the company . </s>
<s> Koito has refused to grant Mr. Pickens seats on its board , asserting he is a greenmailer trying to pressure Koito 's other shareholders into buying him out at a profit . </s>
<s> Mr. Pickens made considerable political hay with his troubles in Japan . </s>
<s> The Senate Finance Committee , chaired by a fellow Texan , Democratic Sen. Lloyd Bentsen , last month urged U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills to use Mr. Pickens 's experience in talks with Tokyo `` to highlight this problem facing Americans who seek access to the Japanese capital markets . '' </s>
<s> While Mr. Dallara and Japanese officials say the question of investors ' access to the U.S. and Japanese markets may get a disproportionate share of the public 's attention , a number of other important economic issues will be on the table at next week 's talks . </s>
<s> Among them are differences in savings and investment rates , corporate structures and management , and government spending . </s>
<s> Each side has a litany of recommendations for the other . </s>
<s> The U.S. says it is anxious for results . </s>
<s> `` We feel very strongly that we really need action across the full range of issues we 've identified , and we need it by next spring , '' Mr. Dallara says . </s>
<s> Both sides have agreed that the talks will be most successful if negotiators start by focusing on the areas that can be most easily changed . </s>
<s> But they have n't clarified what those might be . </s>
<s> After the first set of meetings two months ago , some U.S. officials complained that Japan had n't come up with specific changes it was prepared to make . </s>
<s> The Japanese retort that the first round was too early to make concessions . </s>
<s> `` Just to say the distribution system is wrong does n't mean anything , '' says a Ministry of International Trade and Industry official . </s>
<s> `` We need to clarify what exactly is wrong with it . '' </s>
<s> That process of sorting out specifics is likely to take time , the Japanese say , no matter how badly the U.S. wants quick results . </s>
<s> For instance , at the first meeting the two sides could n't even agree on basic data used in price discussions . </s>
<s> Since then , a team of about 15 MITI and U.S. Commerce Department officials have crossed the globe gauging consumer prices . </s>
<s> By Monday , they hope to have a sheaf of documents both sides can trust . </s>
<s> `` Little by little , there is progress , '' says the MITI official . </s>
<s> `` Both sides are taking action . '' </s>
