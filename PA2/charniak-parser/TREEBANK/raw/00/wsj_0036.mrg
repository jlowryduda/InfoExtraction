<s> In another reflection that the growth of the economy is leveling off , the government said that orders for manufactured goods and spending on construction failed to rise in September . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , the National Association of Purchasing Management said its latest survey indicated that the manufacturing economy contracted in October for the sixth consecutive month . </s>
<s> Its index inched up to 47.6 % in October from 46 % in September . </s>
<s> Any reading below 50 % suggests the manufacturing sector is generally declining . </s>
<s> The purchasing managers , however , also said that orders turned up in October after four months of decline . </s>
<s> Factories booked $ 236.74 billion in orders in September , nearly the same as the $ 236.79 billion in August , the Commerce Department said . </s>
<s> If not for a 59.6 % surge in orders for capital goods by defense contractors , factory orders would have fallen 2.1 % . </s>
<s> In a separate report , the department said construction spending ran at an annual rate of $ 415.6 billion , not significantly different from the $ 415.8 billion reported for August . </s>
<s> Private construction spending was down , but government building activity was up . </s>
<s> The figures in both reports were adjusted to remove the effects of usual seasonal patterns , but were n't adjusted for inflation . </s>
<s> Kenneth Mayland , economist for Society Corp. , a Cleveland bank , said demand for exports of factory goods is beginning to taper off . </s>
<s> At the same time , the drop in interest rates since the spring has failed to revive the residential construction industry . </s>
<s> `` What sector is stepping forward to pick up the slack ? '' he asked . </s>
<s> `` I draw a blank . '' </s>
<s> By most measures , the nation 's industrial sector is now growing very slowly -- if at all . </s>
<s> Factory payrolls fell in September . </s>
<s> So did the Federal Reserve Board 's industrial-production index . </s>
<s> Yet many economists are n't predicting that the economy is about to slip into recession . </s>
<s> They cite a lack of `` imbalances '' that provide early warning signals of a downturn . </s>
<s> Inventories are closely watched for such clues , for instance . </s>
<s> Economists say a buildup in inventories can provoke cutbacks in production that can lead to a recession . </s>
<s> But yesterday 's factory orders report had good news on that front : it said factory inventories fell 0.1 % in September , the first decline since February 1987 . </s>
<s> `` This conforms to the ` soft landing ' scenario , '' said Elliott Platt , an economist at Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp . </s>
<s> `` I do n't see any signs that inventories are excessive . '' </s>
<s> A soft landing is an economic slowdown that eases inflation without leading to a recession . </s>
<s> The department said orders for nondurable goods -- those intended to last fewer than three years -- fell 0.3 % in September to $ 109.73 billion after climbing 0.9 % the month before . </s>
<s> Orders for durable goods were up 0.2 % to $ 127.03 billion after rising 3.9 % the month before . </s>
<s> The department previously estimated that durable-goods orders fell 0.1 % in September . </s>
<s> Factory shipments fell 1.6 % to $ 234.4 billion after rising 5.4 % in August . </s>
<s> Shipments have been relatively level since January , the Commerce Department noted . </s>
<s> Manufacturers ' backlogs of unfilled orders rose 0.5 % in September to $ 497.34 billion , helped by strength in the defense capital goods sector . </s>
<s> Excluding these orders , backlogs declined 0.3 % . </s>
<s> In its construction spending report , the Commerce Department said residential construction , which accounts for nearly half of all construction spending , was off 0.9 % in September to an annual rate of $ 191.9 billion . </s>
<s> David Berson , economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association , predicted the drop in interest rates eventually will boost spending on single-family homes , but probably not until early next year . </s>
<s> Spending on private , nonresidential construction was off 2.6 % to an annual rate of $ 99.1 billion with no sector showing strength . </s>
<s> Government construction spending rose 4.3 % to $ 88 billion . </s>
<s> After adjusting for inflation , the Commerce Department said construction spending did n't change in September . </s>
<s> For the first nine months of the year , total construction spending ran about 2 % above last year 's level . </s>
<s> The government 's construction spending figures contrast with a report issued earlier in the week by McGraw-Hill Inc. 's F.W. Dodge Group . </s>
<s> Dodge reported an 8 % increase in construction contracts awarded in September . </s>
<s> The goverment counts money as it is spent ; Dodge counts contracts when they are awarded . </s>
<s> The government includes money spent on residential renovation ; Dodge does n't . </s>
<s> Although the purchasing managers ' index continues to indicate a slowing economy , it is n't signaling an imminent recession , said Robert Bretz , chairman of the association 's survey committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc. , Stamford , Conn . </s>
<s> He said the index would have to be in the low 40 % range for several months to be considered a forecast of recession . </s>
<s> The report offered new evidence that the nation 's export growth , though still continuing , may be slowing . </s>
<s> Only 19 % of the purchasing managers reported better export orders in October , down from 27 % in September . </s>
<s> And 8 % said export orders were down last month , compared with 6 % the month before . </s>
<s> The purhasing managers ' report also added evidence that inflation is under control . </s>
<s> For the fifth consecutive month , purchasing managers said prices for the goods they purchased fell . </s>
<s> The decline was even steeper than in September . </s>
<s> They also said that vendors were delivering goods more quickly in October than they had for each of the five previous months . </s>
<s> Economists consider that a sign that inflationary pressures are abating . </s>
<s> When demand is stronger than suppliers can handle and delivery times lengthen , prices tend to rise . </s>
<s> The purchasing managers ' report is based on data provided by more than 250 purchasing executives . </s>
<s> Each of the survey 's indicators gauges the difference between the number of purchasers reporting improvement in a particular area and the number reporting a worsening . </s>
<s> For the first time , the October survey polled members on imports . </s>
<s> It found that of the 73 % who import , 10 % said they imported more in October and 12 % said they imported less than the previous month . </s>
<s> While acknowledging one month 's figures do n't prove a trend , Mr. Bretz said , `` It does lead you to suspect imports are going down , or at least not increasing that much . '' </s>
<s> Items listed as being in short supply numbered only about a dozen , but they included one newcomer : milk and milk powder . </s>
<s> `` It 's an odd thing to put on the list , '' Mr. Bretz noted . </s>
<s> He said that for the second month in a row , food processors reported a shortage of nonfat dry milk . </s>
<s> They blamed increased demand for dairy products at a time of exceptionally high U.S. exports of dry milk , coupled with very low import quotas . </s>
