<s> The Chicago Mercantile Exchange said it plans to institute an additional `` circuit breaker '' aimed at stemming market slides . </s>
<s> Separately , John Phelan told a closed House subcommittee meeting in Washington that he would support Securities and Exchange Commission halts of program trading during market emergencies . </s>
<s> But the New York Stock Exchange chairman said he does n't support reinstating a `` collar '' on program trading , arguing that firms could get around such a limit . </s>
<s> The Chicago Merc said a new one-hour price limit would take effect in its Standard & Poor 's 500 stock-index futures pit once S&P 500 futures fell 20 index points -- the equivalent of about a 150-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average . </s>
<s> If the 20-point limit is triggered after 1:30 p.m . Chicago time , it would remain in effect until the normal close of trading at 3:15 p.m . </s>
<s> With the limit in effect , members would be able to execute trades at the limit price or at higher prices , but not below it . </s>
<s> The exchange said it decided a new circuit breaker was needed following a review of the tumultuous trading in stocks and stock-index futures on Friday Oct. 13 , when the Dow Jones industrials plunged 190 points and stock-index futures prices skidded as well . </s>
<s> Late that afternoon the S&P 500 stock-index futures contract fell a total of 30 index points , hitting a Merc circuit breaker limit that remained in effect for the rest of the trading session . </s>
<s> The Merc said that its existing 30-minute , 12-point limit on S&P 500 stock-index futures trading -LRB- equal to about 100 points on the Dow Jones industrials -RRB- , which was triggered Oct. 13 , will remain in effect . </s>
<s> Leo Melamed , Merc executive committee chairman , said that the 12-point limit appeared to lessen the selling panic Oct. 13 . </s>
<s> But when the contract reopened , the subsequent flood of sell orders that quickly knocked the contract down to the 30-point limit indicated that the intermediate limit of 20 points was needed to help keep stock and stock-index futures prices synchronized . </s>
<s> Several traders maintained that the Merc 's 12-point circuit-breaker aggravated the market slide Oct. 13 by directing additional selling pressure to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange . </s>
<s> All of the changes require regulatory approval , which is expected shortly . </s>
<s> The exchange also said that the 30-point circuit breaker , which currently provides only a one-hour respite during market sell-offs , will become the maximum one-day limit for the S&P 500 stock-index futures contract ; the one-day limit now is 50 index points . </s>
<s> A final modification was made to the five-point opening limit for the contract . </s>
<s> The Merc said that five-point limit will remain in effect for the first 10 minutes of trading . </s>
<s> The limit lapses under current exchange rules if contracts trade above the limit price during the opening 10 minutes of trading . </s>
<s> In Washington , House aides said Mr. Phelan told congressmen that the collar , which banned program trades through the Big Board 's computer when the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved 50 points , did n't work well . </s>
<s> He said that firms could get around the collar by executing trades manually . </s>
<s> In a post-hearing news conference , Mr. Phelan , who has publicly expressed concern about market volatility , said he told the House finance and telecommunications subcommittee that he would support the program-trading halt proposal `` providing the SEC would be comfortable with the language '' in a bill . </s>
<s> The program-trading issue is heating up on Capitol Hill as it is on Wall Street , and several legislators want to grant the SEC the power to shut off the programs when trading becomes too volatile . </s>
<s> SEC Chairman Richard Breeden has said he would be willing to consider circuit breakers that have preset trigger points , but he does n't want discretionary power to stop programs . </s>
<s> A House aide suggested that Mr. Phelan was so `` vague and mushy '' that it was the kind of meeting where people of all viewpoints could `` come out feeling good . '' </s>
<s> At one point , Mr. Phelan angered the subcommittee 's chairman , Rep. Edward Markey -LRB- D. , Mass. -RRB- , by not going much beyond what already had been reported in the morning newspapers . </s>
<s> `` Markey said we could have done this in public '' because so little sensitive information was disclosed , the aide said . </s>
<s> Mr. Phelan then responded that he would have been happy just writing a report to the panel , the aide added . </s>
<s> At another point during the hearing , Rep. Markey asked Mr. Phelan what would be discussed at a New York exchange board meeting today . </s>
<s> Mr. Phelan said the Big Board is likely to study the program-trading issue . </s>
<s> That response annoyed Rep. Markey , House aides said , and the congressman snapped back that there had been enough studies of the issue and that it was time for action on the matter . </s>
<s> Fifteen of the 26 subcommittee members attended the hearing , most notably Rep. John Dingell -LRB- D. , Mich. -RRB- , the full House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman , who has been willing to let Mr. Markey carry the legislation in recent months . </s>
<s> Mr. Dingell expressed concern , sources said , about jurisdictional problems in regulating program trading , which uses futures to offset stock trades . </s>
<s> The futures industry is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , which reports to the Agriculture committees in both houses . </s>
