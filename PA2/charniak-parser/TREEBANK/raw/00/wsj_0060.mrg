<s> `` The Cosby Show '' may have single-handedly turned around ratings at NBC since its debut in 1984 , and the Huxtable family still keeps millions of viewers laughing Thursday night on the network . </s>
<s> But some of the TV stations that bought `` Cosby '' reruns for record prices two years ago are n't laughing much these days . </s>
<s> The reruns have helped ratings at many of the 187 network affiliates and independent TV stations that air the shows . </s>
<s> But the ratings are considerably below expectations , and some stations say they may not buy new episodes when their current contracts expire . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , stations are fuming because , many of them say , the show 's distributor , Viacom Inc. , is giving an ultimatum : Either sign new long-term commitments to buy future episodes or risk losing `` Cosby '' to a competitor . </s>
<s> At the same time , Viacom is trying to persuade stations to make commitments to `` A Different World , '' a spin-off of `` Cosby '' whose reruns will become available in 1991 . </s>
<s> Viacom denies it 's using pressure tactics . </s>
<s> `` We 're willing to negotiate , '' says Dennis Gillespie , executive vice president of marketing . </s>
<s> `` We 're offering this plan now because we feel it 's the right time . '' </s>
<s> But , says the general manager of a network affiliate in the Midwest , `` I think if I tell them I need more time , they 'll take ` Cosby ' across the street , '' </s>
<s> Viacom 's move comes as the syndication market is being flooded with situation comedies that are still running on the networks . </s>
<s> One station manager says he believes Viacom 's move is a `` pre-emptive strike '' because the company is worried that `` Cosby '' ratings will continue to drop in syndication over the next few years . </s>
<s> `` Cosby '' is down a full ratings point in the week of Oct. 2-8 over the same week a year ago , according to A.C. Nielsen Co . </s>
<s> Mr. Gillespie at Viacom says the ratings are rising . </s>
<s> And executives at stations in such major markets as Washington ; Providence , R.I. ; Cleveland ; Raleigh , N.C. ; Minneapolis , and Louisville , Ky. , say they may very well not renew `` Cosby . '' </s>
<s> Dick Lobo , the general manager of WTVJ , the NBC-owned station in Miami , for example , says the show has `` been a major disappointment to us . '' </s>
<s> `` At the prices we were charged , there should have been some return for the dollar . </s>
<s> There was n't . '' </s>
<s> Neil Kuvin , the general manager of WHAS , the CBS affiliate in Louisville , says `` Cosby '' gets the station 's highest ratings and he 's `` pleased . '' </s>
<s> But he adds , `` I feel pressured , disappointed , uncomfortable and , frankly , quite angry with Viacom . </s>
