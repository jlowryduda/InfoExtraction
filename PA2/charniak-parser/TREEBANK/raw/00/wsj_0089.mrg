<s> The art of change-ringing is peculiar to the English , and , like most English peculiarities , unintelligible to the rest of the world . </s>

<s> ASLACTON , England </s>
<s> -- Of all scenes that evoke rural England , this is one of the loveliest : An ancient stone church stands amid the fields , the sound of bells cascading from its tower , calling the faithful to evensong . </s>
<s> The parishioners of St. Michael and All Angels stop to chat at the church door , as members here always have . </s>
<s> In the tower , five men and women pull rhythmically on ropes attached to the same five bells that first sounded here in 1614 . </s>
<s> But there is also a discordant , modern note in Aslacton , though it ca n't be heard by the church-goers enjoying the peal of bells this cool autumn evening . </s>
<s> Like most of the other 6,000 churches in Britain with sets of bells , St. Michael once had its own `` band '' of ringers , who would herald every Sunday morning and evening service . </s>
<s> Now , only one local ringer remains : 64-year-old Derek Hammond . </s>
<s> The others here today live elsewhere . </s>
<s> They belong to a group of 15 ringers -- including two octogenarians and four youngsters in training -- who drive every Sunday from church to church in a sometimes-exhausting effort to keep the bells sounding in the many belfries of East Anglia . </s>
<s> `` To ring for even one service at this tower , we have to scrape , '' says Mr. Hammond , a retired water-authority worker . </s>
<s> `` We 've tried to train the youngsters , but they have their discos and their dances , and they just drift away . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Hammond worries that old age and the flightiness of youth will diminish the ranks of the East Anglian group that keeps the Aslacton bells pealing . </s>
<s> History , after all , is not on his side . </s>
<s> According to a nationwide survey taken a year ago , nearly a third of England 's church bells are no longer rung on Sundays because there is no one to ring them . </s>
<s> It is easy to see why the ancient art is on the ropes . </s>
<s> The less complicated version of playing tunes on bells , as do the carillons of continental Europe , is considered by the English to be childish , fit only for foreigners . </s>
<s> Change-ringing , a mind-boggling exercise the English invented 380 years ago , requires physical dexterity -- some bells weigh more than a ton -- combined with intense mental concentration . </s>
<s> Proper English bells are started off in `` rounds , '' from the highest-pitched bell to the lowest -- a simple descending scale using , in larger churches , as many as 12 bells . </s>
<s> Then , at a signal , the ringers begin varying the order in which the bells sound without altering the steady rhythm of the striking . </s>
<s> Each variation , or change , can occur only once , the rules state . </s>
<s> Ringers memorize patterns of changes , known as `` methods , '' which have odd-sounding names like Kent Treble Bob Major or Grandsire Caters . </s>
<s> A series of 5,000 or so changes is a `` peal '' and takes about three hours . </s>
<s> A look at a Thursday night practice at St. Mary Abbot church in the Kensington district of London gives an idea of the work involved . </s>
<s> Ten shirt-sleeved ringers stand in a circle , one foot ahead of the other in a prize-fighter 's stance , each pulling a rope that disappears through a small hole in the high ceiling of the ringing chamber . </s>
<s> No one speaks , and the snaking of the ropes seems to make as much sound as the bells themselves , muffled by the ceiling . </s>
<s> Totally absorbed , the ringers stare straight ahead , using peripheral vision -LRB- they call it `` rope-sight '' -RRB- to watch the other ropes and thus time their pulls . </s>
<s> Far above in the belfry , the huge bronze bells , mounted on wheels , swing madly through a full 360 degrees , starting and ending , surprisingly , in the inverted , or mouth-up position . </s>
<s> Skilled ringers use their wrists to advance or retard the next swing , so that one bell can swap places with another in the following change . </s>
<s> In a well-known detective-story involving church bells , English novelist Dorothy L. Sayers described ringing as a `` passion -LCB- that -RCB- finds its satisfaction in mathematical completeness and mechanical perfection . '' </s>
<s> Ringers , she added , are `` filled with the solemn intoxication that comes of intricate ritual faultlessly performed . '' </s>
<s> `` Ringing does become a bit of an obsession , '' admits Stephanie Pattenden , master of the band at St. Mary Abbot and one of England 's best female ringers . </s>
<s> It is a passion that usually stays in the tower , however . </s>
<s> More often than not , ringers think of the church as something stuck on the bottom of the belfry . </s>
<s> When their changes are completed , and after they have worked up a sweat , ringers often skip off to the local pub , leaving worship for others below . </s>
<s> This does not sit well with some clerics . </s>
<s> With membership of the Church of England steadily dwindling , strong-willed vicars are pressing equally strong-willed and often non-religious ringers to attend services . </s>
<s> Two years ago , the Rev. Jeremy Hummerstone , vicar of Great Torrington , Devon , got so fed up with ringers who did n't attend service he sacked the entire band ; the ringers promptly set up a picket line in protest . </s>
<s> `` They were a self-perpetuating club that treated the tower as sort of a separate premises , '' the Vicar Hummerstone says . </s>
<s> An entirely new band rings today at Great Torrington , several of whom are members of the congregation . </s>
<s> But there still are n't enough ringers to ring more than six of the eight bells . </s>
<s> At St. Mary 's Church in Ilminster , Somerset , the bells have fallen silent following a dust-up over church attendance . </s>
<s> The vicar , W.D. Jones , refuses to talk about it , saying it would `` reopen the wound . '' </s>
<s> But C.J.B. Marshall , vicar of a nearby church , feels the fault is in the stairs from the bell tower that are located next to the altar . </s>
<s> `` So crunch , crunch , crunch , bang , bang , bang -- here come the ringers from above , making a very obvious exit while the congregation is at prayer , '' he says . </s>
<s> Vicar Marshall admits to mixed feelings about this issue , since he is both a vicar and an active bell-ringer himself . </s>
<s> `` The sound of bells is a net to draw people into the church , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` I live in hopes that the ringers themselves will be drawn into that fuller life . '' </s>
<s> The Central Council of Church Bell Ringers , a sort of parliament of ringing groups , aims to improve relations with vicars , says John C. Baldwin , president . </s>
<s> It hopes to speak to students at theological colleges about the joys of bell ringing and will shortly publish a booklet for every vicar in the country entitled , `` The Bells in Your Care . '' </s>
<s> Says Mr. Baldwin , `` We recognize that we may no longer have as high a priority in church life and experience . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Baldwin is also attacking the greater problem : lack of ringers . </s>
<s> One survey says that of the 100,000 trained bellringers in England today , only 40,000 of them still ring . </s>
<s> Also , ringers do n't always live where the bells need to be rung -- like in small , rural parishes and inner-city churches . </s>
<s> But the council 's program to attract and train ringers is only partly successful , says Mr. Baldwin . </s>
<s> `` Right now , we 're lucky if after five years we keep one new ringer out of 10 , '' he adds . </s>
<s> One bright sign is that a growing number of women have entered the once male-dominated field ; more than a third of the ringers today are women . </s>
<s> They are n't accepted everywhere , however . </s>
<s> The oldest bell-ringing group in the country , the Ancient Society of College Youths , founded in 1637 , remains male-only , a fact that 's particularly galling to women because the group is the sole source of ringers for Britain 's most prestigious churches , St. Paul 's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey . </s>
<s> This being Britain , no woman has filed an equal-opportunity suit , but the extent of the problem surfaced this summer in a series of letters to `` The Ringing World , '' a weekly newspaper for ringers . </s>
<s> One writer , signing his letter as `` Red-blooded , balanced male , '' remarked on the `` frequency of women fainting in peals , '' and suggested that they `` settle back into their traditional role of making tea at meetings . '' </s>
<s> In the torrent of replies that followed , one woman ringer from Solihull observed that `` the average male ringer leaves quite a lot to be desired : badly dressed , decorated with acne and a large beer-belly , frequently unwashed and unbearably flatulent in peals . '' </s>
<s> Another women wrote from Sheffield to say that in her 60 years of ringing , `` I have never known a lady to faint in the belfry . </s>
<s> I have seen one or two men die , bless them . </s>
