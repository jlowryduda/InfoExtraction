<s> Judging from the Americana in Haruki Murakami 's `` A Wild Sheep Chase '' -LRB- Kodansha , 320 pages , $ 18.95 -RRB- , baby boomers on both sides of the Pacific have a lot in common . </s>
<s> Although set in Japan , the novel 's texture is almost entirely Western , especially American . </s>
<s> Characters drink Salty Dogs , whistle `` Johnny B. Goode '' and watch Bugs Bunny reruns . </s>
<s> They read Mickey Spillane and talk about Groucho and Harpo . </s>
<s> They worry about their careers , drink too much and suffer through broken marriages and desultory affairs . </s>
<s> This is Japan ? </s>
<s> For an American reader , part of the charm of this engaging novel should come in recognizing that Japan is n't the buttoned-down society of contemporary American lore . </s>
<s> It 's also refreshing to read a Japanese author who clearly does n't belong to the self-aggrandizing `` we-Japanese '' school of writers who perpetuate the notion of the unique Japanese , unfathomable by outsiders . </s>
<s> If `` A Wild Sheep Chase '' carries an implicit message for international relations , it 's that the Japanese are more like us than most of us think . </s>
<s> That 's not to say that the nutty plot of `` A Wild Sheep Chase '' is rooted in reality . </s>
<s> It 's imaginative and often funny . </s>
<s> A disaffected , hard-drinking , nearly-30 hero sets off for snow country in search of an elusive sheep with a star on its back at the behest of a sinister , erudite mobster with a Stanford degree . </s>
<s> He has in tow his prescient girlfriend , whose sassy retorts mark her as anything but a docile butterfly . </s>
<s> Along the way , he meets a solicitous Christian chauffeur who offers the hero God 's phone number ; and the Sheep Man , a sweet , roughhewn figure who wears -- what else -- a sheepskin . </s>
<s> The 40-year-old Mr. Murakami is a publishing sensation in Japan . </s>
<s> A more recent novel , `` Norwegian Wood '' -LRB- every Japanese under 40 seems to be fluent in Beatles lyrics -RRB- , has sold more than four million copies since Kodansha published it in 1987 . </s>
<s> But he is just one of several youthful writers -- Tokyo 's brat pack -- who are dominating the best-seller charts in Japan . </s>
<s> Their books are written in idiomatic , contemporary language and usually carry hefty dashes of Americana . </s>
<s> In Robert Whiting 's `` You Gotta Have Wa '' -LRB- Macmillan , 339 pages , $ 17.95 -RRB- , the Beatles give way to baseball , in the Nipponese version we would be hard put to call a `` game . '' </s>
<s> As Mr. Whiting describes it , Nipponese baseball is a `` mirror of Japan 's fabled virtues of hard work and harmony . '' </s>
<s> `` Wa '' is Japanese for `` team spirit '' and Japanese ballplayers have miles and miles of it . </s>
<s> A player 's commitment to practice and team image is as important as his batting average . </s>
<s> Polls once named Tokyo Giants star Tatsunori Hara , a `` humble , uncomplaining , obedient soul , '' as the male symbol of Japan . </s>
<s> But other than the fact that besuboru is played with a ball and a bat , it 's unrecognizable : Fans politely return foul balls to stadium ushers ; the strike zone expands depending on the size of the hitter ; ties are permitted -- even welcomed -- since they honorably sidestep the shame of defeat ; players must abide by strict rules of conduct even in their personal lives -- players for the Tokyo Giants , for example , must always wear ties when on the road . </s>
<s> `` You Gotta Have Wa '' is the often amusing chronicle of how American ballplayers , rationed to two per team , fare in Japan . </s>
<s> Despite the enormous sums of money they 're paid to stand up at a Japanese plate , a good number decide it 's not worth it and run for home . </s>
<s> `` Funny Business '' -LRB- Soho , 228 pages , $ 17.95 -RRB- by Gary Katzenstein is anything but . </s>
<s> It 's the petulant complaint of an impudent American whom Sony hosted for a year while he was on a Luce Fellowship in Tokyo -- to the regret of both parties . </s>
<s> In sometimes amusing , more often supercilious , even vicious passages , Mr. Katzenstein describes how Sony invades even the most mundane aspects of its workers ' lives -- at the regimented office , where employees are assigned lunch partners -- and at `` home '' in the austere company dormitory run by a prying caretaker . </s>
<s> Some of his observations about Japanese management style are on the mark . </s>
<s> It 's probably true that many salarymen put in unproductive overtime just for the sake of solidarity , that the system is so hierarchical that only the assistant manager can talk to the manager and the manager to the general manager , and that Sony was chary of letting a young , short-term American employee take on any responsibility . </s>
<s> All of this must have been enormously frustrating to Mr. Katzenstein , who went to Sony with degrees in business and computer science and was raring to invent another Walkman . </s>
<s> But Sony ultimately took a lesson from the American management books and fired Mr. Katzenstein , after he committed the social crime of making an appointment to see the venerable Akio Morita , founder of Sony . </s>
<s> It 's a shame their meeting never took place . </s>
<s> Mr. Katzenstein certainly would have learned something , and it 's even possible Mr. Morita would have too . </s>

<s> In Seoul , officials began visiting about 26,000 cigarette stalls to remove illegal posters and signboards advertising imported cigarettes . </s>

<s> A marketing study indicates that Hong Kong consumers are the most materialistic in the 14 major markets where the survey was carried out . </s>
<s> The study by the Backer Spielvogel Bates ad agency also found that the colony 's consumers feel more pressured than those in any of the other surveyed markets , which include the U.S. and Japan . </s>
<s> The survey found that nearly half of Hong Kong consumers espouse what it identified as materialistic values , compared with about one-third in Japan and the U.S. . </s>
<s> More than three in five said they are under a great deal of stress most of the time , compared with less than one in two U.S. consumers and one in four in Japan . </s>
<s> The Thai cabinet endorsed Finance Minister Pramual Sabhavasu 's proposal to build a $ 19 million conference center for a joint meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund two years from now . </s>
<s> The meeting , which is expected to draw 20,000 to Bangkok , was going to be held at the Central Plaza Hotel , but the government balked at the hotel 's conditions for undertaking necessary expansion . </s>
<s> A major concern about the current plan is whether the new center can be built in such a short time . </s>

<s> The man had for a long time had `` a chaotic sex life , '' including relations with foreign men , the newspaper said . </s>
<s> The Polish government increased home electricity charges by 150 % and doubled gas prices . </s>

<s> In a victory for environmentalists , Hungary 's parliament terminated a multibillion-dollar River Danube dam being built by Austrian firms . </s>
<s> The Nagymaros dam was designed to be twinned with another dam , now nearly complete , 100 miles upstream in Czechoslovakia . </s>
<s> In ending Hungary 's part of the project , Parliament authorized Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth to modify a 1977 agreement with Czechoslovakia , which still wants the dam to be built . </s>
<s> Mr. Nemeth said in parliament that Czechoslovakia and Hungary would suffer environmental damage if the twin dams were built as planned . </s>
<s> Czechoslovakia said in May it could seek $ 2 billion from Hungary if the twindam contract were broken . </s>
