<s> Japanese investors nearly single-handedly bought up two new mortgage securities-based mutual funds totaling $ 701 million , the U.S. Federal National Mortgage Association said . </s>
<s> The purchases show the strong interest of Japanese investors in U.S. mortgage-based instruments , Fannie Mae 's chairman , David O. Maxwell , said at a news conference . </s>
<s> He said more than 90 % of the funds were placed with Japanese institutional investors . </s>
<s> The rest went to investors from France and Hong Kong . </s>
<s> Earlier this year , Japanese investors snapped up a similar , $ 570 million mortgage-backed securities mutual fund . </s>
<s> That fund was put together by Blackstone Group , a New York investment bank . </s>
<s> The latest two funds were assembled jointly by Goldman , Sachs & Co. of the U.S. and Japan 's Daiwa Securities Co . </s>
<s> The new , seven-year funds -- one offering a fixed-rate return and the other with a floating-rate return linked to the London interbank offered rate -- offer two key advantages to Japanese investors . </s>
<s> First , they are designed to eliminate the risk of prepayment -- mortgage-backed securities can be retired early if interest rates decline , and such prepayment forces investors to redeploy their money at lower rates . </s>
<s> Second , they channel monthly mortgage payments into semiannual payments , reducing the administrative burden on investors . </s>
<s> By addressing those problems , Mr. Maxwell said , the new funds have become `` extremely attractive to Japanese and other investors outside the U.S. . '' </s>
<s> Such devices have boosted Japanese investment in mortgage-backed securities to more than 1 % of the $ 900 billion in such instruments outstanding , and their purchases are growing at a rapid rate . </s>
<s> They also have become large purchasers of Fannie Mae 's corporate debt , buying $ 2.4 billion in Fannie Mae bonds during the first nine months of the year , or almost a tenth of the total amount issued . </s>
