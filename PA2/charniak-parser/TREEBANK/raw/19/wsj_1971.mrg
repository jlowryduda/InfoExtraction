<s> Steve Jobs took a step back from the frontier of personal-computer technology in an effort to spur sales of Next Inc. 's new machine . </s>
<s> Mr. Jobs moved to remedy a couple of his computer 's drawbacks yesterday by lowering the entry-level price for a Next machine by $ 1,500 , or 23 % , if the buyer chooses a hard-disk drive as an alternative to Next 's optical-storage device . </s>
<s> The hard drive , which is the storage device of choice for virtually every desktop computer user , also now will supplement Next 's futuristic optical device if buyers pay full price . </s>
<s> Mr. Jobs , co-founder of Apple Computer Inc. , founded Next four years ago in the hopes of fomenting a revolution in the way desktop computers are designed and used . </s>
<s> His Next computer , introduced about a year ago and aimed primarily at university computer users , sports snazzy graphics , digital sound , built-in networking and a sleek black design . </s>
<s> But the computer was proving a hard sell because of its high price , a lack of software and an optical data-storage device that was too slow . </s>
<s> The machine began shipping at the end of last year . </s>
<s> The closely held company has n't disclosed sales . </s>
<s> However , most universities that have bought the machines say they are buying small numbers for evaluation purposes . </s>
<s> Universities can now buy a Next computer without an optical storage device for $ 4,995 . </s>
<s> A computer with the optical device will still cost $ 6,495 , but from now on Next will outfit every computer with a hard drive and supply one at no cost to those who have already bought Next machines . </s>
<s> Commercial customers can purchase the same system through Businessland Inc. , a computer retailer based in San Jose , Calif. , for roughly $ 3,000 more . </s>
<s> Mr. Jobs said the changes were prompted by requests from customers who are frustrated with the performance of the optical device , which is n't offered as standard equipment by any rivals . </s>
<s> Another factor was that customers were asking , `` Why do n't you give us a cheaper system ? '' Mr. Jobs said at a conference on university computing here . </s>
<s> Optical-storage devices can handle very large amounts of data and make it far easier to edit film clips or audio recordings with a computer . </s>
<s> But the technology , while reliable , is far slower than the widely used hard drives . </s>
<s> To get around the delays caused by the optical device , Businessland , which is Next 's exclusive dealer to corporations , has for months been advising customers to purchase hard drives with the machines . </s>
<s> Next 's decision to rely on the more-established hard drive in every Next computer does n't signal a retreat from optical storage , said Mr. Jobs , who for years has said this technology will play a crucial role in the next decade . </s>
<s> `` We 're extremely committed to optical storage technology '' he said . </s>
<s> `` We think everything will go this way in a few years . '' </s>
<s> He said that the next generation of optical drives will be as fast as hard drives , but he depends on outside suppliers for the devices . </s>
<s> But university computer specialists , who welcomed the move , called it a necessary retreat from the cutting edge of technology and one that 's likely to increase Next 's sales on campuses . </s>
<s> `` From the standpoint of being on the forefront of technology , this is a step backward , '' said Jerry W. Sprecher , a senior computing manager for the California state university system . </s>
<s> `` But it will definitely boost Next 's sales . '' </s>
<s> Universities , however , say Next 's prices must go even lower before large numbers of students purchase the machine . </s>
<s> `` We 'd still like to see a student model , '' priced at about $ 3,500 , said Ronald Johnson , director of academic computing at Minnesota 's Gustavus Adolphus College , which has bought eight Next machines . </s>
<s> Broad acceptance of Next 's computer also is hindered by difficulty in distributing software for it . </s>
<s> Most software is distributed on cheap floppy disks , but the Next computer does n't come with a device that reads them . </s>
<s> Next 's computer also needs more software applications , but Mr. Jobs said he expects more soon . </s>
<s> He said he expects Lotus Development Corp. to introduce a Next version of its popular 1-2-3 spreadsheet program in 1990 . </s>
<s> Educators added that Next needs to soon offer a color version of its computer . </s>
<s> Every major maker offers computers with color displays . </s>
<s> Next wo n't comment on when it will do the same , but is believed to have a color model under development . </s>
