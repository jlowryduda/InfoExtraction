<s> South Africa negotiated a new debt agreement with its major foreign creditors for about $ 8 billion of its foreign debt outstanding , said Chris Stals , governor of the Reserve Bank and the country 's chief debt negotiator . </s>
<s> The new agreement will last for 3 1\/2 years starting July 1 , 1990 , when the current agreement expires . </s>
<s> The announcement coincides with the start of the Commonwealth Ministers Conference in Kuala Lumpur , where proposals for renewed sanctions against South Africa , including moves to block settling of a new debt agreement , were scheduled to be discussed . </s>
<s> As with the previous pact , the new agreement covers the country 's debt `` inside the net , '' which applies mainly to repayments due to overseas creditor banks by the private sector . </s>
<s> The agreement calls for South African debtors to make repayments in eight installments , starting in December of next year . </s>
<s> The redemption then would be at 1.5 % of the total debt , increasing to 2.5 % in February 1991 , and to 3 % at six-month intervals thereafter . </s>
<s> A revised provision would be included for the conversion of short-term claims inside the net to long-term loans outside the net . </s>
<s> These claims would be repayable over a 10-year period . </s>
<s> Foreign debt falling outside the net of affected indebtedness -- which Mr. Stahl estimated at $ 12 billion -- would remain not subject to the debt arrangements . </s>
