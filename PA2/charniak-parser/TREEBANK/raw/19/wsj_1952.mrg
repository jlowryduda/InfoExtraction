<s> Just after midnight Monday , federal spending started to drop by $ 16 billion . </s>
<s> What do you say we all close down the poker game , go home and bank the $ 16 billion ? </s>
<s> That 's essentially what budget director Richard Darman is suggesting , and we think he deserves as much support as he can get . </s>
<s> If human beings ca n't cut federal spending honestly -- and they ca n't -- let the computers do it . </s>
<s> Congress , with a measure of White House complicity , has been manipulating the spending accounts for years under the cover of omnibus appropriations bills . </s>
<s> -LRB- Indeed without earlier manipulations , the current sequester of $ 16 billion would have been even larger . -RRB- </s>
<s> We suspect voters are fed up with the finagling . </s>
<s> Consider , for instance , that even yesterday 's widely publicized sequester is likely to be traduced if business as usual is allowed to prevail . </s>
<s> Under the law , Gramm-Rudman 's across-the-board-cuts in federal programs are supposed to be permanent . </s>
<s> Social Security and spending for poor people are exempted . </s>
<s> However , the Associated Press 's account of the Monday sequester order signed by President Bush neatly captured the contempt Congress shows toward the notion of a legally binding commitment : </s>
<s> `` Lawmakers have been saying for weeks that they plan to roll back the cuts as soon as they agree to a compromise on a deficit-cutting bill . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Darman 's inclination to save the sequester was backed up yesterday by White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater : </s>
<s> `` There is some feeling here that the cuts are the way to go . </s>
<s> It will reduce spending in a very effective fashion . '' </s>
<s> This attitude is being waved away by sophisticates around Washington as little more than tough talk . </s>
<s> It looks to us like a golden opportunity for George Bush to chop off at the knees all this talk about a timid , unserious presidency . </s>
<s> Mr. Bush would be acting in the public interest if he let the Washington elites who manipulate these budgets -- the bureaucrats , the lobbyists , the congressional staffers -- live for just one year on a restricted diet . </s>
<s> Ask Tommy Lasorda ; thin is in . </s>
<s> Senator Phil Gramm pointed out Monday that in the 20 years before Gramm-Rudman was enacted in 1985 , federal spending grew by about 11 % a year ; since the law , it 's grown at under 5 % annually . </s>
<s> Another major factor in this positive trend was Ronald Reagan 's decision early in his presidency to fight the budget war on the expenditure side rather than raising taxes . </s>
<s> George Bush 's continued support of the tax dam sustains this strategy of pressuring Congress to make choices among competing priorities , rather than just saying yes to all the grateful special-interest constituencies that fill the PAC trough . </s>
<s> If Washington 's elites ever succeed in bursting the tax dam , Americans will be engulfed in a red sea of new spending programs , such as federalized child care . </s>
<s> Child care was one of the many `` extraneous '' bills pulled out of the Senate 's reconciliation bill last Friday . </s>
<s> Others were the capital-gains cut , Section 89 repeal , the disabled workers bill , and the unprecedented reconsideration of the catastrophic health act . </s>
<s> All this stuff still is in the House 's 1,878-page reconciliation bill , and many Members say they 're reluctant to pull out cherished bills , just to see them die . </s>
<s> Republicans especially want a guarantee from the House leadership that they 'll get an up-or-down vote on the bills . </s>
<s> House Speaker Foley ought to deliver that promise . </s>
<s> This is the way government is supposed to work , with politicians taking responsibility for votes that their constituents can identify , instead of concealing them in the great reconciliation garbage truck . </s>
<s> We have as much nostalgia as anyone for those leafy , breezy days in Washington when honorable men and women dickered over budgets and even log-rolled a bit to see that the bridges got build , roads paved , soldiers paid or that the desperately poor were cared for . </s>
<s> Those days are gone . </s>
<s> Nor do we see any reason to believe that a metropolitan Washington that has gotten fat and rich and lazy in the shadow of the federal colossus will change much on its own initiative . </s>
<s> Save the sequester , and let Washington scream . </s>
