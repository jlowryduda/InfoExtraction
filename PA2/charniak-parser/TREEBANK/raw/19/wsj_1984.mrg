<s> I approached `` Mastergate , '' Larry Gelbart 's new comedy at the Criterion Center , with considerable trepidation . </s>
<s> Nothing , I assumed , would be more hopelessly dated than a political satire on the Iran-Contra affair . </s>
<s> I had underestimated , however , both Mr. Gelbart 's wit and the persistence of scandal in Washington . </s>
<s> Though the play clearly is framed around the events of Iran-Contra , it takes in the wide sweep of scandals over the past 30 years . </s>
<s> In fact , at one point Merry Chase -LRB- Melinda Mullins -RRB- , a cool , carefully coiffed television announcer , recites a list of a dozen or more scandals of recent years , concluding with those affecting the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the savings and loan industry . </s>
<s> Onstage , a congressional hearing is in progress , complete with elegant crystal chandelier overhead and a lifesize reproduction of the signing of the Constitution in the background . </s>
<s> The witness table is center stage and below it , the paraphernalia for the ever-present media , in this case TNN , the Total News Network . </s>
<s> Not only are there camera operators on all sides , but the proceedings are shown on monitors throughout the theater . </s>
<s> The metaphor of theater is not entirely coincidental . </s>
<s> Mr. Gelbart clearly feels that all the participants in a congressional hearing -- the witnesses , the lawyers , the interrogators and the news media -- are performers . </s>
<s> As the story of `` Mastergate '' unfolds , we learn that the Internal Revenue Service confiscated one of the properties of a foreign financier who owes the government millions in taxes . </s>
<s> The man , it seems , has a Lichtenstein corporation , licensed in Libya and sheltered in the Bahamas . </s>
<s> He himself lives in a `` consecutive series of unnumbered houses in a town in Switzerland . '' </s>
<s> The property seized by the IRS is a Hollywood film studio , Master Pictures Incorporated -LRB- MPI -RRB- . </s>
<s> Supposedly the IRS will sell off the assets of MPI , but before it can , a lowly IRS agent is called into the hospital room of Wylie Slaughter , the dying head of the Central Intelligence Agency . </s>
<s> The lowly agent , Abel Lamb , who as you might guess , is being led to the slaughter , is ordered to take over the studio . </s>
<s> Soon the studio is producing a $ 40 million picture called `` Tet , the Motion Picture , '' to distinguish it from `` Tet , the Offensive , '' as well as `` Tet , the Book '' and `` Tet , the Album . '' </s>
<s> The picture , to be made in the Central American country of San Elvador , is a cover for sending $ 800 million of arms to Los Otros , the rebel group attempting to regain neighboring Ambigua , which has been taken over by the leftist dictator Dr. Overtega , a former podiatrist , who leads a revolutionary band of foot soldiers . </s>
<s> The man handling all this for the now-deceased Slaughter is Major Manley Battle , Mr. Gelbart 's stand in for Col. Oliver North . </s>
<s> Director Michael Engler has assembled a top-flight cast to carry out the impersonations of well-known political figures and to play the stock characters who invariably show up at congressional hearings . </s>
<s> Daniel von Bargen is ramrod-stiff but totally assured as Major Battle , mixing just the right brand of self-righteousness and patriotism ; Jeff Weiss is fire , brimstone and teary-eyed emotionalism as the far-right senator who serves as a friendly interrogator of Major Battle ; Zach Grenier is maddeningly officious playing a succession of lawyers ; Joseph Daly has the perfect `` aw , shucks '' demeanor of George Bush in his portrayal of the vice president ; and Ann McDonough is first-rate as a succession of witnesses ' wives . </s>
<s> With one she is pregnant , with Major Battle she is knitting an American flag , and as the vice president 's wife she rushes in with white hair , wearing a tailored suit and pearls , imitating Barbara Bush 's gestures down to the last detail . </s>
<s> Though it 's clear that Mr. Gelbart 's sympathies do not lie with the far right , it 's also true that he is evenhanded in dispensing his satirical jabs , taking sharp aim at senators and congressmen of all stripes and particularly at the media . </s>
<s> Mr. Gelbart also has fun with language . </s>
<s> `` Mastergate '' is subtitled `` a play on words , '' and Mr. Gelbart plays that game as well as anyone . </s>
<s> He describes a Mastergate flunky as one who experienced a `` meteoric disappearance '' and found himself `` handling blanket appeals at the Bureau of Indian Affairs . '' </s>
<s> This interest in words goes beyond puns and playfulness , however . </s>
<s> Mr. Gelbart deplores the obfuscation , the circumlocution and the debasement of language he sees on all sides . </s>
<s> As the hearings begin , the self-important Sen. Bowman -LRB- Jerome Kilty -RRB- announces : `` Let me emphaticize one thing at the outset : We are not looking for hides to skin nor goats to scape . '' </s>
<s> Major Battle himself speaks in pure Pentagonese : `` Without further monetary-stroke-military aid , scores of Ambiguan freedom lovers , who had gone way out on their life and limbs for us , were literally cut off at the knees without a paddle . '' </s>
<s> At another point he intones : `` Publicity is a small price to pay for secrecy . '' </s>
<s> The evening is short -- 95 minutes without an intermission -- but even so , as the play progresses the thrust of Mr. Gelbart 's satire loses its sharpness as his targets pop up ever more predictably . </s>
<s> Most of the evening , though , is filled with rare and welcome wit . </s>
<s> In `` Mastergate , '' Mr. Gelbart has provided us not just one but two commodities that have all but disappeared from the Broadway theater : sharp political satire and an even sharper appreciation of the value of language . </s>
