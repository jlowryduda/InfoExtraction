<s> -LRB- During its centennial year , The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history . -RRB- </s>
<s> THE YOM KIPPUR WAR , WHEN EGYPT CRASHED into Israel on Oct. 6 , 1973 , the holiest day in the Jewish calendar , lasted barely a month . </s>
<s> But one far-afield effect is still with us . </s>
<s> The Arab states , always bitterly resentful of U.S. support toward Israel , realized they held an irresistable weapon -- oil . </s>
<s> Early in October , six Arab nations in the Persian Gulf jacked up prices sharply . </s>
<s> On Oct. 22 , led by Saudi Arabia , the world 's largest exporter , they embargoed oil shipments to the U.S. and to the Netherlands , Israel 's staunchest European ally . </s>
<s> The timing was perfect . </s>
<s> The Arabs had tried embargos before . </s>
<s> In 1956 , when Britain , France and Israel invaded Egypt to seize the Suez Canal , Arab producers cut off supplies to Europe . </s>
<s> Texas simply pumped harder . </s>
<s> U.S. oil supplies , however , had peaked in 1970 and 1971 and by 1973 were declining . </s>
<s> Imports , then six million barrels a day , came primarily from Venezuela and Canada . </s>
<s> But Middle East supplies were growing in importance . </s>
<s> By 1973 , the U.S. was bringing in two million barrels of Arab oil a day , more than 10 % of the 17.3 million barrels consumed daily . </s>
<s> Politics and economics conspired . </s>
<s> Japan and Europe , far more dependent on Mideast oil than the U.S. , would n't offend the Arabs or trade off their precious supplies . </s>
<s> The U.S. did manage to supply the Dutch with oil by relabeling supplies ; once oil is shipped , no one can tell its source . </s>
<s> But car-happy Americans panicked , and so did the U.S. and other oil-consuming governments . </s>
<s> `` Shortage '' and `` crisis '' became buzz words , although neither really applied . </s>
<s> The spot dislocations that showed up were largely the result of confusion -LRB- much of it in Washington -RRB- , though that was cold comfort for drivers waiting in mile-long lines at the gas pumps . </s>
<s> The embargo lasted only six months , but the price hikes became a fact of life . </s>
<s> What the Arabs started , inflation finished . </s>
<s> Once and for all , $ 5-a-barrel crude oil and 35-cents-a-gallon gasoline were history . </s>
