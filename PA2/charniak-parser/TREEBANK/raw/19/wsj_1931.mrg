<s> News of the major earthquake in California Tuesday triggered a round of dollar sales in early Asian trade , but most foreign-exchange dealers said they expect the impact of the quake on financial markets to be short-lived . </s>
<s> Despite the dollar 's lackluster performance , some foreign-exchange traders maintain that the U.S. unit remains relatively well bid . </s>
<s> Harris Trust 's Mr. Woodland noted that the unit continues to show resilience in the face of a barrage of `` headline negatives '' in recent weeks , including rate increases in Europe and Japan , aggressive central bank intervention , a 190-point plunge in New York stock prices , an unexpectedly poor U.S. trade report and action by the Federal Reserve to nudge U.S. rates lower . </s>
<s> While Mr. Woodland does n't predict a significant climb for the U.S. unit in light of recent moves in interest rates around the world , he noted that `` its downside potential is surprisingly and -- for dollar bulls -- `` impressively '' limited . </s>

<s> Some analysts note that after last week 's stock market tailspin and Tuesday 's California earthquake , it 's hard to gauge where the central bank wants the key federal funds rate . </s>
<s> They say that the earthquake , by preventing many banks from operating at full capacity , has given the Fed an additional reason to keep liquidity at a high level . </s>
<s> The Fed did , in fact , execute $ 1.5 billion of liquidity-enhancing customer repurchase agreements , the third set of repurchase orders in three days . </s>
<s> Analysts said the additional liquidity should tend to reduce the federal funds rate . </s>
<s> For now , traders say the foreign exchange market is scrutinizing both federal funds and events on Wall Street . </s>
<s> They note that the dollar remains extremely vulnerable to the slightest bad news from the stock exchange . </s>
<s> Indeed , the U.S. unit edged lower as the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped about 13 points in early trading . </s>
