<s> Junk-bond markdowns , an ongoing Securities and Exchange Commission investigation , a Drexel Burnham Lambert connection , a fizzled buy-out rumor . </s>
<s> All this has cast a pall over Columbia Savings & Loan Association and its high-rolling 43-year-old chairman , Thomas Spiegel , who built the $ 12.7 billion Beverly Hills , Calif. , thrift with high-yield junk bonds . </s>
<s> Bears have targeted Columbia 's stock because of the thrift 's exposure to the shaky junk market . </s>
<s> And some investors fault Mr. Spiegel 's life style ; he earns millions of dollars a year and flies around in Columbia 's jet planes . </s>
<s> Columbia stock recently hit 4 1\/8 , after reaching 11 3\/4 earlier this year on rumors that Mr. Spiegel would take the thrift private . </s>
<s> Moreover , junk professionals think Columbia 's huge third-quarter markdown of its junk portfolio to $ 4.4 billion was n't enough , meaning another markdown could be coming . </s>
<s> But in recent days , Columbia has edged up , closing at 5 1\/4 , up 3\/8 , yesterday on revived speculation that the thrift might restructure . </s>
<s> Mr. Spiegel 's fans say Columbia 's Southern California branches are highly salable , and the thrift has $ 458 million of shareholders equity underlying its assets . </s>
<s> That 's almost $ 10 of equity for each Columbia share , including convertible preferred shares , though more junk markdowns would reduce the cushion . </s>
<s> Columbia has only about 10 million common shares in public hands . </s>
<s> The Spiegel family has 25 % of the common and 75 % of the votes . </s>
<s> Other big common holders are Carl Lindner 's American Financial , investor Irwin Jacobs and Pacific Financial Research , though the latter cut its stake this summer . </s>
<s> While many problems would attend a restructuring of Columbia , investors say Mr. Spiegel is mulling such a plan to mitigate Columbia 's junk problems . </s>
<s> Indeed , Columbia executives recently told reporters they were interested in creating a separate unit to hold Columbia 's junk bonds and perhaps do merchant banking . </s>
<s> Columbia wo n't comment on all the speculation . </s>
<s> But like other thrifts , it 's expected to seek regulators ' consent to create a distinct junk-bond entity . </s>
<s> Plans to do this are due to be filed in a week or so . </s>
<s> New rules force thrifts to write down their junk to market value , then sell the bonds over five years . </s>
<s> That 's why Columbia just wrote off $ 130 million of its junk and reserved $ 227 million for future junk losses . </s>
<s> But if Columbia could keep its junk bonds separate from the thrift till they mature -- at full value , unless the issuer goes bust or restructures -- the junk portfolio might do all right . </s>
<s> Columbia , a longtime Drexel client , wo n't provide current data on its junk . </s>
<s> But its 17 big junk holdings at year end showed only a few bonds that have been really battered . </s>
<s> These were Allied Stores , Western Union Telegraph , Gillett Holdings , SCI Television and Texas Air , though many other bonds in Columbia 's portfolio also have lost value . </s>
<s> Possibly offsetting that , Columbia recently estimated it has unrealized gains on publicly traded equity investments of more than $ 70 million . </s>
<s> It also hopes for ultimate gains of as much as $ 300 million on equity investments in buy-outs and restructurings . </s>
<s> One trial balloon Mr. Spiegel is said to have floated to investors : Columbia might be broken up , as Mellon Bank was split into a good bank and a bad bank . </s>
<s> But Columbia 's good bank would be a regulated thrift , while the bad bank would be a private investment company , holding some of Columbia 's junk bonds , real estate and equity investments . </s>
<s> Some think Columbia 's thrift , which now is seeking a new chief operating officer , might be capitalized at , say $ 300 million , and shopped to a commercial bank that wants a California presence . </s>
<s> The thrift surely could be sold for more than the value of its equity , financial industry executives say . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , the bad bank with the junk bonds -- and some capital -- might be spun off to Columbia shareholders , including Mr. Spiegel , who might then have a new career , investors say . </s>
<s> It is n't clear how much a restructuring would help Columbia stockholders . </s>
<s> But `` the concept is workable . </s>
<s> You sell the good bank as an ongoing operation and use some of the proceeds to capitalize the bad bank , '' says thrift specialist Lewis Ranieri of Ranieri Associates in New York . </s>
<s> Mr. Spiegel 's next career move is a subject of speculation on Wall Street . </s>
<s> Few people think Mr. Spiegel wants to run a bread-and-butter thrift , which current rules would force Columbia to become . </s>
<s> `` They are n't really a thrift , '' says Jonathan Gray , a Sanford C. Bernstein analyst . </s>
<s> Of course , regulators would have to approve Columbia 's reorganization . </s>
<s> And some investment bankers say a restructuring is n't feasible while the SEC still is scrutinizing Mr. Spiegel 's past junk-bond trades . </s>
