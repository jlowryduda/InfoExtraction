<s> Despite one of the most devastating droughts on record , net cash income in the Farm Belt rose to a new high of $ 59.9 billion last year . </s>
<s> The previous record was $ 57.7 billion in 1987 , according to the Agriculture Department . </s>
<s> Net cash income -- the amount left in farmers ' pockets after deducting expenses from gross cash income -- increased in 33 states in 1988 , as the drought cut into crop yields and drove up commodity prices , the department 's Economic Research Service reported yesterday . </s>
<s> Most of those states set farm income records . </s>
<s> The worst crop damage occurred in the Midwestern Corn Belt and the northern Great Plains . </s>
<s> What saved many farmers from a bad year was the opportunity to reclaim large quantities of grain and other crops that they had `` mortgaged '' to the government under price-support loan programs . </s>
<s> With prices soaring , they were able to sell the reclaimed commodities at `` considerable profit , '' the agency 's 240-page report said . </s>
<s> In less parched areas , meanwhile , farmers who had little or no loss of production profited greatly from the higher prices . </s>
<s> To the surprise of some analysts , net cash income rose in some of the hardest-hit states , including Indiana , Illinois , Nebraska and the Dakotas . </s>
<s> Analysts attributed the increases partly to the $ 4 billion disaster-assistance package enacted by Congress . </s>
<s> Last year 's record net cash income confirms the farm sector 's rebound from the agricultural depression of the early 1980s . </s>
<s> It also helps explain the reluctance of the major farm lobbies and many lawmakers to make any significant changes in the 1985 farm program next year . </s>
<s> Commodity prices have been rising in recent years , with the farm price index hitting record peaks earlier this year , as the government curtailed production with land-idling programs to reduce price-depressing surpluses . </s>
<s> At the same time , export demand for U.S. wheat , corn and other commodities strengthened , said Keith Collins , a department analyst . </s>
<s> Farmers also benefited from strong livestock prices , as the nation 's cattle inventory dropped close to a 30-year low . </s>
<s> `` All of these forces came together in 1988 to benefit agriculture , '' Mr. Collins said . </s>
<s> California led the nation with $ 6.5 billion in net cash income last year , followed by Texas , $ 3.9 billion ; Iowa , $ 3.4 billion ; Florida , $ 3.1 billion ; and Minnesota , $ 2.7 billion . </s>
<s> Iowa and Minnesota were among the few major farm states to log a decline in net cash income . </s>
<s> Despite federal disaster relief , the drought of 1988 was a severe financial setback for an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 farmers , according to the department . </s>
<s> Many lost their farms . </s>
<s> Department economists do n't expect 1989 to be as good a year as 1988 was . </s>
<s> Indeed , net cash income is likely to fall this year as farm expenses rise and government payments to farmers decline . </s>
<s> At the same time , an increase of land under cultivation after the drought has boosted production of corn , soybeans and other commodities , causing a fall in prices that has been only partly cushioned by heavy grain buying by the Soviets . </s>
<s> Last year , government payments to farmers slipped to less than $ 14.5 billion from a record $ 16.7 billion in 1987 . </s>
<s> Payments are expected to range between $ 9 billion and $ 12 billion this year . </s>
