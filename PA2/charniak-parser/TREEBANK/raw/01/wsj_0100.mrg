<s> For six years , T. Marshall Hahn Jr. has made corporate acquisitions in the George Bush mode : kind and gentle . </s>
<s> The question now : Can he act more like hard-charging Teddy Roosevelt ? </s>
<s> Mr. Hahn , the 62-year-old chairman and chief executive officer of Georgia-Pacific Corp. is leading the forest-product concern 's unsolicited $ 3.19 billion bid for Great Northern Nekoosa Corp . </s>
<s> Nekoosa has given the offer a public cold shoulder , a reaction Mr. Hahn has n't faced in his 18 earlier acquisitions , all of which were negotiated behind the scenes . </s>
<s> So far , Mr. Hahn is trying to entice Nekoosa into negotiating a friendly surrender while talking tough . </s>
<s> `` We are prepared to pursue aggressively completion of this transaction , '' he says . </s>
<s> But a takeover battle opens up the possibility of a bidding war , with all that implies . </s>
<s> If a competitor enters the game , for example , Mr. Hahn could face the dilemma of paying a premium for Nekoosa or seeing the company fall into the arms of a rival . </s>
<s> Given that choice , associates of Mr. Hahn and industry observers say the former university president -- who has developed a reputation for not overpaying for anything -- would fold . </s>
<s> `` There 's a price above which I 'm positive Marshall has the courage not to pay , '' says A.D. Correll , Georgia-Pacific 's executive vice president for pulp and paper . </s>
<s> Says long-time associate Jerry Griffin , vice president , corporate development , at WTD Industries Inc. : `` He is n't of the old school of winning at any cost . '' </s>
<s> He also is a consensus manager , insiders say . </s>
<s> The decision to make the bid for Nekoosa , for example , was made only after all six members of Georgia-Pacific 's management committee signed onto the deal -- even though Mr. Hahn knew he wanted to go after the company early on , says Mr. Correll . </s>
<s> Associates say Mr. Hahn picked up that careful approach to management as president of Virginia Polytechnic Institute . </s>
<s> Assuming that post at the age of 35 , he managed by consensus , as is the rule in universities , says Warren H. Strother , a university official who is researching a book on Mr. Hahn . </s>
<s> But he also showed a willingness to take a strong stand . </s>
<s> In 1970 , Mr. Hahn called in state police to arrest student protesters who were occupying a university building . </s>
<s> That impressed Robert B. Pamplin , Georgia-Pacific 's chief executive at the time , whom Mr. Hahn had met while fundraising for the institute . </s>
<s> In 1975 , Mr. Pamplin enticed Mr. Hahn into joining the company as executive vice president in charge of chemicals ; the move befuddled many in Georgia-Pacific who did n't believe a university administrator could make the transition to the corporate world . </s>
<s> But Mr. Hahn rose swiftly through the ranks , demonstrating a raw intelligence that he says he knew he possessed early on . </s>
<s> The son of a physicist , Mr. Hahn skipped first grade because his reading ability was so far above his classmates . </s>
<s> Moving rapidly through school , he graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Kentucky at age 18 , after spending only 2 1\/2 years in college . </s>
<s> He earned his doctorate in nuclear physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . </s>
<s> Mr. Hahn agrees that he has a `` retentive '' memory , but friends say that 's an understatement . </s>
<s> They call it `` photographic '' . </s>
<s> Mr. Hahn also has engineered a surprising turnaround of Georgia-Pacific . </s>
<s> Taking over as chief executive officer in 1983 , he inherited a company that was mired in debt and hurt by a recession-inspired slide in its building-products business . </s>
<s> Mr. Hahn began selling non-core businesses , such as oil and gas and chemicals . </s>
<s> He even sold one unit that made vinyl checkbook covers . </s>
<s> At the same time , he began building up the pulp and paper segment of the company while refocusing building products on home repair and remodeling , rather than materials for new-home construction . </s>
<s> The idea was to buffet building products from cycles in new-home construction . </s>
<s> The formula has paid off , so far . </s>
<s> Georgia-Pacific 's sales climbed to $ 9.5 billion last year , compared with $ 6 billion in 1983 , when Mr. Hahn took the reins . </s>
<s> Profit from continuing operations has soared to $ 467 million from $ 75 million . </s>
<s> Mr. Hahn attributes the gains to the philosophy of concentrating on what a company knows best . </s>
<s> `` The record of companies that have diversified is n't all that impressive , '' he says . </s>
<s> Nekoosa would n't be a diversification . </s>
<s> It would be a good match , Mr. Hahn and many analysts say , of two healthy companies with high-quality assets and strong cash flows . </s>
<s> The resulting company would be the largest forest-products concern in the world with combined sales of more than $ 13 billion . </s>
<s> But can Mr. Hahn carry it off ? </s>
<s> In this instance , industry observers say , he is entering uncharted waters . </s>
<s> Says Kathryn McAuley , an analyst at First Manhattan Co. : `` This is the greatest acquisition challenge he has faced . </s>
