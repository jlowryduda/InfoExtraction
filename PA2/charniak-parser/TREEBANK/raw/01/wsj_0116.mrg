<s> If you 'd really rather have a Buick , do n't leave home without the American Express card . </s>
<s> Or so the slogan might go . </s>
<s> American Express Co. and General Motors Corp. 's beleaguered Buick division are joining forces in a promotion aimed at boosting Buick 's sales while encouraging broader use of the American Express card . </s>
<s> The companies are giving four-day vacations for two to Buick buyers who charge all or part of their down payments on the American Express green card . </s>
<s> They have begun sending letters explaining the program , which began Oct. 18 and will end Dec. 18 , to about five million card holders . </s>
<s> Neither company would disclose the program 's cost . </s>
<s> Buick approached American Express about a joint promotion because its card holders generally have a `` good credit history '' and are `` good at making payments , '' says a spokeswoman for the division . </s>
<s> American Express also represents the upscale image `` we 're trying to project , '' she adds . </s>
<s> Buick has been seeking for the past few years to restore its reputation as `` the doctor 's car '' -- a product for upscale professionals . </s>
<s> Sales were roughly flat in the 1989 model year compared with a year earlier , though industry sales fell . </s>
<s> But since the 1990 model year began Oct. 1 , Buick sales have plunged 33 % . </s>
<s> For American Express , the promotion is part of an effort to broaden the use of its card for retail sales , where the company expects to get much of the future growth in its card business . </s>
<s> Traditionally , the card has been used mainly for travel and entertainment expenses . </s>
<s> Phillip Riese , an American Express executive vice president , says the promotion with Buick is his company 's first with an auto maker , but `` hopefully -LCB- will be -RCB- the first of many '' in the company 's effort to promote its green card as `` the total car-care card . '' </s>
<s> To that end , American Express has been signing up gasoline companies , car repair shops , tire companies and car dealers to accept the card . </s>
<s> Many auto dealers now let car buyers charge part or all of their purchase on the American Express card , but few card holders realize this , Mr. Riese says . </s>
<s> Until now , however , buyers who wanted to finance part of a car purchase through General Motors Acceptance Corp. could n't put their down payment on a charge card because of possible conflicts with truth-in-lending and state disclosure laws over finance rates , says a spokesman for the GM finance arm . </s>
<s> But GMAC approved the Buick program , he says , because the American Express green card requires payment in full upon billing , and so does n't carry any finance rates . </s>
<s> Mr. Riese says American Express considers GM and Buick `` very sophisticated direct-mail marketers , '' so `` by joining forces with them we have managed to maximize our direct-mail capability . '' </s>
<s> In addition , Buick is a relatively respected nameplate among American Express card holders , says an American Express spokeswoman . </s>
<s> When the company asked members in a mailing which cars they would like to get information about for possible future purchases , Buick came in fourth among U.S. cars and in the top 10 of all cars , the spokeswoman says . </s>
<s> American Express has more than 24 million card holders in the U.S. , and over half have the green card . </s>
<s> GMAC screened the card-member list for holders more than 30 years old with household incomes over $ 45,000 who had n't `` missed any payments , '' the Buick spokeswoman says . </s>
<s> Some 3.8 million of the five million who will get letters were preapproved for credit with GMAC . </s>
<s> These 3.8 million people also are eligible to get one percentage point off GMAC 's advertised finance rates , which start at 6.9 % for two-year loan contracts . </s>
<s> A spokesman for Visa International 's U.S. subsidiary says his company is using promotions to increase use of its cards , but does n't have plans for a tie-in similar to the American Express-Buick link . </s>
<s> Three divisions at American Express are working with Buick on the promotion : the establishment services division , which is responsible for all merchants and companies that accept the card ; the travel division ; and the merchandise sales division . </s>
<s> The vacation packages include hotel accommodations and , in some cases , tours or tickets to local attractions , but not meals . </s>
<s> Destinations are Chicago ; Honolulu ; Las Vegas , Nev. ; Los Angeles ; Miami Beach , Fla. ; New Orleans ; New York ; Orlando , Fla. ; San Francisco ; and Washington , D.C. </s>
<s> A buyer who chooses to fly to his destination must pay for his own ticket but gets a companion 's ticket free if they fly on United Airlines . </s>
<s> In lieu of the vacation , buyers can choose among several prizes , including a grandfather clock or a stereo videocassette recorder . </s>
<s> Card holders who receive the letter also are eligible for a sweepstakes with Buick cars or a Hawaii vacation as prizes . </s>
<s> If they test-drive a Buick , they get an American Express calculator . </s>
<s> This is n't Buick 's first travel-related promotion . </s>
<s> A few years ago , the company offered two round-trip tickets on Trans World Airlines to buyers of its Riviera luxury car . </s>
<s> The promotion helped Riviera sales exceed the division 's forecast by more than 10 % , Buick said at the time . </s>
