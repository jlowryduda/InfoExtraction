<s> Wall Street 's big securities firms face the prospect of having their credit ratings lowered . </s>
<s> The reason : Risks from the firms ' new `` merchant banking '' activities are rising as revenue from the industry 's traditional business erodes . </s>
<s> The downgrading of debt issued by CS First Boston Inc. , parent of First Boston Corp. , by Moody 's Investors Service Inc. , coupled with a Moody 's announcement that Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. is under review for a possible downgrade , sent shivers through the brokerage community this week . </s>
<s> With the shudders came the realization that some of Wall Street 's biggest players are struggling to maintain the stellar credit standing required to finance their activities profitably . </s>
<s> Securities firms are among the biggest issuers of commercial paper , or short-term corporate IOUs , which they sell to finance their daily operations . </s>
<s> The biggest firms still retain the highest ratings on their commercial paper . </s>
<s> But Moody 's warned that Shearson 's commercial paper rating could be lowered soon , a move that would reduce Shearson 's profit margins on its borrowings and signal trouble ahead for other firms . </s>
<s> Shearson is 62%-owned by American Express Co . </s>
<s> `` Just as the 1980s bull market transformed the U.S. securities business , so too will the more difficult environment of the 1990s , '' says Christopher T. Mahoney , a Moody 's vice president . </s>
<s> `` A sweeping restructuring of the industry is possible . '' </s>
<s> Standard & Poor 's Corp. says First Boston , Shearson and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , in particular , are likely to have difficulty shoring up their credit standing in months ahead . </s>
<s> What worries credit-rating concerns the most is that Wall Street firms are taking long-term risks with their own capital via leveraged buy-out and junk bond financings . </s>
<s> That 's a departure from their traditional practice of transferring almost all financing risks to investors . </s>
<s> Whereas conventional securities financings are structured to be sold quickly , Wall Street 's new penchant for leveraged buy-outs and junk bonds is resulting in long-term lending commitments that stretch out for months or years . </s>
<s> `` The recent disarray in the junk bond market suggests that brokers may become longer-term creditors than they anticipated and may face long delays '' in getting their money back , says Jeffrey Bowman , a vice president at S&P , which raised a warning flag for the industry in April when it downgraded CS First Boston . </s>
<s> `` Wall Street is facing a Catch-22 situation , '' says Mr. Mahoney of Moody 's . </s>
<s> Merchant banking , where firms commit their own money , `` is getting riskier , and there 's less of it to go around . '' </s>
<s> In addition , he says , the buy-out business is under pressure `` because of the junk bond collapse , '' meaning that returns are likely to decline as the volume of junk-bond financings shrinks . </s>
<s> In a leveraged buy-out , a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing , with the expectation that the debt will be paid with funds generated by the acquired company 's operations or sales of its assets . </s>
<s> In a recent report , Moody 's said it `` expects intense competition to occur through the rest of the century in the securities industry , which , combined with overcapacity , will create poor prospects for profitability . '' </s>
<s> It said that the `` temptation for managements to ease this profit pressure by taking greater risks is an additional rating factor . '' </s>
<s> Both Moody 's and S&P cited First Boston 's reliance in recent years on merchant banking , which has been responsible for a significant portion of the closely held firm 's profit . </s>
<s> The recent cash squeeze at Campeau Corp. , First Boston 's most lucrative client of the decade , is proving costly to First Boston because it arranged more than $ 3 billion of high-yield , high-risk junk financings for Campeau units . </s>
<s> In addition , a big loan that First Boston made to Ohio Mattress Co . was n't repaid on time when its $ 450 million junk financing for a buy-out of the bedding company was withdrawn . </s>
<s> `` These two exposures alone represent a very substantial portion of CS First Boston 's equity , '' Moody 's said . </s>
<s> `` Total merchant banking exposures are in excess of the firm 's equity . '' </s>
<s> CS First Boston , however , benefits from the backing of its largest shareholder , Credit Suisse , Switzerland 's third largest bank . </s>
<s> Shearson also has been an aggressive participant in the leveraged buy-out business . </s>
<s> But its earnings became a major disappointment as its traditional retail , or individual investor , business showed no signs of rebounding from the slump that followed the October 1987 stock market crash . </s>
<s> In addition , Shearson 's listed $ 2 billion of capital is overstated , according to the rating concerns , because it includes $ 1.7 billion of goodwill . </s>
<s> Shearson `` really only has $ 300 million of capital , '' says Mr. Bowman of S&P . </s>
<s> A Shearson spokesman said the firm is n't worried . </s>
<s> `` A year ago , Moody 's also had Shearson under review for possible downgrade , '' he said . </s>
<s> `` After two months of talks , our rating was maintained . '' </s>
<s> Drexel , meanwhile , already competes at a disadvantage to its big Wall Street rivals because it has a slightly lower commercial paper rating . </s>
<s> The collapse of junk bond prices and the cancellation of many junk bond financings apparently have taken their toll on closely held Drexel , the leading underwriter in that market . </s>
<s> The firm also has been hit with big financial settlements with the government stemming from its guilty plea to six felonies related to a big insider-trading scandal . </s>
<s> Drexel this year eliminated its retail or individual customer business , cutting the firm 's workforce almost in half to just over 5,000 . </s>
<s> Recently , Drexel circulated a private financial statement among several securities firms showing that its earnings performance has diminished this year from previous years . </s>
<s> The firm 's capital , moreover , has n't grown at the same rate as in the past , officials at these firms say . </s>
<s> Drexel remains confident of its future creditworthiness . </s>
<s> `` We 're well positioned with $ 1.7 billion of capital , '' a Drexel spokesman said . </s>
<s> `` And as a leading investment and merchant banking firm , the fact that we are no longer subject to the uncertainties and vicissitudes of the retail business is a major plus in our view . </s>
<s> Moreover , we 've probably been the most aggressive firm on the Street in reducing costs , which are down around 40 % over the last six months . </s>
