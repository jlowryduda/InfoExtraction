<s> Two leading constitutional-law experts said President Bush does n't have the legal authority to exercise a line-item veto . </s>
<s> Professors Philip Kurland of the University of Chicago and Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School said any effort by President Bush to claim authority for a line-item veto would contradict the text of the Constitution and the intent of its authors , as well as the views of previous presidents . </s>
<s> A line-item veto is a procedure that would allow a president to veto part of a big congressional spending bill without having to scuttle the entire measure . </s>
<s> Mr. Bush has said he would like to be able to use this procedure . </s>
<s> A White House spokesman said last week that the president is considering declaring that the Constitution implicitly gives him the authority for a line-item veto to provoke a test case . </s>
<s> But the two legal experts , responding to an inquiry by Sen. Edward Kennedy -LRB- D. , Mass. -RRB- , wrote in a joint letter that the president `` lacks the constitutional authority to exercise a line-item veto . '' </s>
<s> The two professors represent different ends of the political spectrum -- Mr. Kurland is a conservative and Mr. Tribe is a liberal . </s>
<s> The two professors said the Constitution authorizes the president to veto entire bills , not partial measures . </s>
<s> Moreover , they said the first appropriations bill passed 200 years ago covered many different items , and there was no discussion of a line-item veto . </s>
<s> They also said that more than a dozen presidents have called for line-item veto authority since the Civil War , and `` all have shared the view that such lawmaking power is beyond the reach '' of the president . </s>
<s> Sen. Kennedy said in a separate statement that he supports legislation to give the president line-item veto power , but that it would be a `` reckless course of action '' for President Bush to claim the authority without congressional approval . </s>
