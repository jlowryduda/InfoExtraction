<s> Iverson Technology Corp. was one of the fastest-growing small companies in America -- until last year . </s>
<s> The McLean , Va. , company modifies computers to keep sensitive military data out of unfriendly hands . </s>
<s> From 1984 to 1987 , its earnings soared six-fold , to $ 3.8 million , on a seven-fold increase in revenue , to $ 44.1 million . </s>
<s> But in 1988 , it ran into a buzz saw : a Defense Department spending freeze . </s>
<s> Iverson 's earnings plunged 70 % to $ 1.2 million . </s>
<s> The troubles continued in this year 's first half , when profit plunged 81 % to $ 302,000 . </s>
<s> Iverson Technology is one of many small defense contractors besieged by the slowdown in defense spending . </s>
<s> Unlike larger contractors with a broad enough base to weather the downturn easily , these companies are suffering big drops in business as once-lucrative specialty niches in the massive military market erode or even disappear . </s>
<s> Companies that only recently were thriving find themselves scrambling to survive . </s>
<s> As their varied strategies suggest , there is more than one way to respond to a disaster -- though it 's too soon to tell whether the changes will pay off . </s>
<s> For many companies , the instinctive first response is to cut costs . </s>
<s> Others are trying to find specialty defense work spared by the slowdown or new niches created by budget-cutting . </s>
<s> More venturesome businesses are applying their skills in commercial fields . </s>
<s> ERC International Inc. , which provides professional and technical services to the military , is refining its defense niche , not retreating from it . </s>
<s> After quadrupling annual earnings over four years to $ 6.8 million in 1988 , the Fairfax , Va. , company , posted a 23 % drop in earnings for this year 's first half . </s>
<s> In the belief that development of advanced military technology will remain a top Defense Department priority , ERC last year acquired W.J. Schafer Associates , a technical and scientific analysis company with contracts under the Strategic Defense Initiative . </s>
<s> While the SDI anti-missile program recently awarded W.J. Schafer two contracts totaling $ 13.4 million , ERC 's chairman and founder , Jack Aalseth , says he bought the company `` more for its technology than its customer . '' </s>
<s> UNC Inc. , an Annapolis , Md. , contractor that earned $ 23.8 million on revenue of $ 400.4 million in 1988 , has gone even further in realigning its military business . </s>
<s> As orders for its aircraft and submarine parts dwindled , three years of steady growth ended with a 69 % drop in income in this year 's first half . </s>
<s> The company hit on a new strategy : If the Defense Department is so intent on saving money , why not make money off that trend ? </s>
<s> Among the company 's current efforts : repairing old parts at 25 % of the cost of replacing them . </s>
<s> UNC also is selling new parts , if needed , directly to the military instead of through a prime contractor . </s>
<s> At as little as one-third of the government 's cost , the company is running a program to train Army helicopter pilots . </s>
<s> It is also taking over the maintenance of certain Navy aircraft with 40 % fewer people than the military used . </s>
<s> In another approach , tiny Iverson Technology is trying to resume its growth by braving the new world of commercial products . </s>
<s> Donald Iverson , chairman , says he hopes the company can eventually get up to half of its revenue from commercial markets . </s>
<s> For now , he says , `` we 're looking at buying some small companies with niche markets in the personal-computer business . '' </s>
<s> Earlier this month , Mr. Iverson agreed to buy exclusive rights to a software system developed by Visher Systems Inc. , Salt Lake City . </s>
<s> The product automates an array of functions performed at small to medium-size printing companies . </s>
<s> Mr. Iverson says there are 5,000 potential customers for the software in the Washington , D.C. , area alone . </s>
<s> QuesTech Inc. , Falls Church , Va. , also has acquired some companies outside the military market . </s>
<s> Moreover , it 's trying to transfer its skill at designing military equipment to commercial ventures . </s>
<s> A partnership with a Williamsburg , Va. , unit of Shell Oil Co. recently patented a process for producing plastic food containers that wo n't melt in microwave ovens . </s>
<s> `` We 're trying to take the imagination and talent of our engineers and come up with new processes for industry , '' says Vincent Salvatori , QuesTech 's chief executive . </s>
<s> `` It is an effort to branch out from the government , which is very difficult for a defense contractor . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Salvatori should know . </s>
<s> Instead of helping his company in the defense spending slowdown , Dynamic Engineering Inc. , a troubled subsidiary that makes wind tunnels for the space industry , contributed to much of QuesTech 's $ 3.3 million loss on $ 55.6 million in revenue last year . </s>
<s> In January , Mr. Salvatori sold the unit . </s>
<s> `` It was our first acquisition , '' he says , `` and it was a mistake . '' </s>
<s> Some companies are cutting costs and hoping for the best . </s>
<s> Telos Corp. , a Santa Monica , Calif. , provider of software-development and hardware-maintenance services to the military , enjoyed steady growth until this year . </s>
<s> Following a tripling of earnings , to $ 3.9 million , on a doubling of revenue , to $ 116 million , over four years , earnings in the company 's fiscal first quarter , which ended June 30 , plunged 90 % to $ 45,000 . </s>
<s> A one-time write-off for booking nonexistent revenue was partly to blame , but so were lower profits from a stingier contract with the Army and delays in getting paid . </s>
<s> Telos responded by combining three of its five divisions to reduce expenses and `` bring more focus to potentially fewer bidding opportunities , '' says Lin Conger , Telos chairman and controlling shareholder . </s>
<s> `` It 's evident we 're entering a more competitive era , '' he says . </s>
<s> TransTechnology Corp. , a Sherman Oaks , Calif. , defense contractor that earned $ 9.2 million on revenue of $ 235.2 million in 1988 , provides a more dramatic example of cost-cutting . </s>
<s> The company not only merged three military-electronics manufacturing operations , but also closed an unrelated plant that makes ordnance devices used in fighter planes and missiles . </s>
<s> The closing contributed to a $ 3.4 million loss in the fiscal first quarter ended July 31 -- its first quarterly loss since 1974 . </s>
<s> `` Our ordnance business has been hurt very badly by the slowdown , '' says Arch Scurlock , TransTechnology 's chairman . </s>
<s> `` I would n't say we 're out of the business . </s>
<s> But we 're not making as many -LCB- pyrotechnic devices -RCB- as we used to . </s>
