<s> Bethlehem Steel Corp. has agreed in principle to form a joint venture with the world 's second-largest steelmaker , Usinor-Sacilor of France , to modernize a portion of Bethlehem 's ailing BethForge division . </s>
<s> The venture , which involves adding sophisticated equipment to make cast-iron mill rolls , is part of a two-pronged effort to shore up a division that has posted continuing operating losses for several years . </s>
<s> The other element includes consolidating BethForge 's press-forge operations . </s>
<s> The entire division employs about 850 workers . </s>
<s> While the joint venture affects only a small part of Bethlehem 's operations , it is significant because it marks the first time the nation 's No. 2 steelmaker has joined forces with a foreign partner . </s>
<s> Wall Street analysts have criticized Bethlehem for not following its major competitors in linking with a foreign company to share costs and provide technology to modernize old facilities or build new ones . </s>
<s> `` We think it 's a step in the right direction for Bethlehem , '' said Felix Bello , WEFA Group 's international steel analyst . </s>
<s> `` It 's important to share the risk and even more so when the market has already peaked . '' </s>
<s> He said the move could be the beginning of a broader relationship between the two companies , one that could open up new markets for Bethlehem . </s>
<s> Bethlehem had little choice but to go with a European steelmaker , because its competitors already have tapped the Japanese and South Korean industry leaders , analysts noted . </s>
<s> Under terms of the agreement , Usinor 's Chavanne-Ketin unit and Bethlehem would establish a modernized facility to make cast-iron mill rolls at the company 's cast-iron shop here . </s>
<s> Terms for the venture , which would be jointly owned by both companies , were n't disclosed . </s>
<s> The Usinor unit has agreed to provide technology and expertise to install a so-called spin caster by early next fall . </s>
<s> The caster improves the metallurgical quality of the iron mill rolls , which are basically huge rolling pins used to flatten or shape steel products . </s>
<s> Bethlehem is also working with the United Steelworkers union to consolidate BethForge 's two machine shops and four heat-treatment facilities of the press-forge operations . </s>
<s> Once the consolidation is complete , Bethlehem plans to concentrate its forgings business on nuclear fabrication , hardened steel and large-diameter steel rolls for rolling mills and selected custom-die applications . </s>
<s> Bethlehem said earlier this year that it planned to restructure the BethForge division to improve its cost structure . </s>
<s> In the second quarter , Bethlehem posted a $ 50 million charge related to its plans to realign the division . </s>
