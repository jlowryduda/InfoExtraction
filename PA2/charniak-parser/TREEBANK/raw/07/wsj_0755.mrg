<s> Environmental concerns are beginning to have as much influence in oil-industry spending plans as the price of crude does . </s>
<s> In the wake of the Exxon Valdez spill in March , new governmental drilling bans are sharply curtailing exploration in promising locations offshore and in Alaska . </s>
<s> At the same time , moves toward tighter air-quality standards are spurring interest in lighter or alternative fuels that do n't pollute as much as fuel refined from `` heavy '' crudes , generally high in sulfur . </s>
<s> Over the years , the world 's stream of oil has been growing heavier . </s>
<s> So the scramble is on for lighter crudes globally , and for natural gas in the U.S. . </s>
<s> Recently Saudi Arabia and Venezuela , traditional heavy-crude producers , have boasted of new finds of light , low-sulfur oil by their national oil companies . </s>
<s> Venezuela has also earmarked $ 200 million in new money for light-crude exploration . </s>
<s> And some oil companies are trying to lock in future supplies . </s>
<s> Typical is Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi , Italy 's state-owned energy company , which not long ago acquired through its AGIP oil subsidiary a 5 % share in the consortium accounting for half of Nigeria 's oil output . </s>
<s> AGIP already has an oil stake in Libya . </s>
<s> Both countries produce high-quality , low-sulfur crudes especially suited to making high-octane motor fuel at minimum refining cost . </s>
<s> Franco Reviglio , ENI chairman , looks for sweeping structural change in the oil industry -- he calls it a `` revolution '' requiring huge investments -- as a result of environmental issues . </s>
<s> He made a special trip to examine U.S. environmental trends because they are often followed in Europe . </s>
<s> ENI needs to know what 's coming as it prepares to spend some $ 1.3 billion on upgrading its refineries , he says . </s>
<s> Oil companies world-wide will have `` to spend a lot of money for the cleaner fuels that will be required , '' says John H. Lichtblau , the president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation . </s>
<s> It will go for work ranging from refinery modification to changes in the distribution system , including the way service stations pump fuel into cars . </s>
<s> In the U.S. , the search for oil had been headed toward environmentally sensitive areas believed to have vast reserves . </s>
<s> Alaska 's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge alone is thought to hide more than three billion barrels of oil . </s>
<s> Until the tanker spill , Big Oil was slowly convincing authorities it could safely produce from such places . </s>
<s> Now the wildlife refuge has been closed to the industry , possibly for years . </s>
<s> Similarly , a group of companies led by Chevron Corp. has been unable to pump oil found off the California coast in the early 1980s . </s>
<s> A huge production system built in the sea off Santa Barbara and ashore is sitting idle . </s>
<s> But the push for cleaner fuels is increasing the attractiveness of natural gas . </s>
<s> More than half the domestic drilling now under way is for gas , partly on the assumption that demand will rise for a fuel that is cleaner to burn than either oil or coal . </s>
<s> Activity has revived in the largest U.S. gas-producing regions , such as the Gulf of Mexico . </s>
<s> Santa Fe International Corp. , which is owned by Kuwait -LRB- and is n't related to Santa Fe Southern Pacific 's unit -RRB- , is stepping up development of a well off Texas ' Matagorda Island where it found gas in 1987 . </s>
<s> `` We could have sat on it longer , but the impetus is to get the gas to the marketplace , '' says Richard Poole , senior scout for Santa Fe International . </s>
<s> `` We 're trying to get it on line as soon as possible now . '' </s>
<s> This month , Exxon Corp. announced plans for a 400-day project drilling for gas about five miles underground in the Anadarko Basin of western Oklahoma -- the deepest drilling project in the U.S. . </s>
<s> Exxon will use a Parker Drilling Co. rig built in 1981 that can go down 9 1\/2 miles . </s>
