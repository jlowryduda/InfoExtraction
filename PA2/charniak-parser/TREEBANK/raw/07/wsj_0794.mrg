<s> This is slightly adapted from remarks Oct. 7 by former Secretary of State George P. Shultz to an alumni gathering at the Stanford Business School , where he has returned to the faculty : </s>
<s> I was struck a couple of years ago by the drug-interdiction effort in the Bahamas . </s>
<s> We had intercepted during the year an estimated $ 5 billion street value of cocaine . </s>
<s> I do n't know how much got through . </s>
<s> Nobody has any credible estimate . </s>
<s> The GNP of the Bahamas is probably somewhere between one and two billion dollars . </s>
<s> So you get an idea of the leverage there and elsewhere that our market for drugs has brought about . </s>
<s> I welcome the emphasis that is now being put on the drug problem . </s>
<s> The efforts to get to the people who are addicted , try to rehabilitate them ; if they can not be rehabilitated , at least to contain them ; to educate people , to strongly discourage use of drugs by people who are casual users and first users , to stop this process among the young -- all of these things I think are extremely important . </s>
<s> But , I have to tell you that it seems to me that the conceptual base of the current program is flawed and the program is not likely to work . </s>
<s> The conceptual base -- a criminal-justice approach -- is the same that I have worked through before , in the Nixon administration when I was budget director and secretary of the treasury with jurisdiction over the Customs . </s>
<s> We designed a comprehensive program , and we worked hard on it . </s>
<s> In the Reagan administration we designed a comprehensive program ; we worked very hard on it . </s>
<s> Our international efforts were far greater than ever before . </s>
<s> You 're looking at a guy whose motorcade was attacked in Bolivia by the drug terrorists , so I 'm personally a veteran of this war . </s>
<s> What we have before us now is essentially the same program but with more resources plowed into all of the efforts to enforce and control . </s>
<s> These efforts wind up creating a market where the price vastly exceeds the cost . </s>
<s> With these incentives , demand creates its own supply and a criminal network along with it . </s>
<s> It seems to me we 're not really going to get anywhere until we can take the criminality out of the drug business and the incentives for criminality out of it . </s>
<s> Frankly , the only way I can think of to accomplish this is to make it possible for addicts to buy drugs at some regulated place at a price that approximates their cost . </s>
<s> When you do that you wipe out the criminal incentives , including , I might say , the incentive that the drug pushers have to go around and get kids addicted , so that they create a market for themselves . </s>
<s> They wo n't have that incentive because they wo n't have that market . </s>
<s> So I think the conceptual base needs to be thought out in a different way . </s>
<s> If I am catching your attention , then read a bold and informative article in this September 's issue of Science by Ethan Nadelmann on this subject . </s>
<s> We need at least to consider and examine forms of controlled legalization of drugs . </s>
<s> I find it very difficult to say that . </s>
<s> Sometimes at a reception or cocktail party I advance these views and people head for somebody else . </s>
<s> They do n't even want to talk to you . </s>
<s> I know that I 'm shouting into the breeze here as far as what we 're doing now . </s>
<s> But I feel that if somebody does n't get up and start talking about this now , the next time around , when we have the next iteration of these programs , it will still be true that everyone is scared to talk about it . </s>
<s> No politician wants to say what I just said , not for a minute . </s>
