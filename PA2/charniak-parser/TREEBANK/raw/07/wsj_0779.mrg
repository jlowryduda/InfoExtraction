<s> The stock market correction of Oct. 13 , 1989 , was a grim reminder of the Oct. 19 , 1987 market collapse . </s>
<s> Since , like earthquakes , stock market disturbances will always be with us , it is prudent to take all possible precautions against another such market collapse . </s>
<s> In general , markets function well and adjust smoothly to changing economic and financial circumstances . </s>
<s> But there are times when they seize up , and panicky sellers can not find buyers . </s>
<s> That 's just what happened in the October 1987 crash . </s>
<s> As the market tumbled , disorderly market conditions prevailed : The margins between buying bids and selling bids widened ; trading in many stocks was suspended ; orders took unduly long to be executed ; and many specialists stopped trading altogether . </s>
<s> These failures in turn contributed to the fall in the market averages : Uncertainty extracted an extra risk premium and margin-calls triggered additional selling pressures . </s>
<s> The situation was like that of a skier who is thrown slightly off balance by an unexpected bump on the slope . </s>
<s> His skis spread farther and farther apart -- just as buy-sell spreads widen during a financial panic -- and soon he is out of control . </s>
<s> Unable to stop his accelerating descent , he crashes . </s>
<s> After the 1987 crash , and as a result of the recommendations of many studies , `` circuit breakers '' were devised to allow market participants to regroup and restore orderly market conditions . </s>
<s> It 's doubtful , though , whether circuit breakers do any real good . </s>
<s> In the additional time they provide even more order imbalances might pile up , as would-be sellers finally get their broker on the phone . </s>
<s> Instead , an appropriate institution should be charged with the job of preventing chaos in the market : the Federal Reserve . </s>
<s> The availability of timely assistance -- of a backstop -- can help markets retain their resilience . </s>
<s> The Fed already buys and sells foreign exchange to prevent disorderly conditions in foreign-exchange markets . </s>
<s> The Fed has assumed a similar responsibility in the market for government securities . </s>
<s> The stock market is the only major market without a market-maker of unchallenged liquidity or a buyer of last resort . </s>
<s> This does not mean that the Federal Reserve does not already play an important indirect role in the stock market . </s>
<s> In 1987 , it pumped billions into the markets through open market operations and the discount window . </s>
<s> It lent money to banks and encouraged them to make funds available to brokerage houses . </s>
<s> They , in turn , lent money to their customers -- who were supposed to recognize the opportunity to make a profit in the turmoil and buy shares . </s>
<s> The Fed also has the power to set margin requirements . </s>
<s> But would n't it be more efficient and effective to supply such support to the stock market directly ? </s>
<s> Instead of flooding the entire economy with liquidity , and thereby increasing the danger of inflation , the Fed could support the stock market directly by buying market averages in the futures market , thus stabilizing the market as a whole . </s>
<s> The stock market is certainly not too big for the Fed to handle . </s>
<s> The foreign-exchange and government securities markets are vastly larger . </s>
<s> Daily trading volume in the New York foreign exchange market is $ 130 billion . </s>
<s> The daily volume for Treasury Securities is about $ 110 billion . </s>
<s> The combined value of daily equity trading on the New York Exchange , the American Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ over-the-counter market ranges between $ 7 billion and $ 10 billion . </s>
<s> The $ 13 billion the Fed injected into the money markets after the 1987 crash is more than enough to buy all the stocks traded on a typical day . </s>
<s> More carefully targeted intervention might actually reduce the need for government action . </s>
<s> And taking more direct action has the advantage of avoiding sharp increases in the money supply , such as happened in October 1987 . </s>
<s> The Fed 's stock market role ought not to be very ambitious . </s>
<s> It should seek only to maintain the functioning of markets -- not to prop up the Dow Jones or New York Stock Exchange averages at a particular level . </s>
<s> The Fed should guard against systemic risk , but not against the risks inherent in individual stocks . </s>
<s> It would be inappropriate for the government or the central bank to buy or sell IBM or General Motors shares . </s>
<s> Instead , the Fed could buy the broad market composites in the futures market . </s>
<s> The increased demand would normalize trading and stabilize prices . </s>
<s> Stabilizing the derivative markets would tend to stabilize the primary market . </s>
<s> The Fed would eliminate the cause of the potential panic rather than attempting to treat the symptom -- the liquidity of the banks . </s>
<s> Disorderly market conditions could be observed quite frequently in foreign exchange markets in the 1960s and 1970s . </s>
<s> But since the member countries of the International Monetary Fund agreed to the `` Guidelines to Floating '' in 1974 , such difficulties have been avoided . </s>
<s> I can not recall any disorder in currency markets since the 1974 guidelines were adopted . </s>
<s> Thus , the mere existence of a market-stabilizing agency helps to avoid panic in emergencies . </s>
<s> The old saying advises : `` If it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . '' </s>
<s> But this could be a case where we all might go broke if it is n't fixed . </s>
<s> Mr. Heller , now at VISA International , was a governor of the Federal Reserve Board from 1986 until earlier this year . </s>
<s> This is adapted from a speech to the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco . </s>
