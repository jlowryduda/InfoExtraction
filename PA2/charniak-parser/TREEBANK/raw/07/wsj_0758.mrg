<s> Albert Engelken and Robert Thomson had never met , though for 38 years their lives had been intertwined in a way peculiar to the sports world . </s>
<s> Mr. Engelken , now a transit-association executive in Washington , D.C. , and Mr. Thomson , a paper-products salesman in Montvale , N.J. , had n't even talked to each other . </s>
<s> But one recent day , they became much closer . </s>
<s> Mr. Engelken , a rabid baseball fan , pores over the sports pages to chart the exploits of `` my favorite and not-so-favorite teams and players . '' </s>
<s> He often groans , he says , at the `` clutter '' of sports stories about drugs , alcohol , gambling and some player 's lament `` about the miserly millions he is offered to play the game . '' </s>
<s> His morning paper , the Washington Post , even carries a sports column called `` Jurisprudence '' that recounts the latest arrests and convictions of players and team managers . </s>
<s> Like many sports buffs , Mr. Engelken has turned cynic . </s>
<s> But his is a story about a hero in an era of sports anti-heroes , and about what Babe Ruth , Mr. Engelken reminds us , once called `` the only real game in the world . '' </s>
<s> To Mr. Engelken , it is also a story `` about love , because I 'm blessed to have a wife who still thinks her slightly eccentric husband 's 50th birthday deserves the ultimate present . '' </s>
<s> To understand what Mr. Engelken means , one must go back to a sunny October afternoon in 1951 at New York 's Polo Grounds stadium , where , it can be argued , the most dramatic moment in baseball history was played out . </s>
<s> It was the ninth inning of the third game of a three-game playoff between the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants -LRB- the predecessor to the San Francisco Giants scheduled to play in tonight 's world series -RRB- . </s>
<s> Baseball fans throughout New York had sweated out a long summer with their teams , and now it had come to this : a battle between the two for the National League pennant -- down to the last inning of the last game , no less . </s>
<s> Some 34,320 fans jammed the stands , and shouted at the top of their lungs . </s>
<s> Mr. Engelken was doing the same across the Hudson River in New Jersey , where , with his nose pressed against the front window of the Passaic-Clifton National Bank , he watched the duel on a television set the bank set up for the event . </s>
<s> The playoff series had riveted the 12-year-old Giants fan . </s>
<s> `` The Giants struck first , winning the opener , 3-1 , on a two-run homer off Dodger right-hander Ralph Branca , '' Mr. Engelken recalls with precision today . </s>
<s> `` The Giants got swamped in the second game , 100 , and trailed 4-1 going into the bottom of the ninth of the third and deciding game . </s>
<s> The Giants scored once and had runners on second -LCB- Whitey Lockman -RCB- and third -LCB- Clint Hartung -RCB- as Bobby Thomson advanced to the plate . '' </s>
<s> The rest , as they say , is history . </s>
<s> Mr. Thomson , a tall , Scottish-born , right-hand hitter , stepped into the batter 's box . </s>
<s> `` Thomson took a called strike , '' Mr. Engelken recounts . </s>
<s> The tension mounted as Ralph Branca , again on the mound , stared down the batter . </s>
<s> He wound up and let loose a fastball . </s>
<s> The pitch sailed toward Bobby Thomson high and inside and then , with a crack of the bat , was sent rocketing back into the lower leftfield stands . </s>
<s> `` Giants fans went into euphoria , '' says Mr. Engelken . </s>
<s> And Bobby Thomson was made a legend . </s>
<s> The same Bobby Thomson , it turns out , who sells those paper-goods today . </s>
<s> There ca n't be an older baseball fan alive who does n't clearly remember that Bobby Thomson homer , who ca n't tell you where he was when he heard the famous Russ Hodges radio broadcast -- the one that concluded with Mr. Hodges shouting , over and over , `` The Giants win the pennant , the Giants win the pennant ! '' </s>
<s> Mr. Engelken and Mr. Thomson drifted in different directions in the subsequent years , and the Polo Grounds , located under Coogan 's Bluff in upper Manhattan , was replaced by a public-housing project . </s>
<s> Mr. Thomson played outfield and third base until 1960 , posting a lifetime .270 batting average and chalking up 264 home runs before retiring and going into paper-goods sales . </s>
<s> Mr. Engelken moved south to Washington , but he took with him enduring memories of the homer of 1951 . </s>
<s> When his wife , Betsy , came down the aisle on their wedding day in 1966 , Mr. Engelken -- no slouch on the romantic front -- gave her the ultimate compliment : `` You look prettier than Bobby Thomson 's home run . '' </s>
<s> The couple 's first dog , Homer , was named after the Great Event , though unwitting friends assumed he was the namesake of the poet . </s>
<s> And when Mr. Engelken 's sister , Martha , who was born two days before the home run , reached her 25th birthday , Mr. Engelken wrote his sports hero to tell him of the coincidence of events . </s>
<s> Mr. Thomson sent off a card to Martha : `` It does n't seem like 25 years since I hit that home run to celebrate your birth , '' it read . </s>
<s> Martha was pleased , but nowhere near as much as Mr. Engelken . </s>
<s> The family license plate reads `` ENG 23 , '' the first three letters of the family name and -- no surprise here -- Bobby Thomson 's uniform number . </s>
<s> And on Mr. Engelken 's 40th birthday , his wife bought a book detailing the big homer and sent it off to Mr. Thomson to be autographed . </s>
<s> `` What could have been better ? '' asks Mr. Engelken . </s>
<s> Betsy Engelken asked the same question earlier this year , when her husband was about to turn 50 . </s>
<s> She had an idea . </s>
<s> On her husband 's 50th birthday -LRB- after an auspicious 23 years of marriage , it should be noted -RRB- , Betsy , Al and their college-bound son set out for New York to visit Fordham University . </s>
<s> Mrs. Engelken had scheduled a stop on the New Jersey Turnpike to , she told her husband , pick up some papers for a neighbor . </s>
<s> The papers would be handed over at a bank of telephone booths just off Exit 10 . </s>
<s> `` It sounded like something out of Ian Fleming , '' Mr. Engelken recalls . </s>
<s> At the appointed exit , the family pulled over , and Mrs. Engelken went to get her papers . </s>
<s> Mr. Engelken turned off the motor and rolled down the window . </s>
<s> In a matter of minutes , she was back , with a tall , silver-haired man in tow . </s>
<s> She crouched down by the car window and addressed her husband with her favorite nickname : </s>
<s> `` Bertie , '' she said , `` Happy 50th Birthday . </s>
<s> This is Bobby Thomson . '' </s>
<s> `` And there he was , '' recalls Mr. Engelken . </s>
<s> `` The hero of my youth , the one person in history I 'd most like to meet . </s>
<s> Keep your Thomas Jeffersons , or St. Augustines or Michelangelos ; I 'd take baseball 's Flying Scot without hesitation . '' </s>
<s> They talked of the home run . </s>
<s> `` I thought it was in the upper deck , '' said Bobby Thomson , now 66 years old . </s>
<s> They talked of the aftermath . </s>
<s> `` I never thought it would become so momentous , '' Bobby remarked . </s>
<s> Mr. Engelken , says his wife , `` was overwhelmed by the whole thing . </s>
<s> It was worth it , just for the look on Albert 's face . '' </s>
<s> The two men spent an hour at Exit 10 , rehashing the event , `` fulfilling the lifelong dream of a young boy now turned 50 , '' Mr. Engelken says . </s>
<s> His hero signed photographs of the homer and diplomatically called Ralph Branca `` a very fine pitcher . '' </s>
<s> And when Mr. Engelken asked him why he took time off from work for somebody he did n't even know , Bobby Thomson replied : `` You know , Albert , if you have the chance in life to make somebody this happy , you have an obligation to do it . '' </s>
<s> In an interview , Mr. Thomson , who is married and has three grown children , says he has few ties to baseball these days , other than playing old-timers games now and again . </s>
<s> But his fans , to his constant amazement , never let him forget the famous four-bagger . </s>
<s> His mail regularly recalls `` my one event , '' and has been growing in recent years . </s>
<s> In response to the letters , Mr. Thomson usually sends an autographed photo with a polite note , and rarely arranges a rendezvous . </s>
<s> But when Betsy Engelken wrote him , saying she could stop near his New Jersey home , it seemed different . </s>
<s> `` What a good feeling it would be for me to do that , '' he says he thought . </s>
<s> When the Engelken family got back from its trip up north , Mr. Engelken wrote it all down , just to make sure no detail was missed . </s>
<s> `` On the way home , '' his notes recall , `` it took concentrated effort to keep that car pointed south . </s>
<s> My mind was miles north at a place called Coogan 's Bluff , where a real sports hero had captured the imagination of a kid who never fully grew up and is all the richer for it . </s>
<s> `` Take heart , sports fans , '' he wrote . </s>
<s> `` Real heroes exist . </s>
<s> You might not find one in the ` Jurisprudence ' column . </s>
<s> But who knows ? </s>
<s> You might meet up with him at that bank of telephone booths just off Exit 10 of the New Jersey Turnpike . </s>
