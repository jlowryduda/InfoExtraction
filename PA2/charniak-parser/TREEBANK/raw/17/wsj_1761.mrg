<s> Okay , now you can pick up that phone . </s>
<s> But do n't do anything rash . </s>
<s> After last Friday 's stock-market plunge , investment professionals cautioned people to resist the urge to call their brokers and sell stocks . </s>
<s> Not selling into a panic turned out to be very good advice : Despite the market 's volatility , the Dow Jones Industrial Average has surged 114 points in the past four days . </s>
<s> Now , with a semblance of normalcy returning , some advisers say it 's time for investors to take a hard , cold look at the stocks they own and consider some careful pruning . </s>
<s> `` The market is sending nervous signals , '' says Peter J. Canelo , chief market strategist for Bear , Stearns & Co. , and it 's `` unwise '' to be overcommitted to stocks . </s>
<s> Alan Weston , president of Weston Capital Management , a Los Angeles money-management firm , adds that in periods of uncertainty like today , `` it 's a good time to cut out the dead branches of your portfolio . '' </s>
<s> Not everybody agrees that it 's time to trim . </s>
<s> `` We are n't inclined to prune stock portfolios now , '' says Steven G. Einhorn , chairman of the investment policy committee of Goldman , Sachs & Co . </s>
<s> `` Investors should stay with their stocks . </s>
<s> We expect a choppy and sloppy market for a short period , but we do n't think it will be ugly . </s>
<s> The downside is limited . '' </s>
<s> And even those who say some selective selling may be in order stress that individuals need to be in the stock market to achieve their long-term investment objectives and to help balance their other assets . </s>
<s> Any selling , they say , should be well thought-out , and executed gradually , during market rallies . </s>
<s> They offer these suggestions : </s>
<s> GET RID OF THE DOGS . </s>
<s> `` Sell stocks that are n't doing well now , and that do n't have good earnings prospects , '' says Alfred Goldman , technical analyst at St. Louis-based A.G. Edwards & Sons . </s>
<s> `` Most people do just the opposite : They sell their winners and keep their losers . '' </s>
<s> Which types of stocks are most likely to qualify ? </s>
<s> Technology stocks , says Mr. Goldman . </s>
<s> WATCH FOR EARNINGS DISAPPOINTMENTS . </s>
<s> A company does n't have to post a loss to be a candidate for sale , says Charles I. Clough Jr. , chief market strategist at Merrill Lynch & Co . </s>
<s> If earnings do n't live up to analysts ' expectations , he says , that 's enough to dump the stock . </s>
<s> John Markese , director of research for the American Association of Individual Investors , raises a cautionary note . </s>
<s> `` Substituting a rule of thumb for your own judgment '' can be a mistake , he says . </s>
<s> An earnings disappointment may reflect a situation that 's short-term . </s>
<s> But Mr. Clough says , `` The risk is that earnings disappointments will continue . '' </s>
<s> The economy is decelerating after six good years , and `` right now it 's better to shoot first and ask questions later . '' </s>
<s> Which types of stocks currently have the greatest earnings risks ? </s>
<s> Computer companies ; commodity cyclical stocks , like autos ; and retailing stocks , he says . </s>
<s> BEWARE OF HEAVY DEBT . </s>
<s> The companies apt to run into earnings problems soonest are the ones with heavy debt loads , says Larry Biehl , partner in the San Mateo , Calif. , money-management firm of Bailard , Biehl & Kaiser . </s>
<s> Mr. Canelo of Bear Stearns agrees : `` If we do have an economic slowdown , '' he says , `` companies with high debt ratios will be dumped en masse . '' </s>
<s> The best course for individual investors is to sell these stocks now , the two advisers say . </s>
<s> SELL ` WHISPER ' STOCKS . </s>
<s> UAL Corp. 's difficulty in obtaining bank financing for its leveraged buy-out and its resulting price plunge is a tip-off to what 's going to happen to `` takeover stocks , '' says Mr. Canelo . </s>
<s> Takeover activity will slow down as more and more banks tighten their lending requirements , he says . </s>
<s> `` There 'll be fewer and fewer deals . '' </s>
<s> Moreover , many financial advisers say individuals should be in the stock market as long-term investors , not as traders trying to catch the next hot stock . </s>
<s> In general , they say , avoid takeover stocks . </s>
<s> COMPARE P\/E RATIOS WITH PROSPECTS . </s>
<s> Mr. Canelo suggests that investors compare price\/earnings ratios -LRB- the price of a share of stock divided by a company 's per-share earnings for a 12-month period -RRB- with projected growth rates . </s>
<s> `` If you think earnings will grow at 20 % a year , it 's all right to pay 20 times earnings , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` But do n't pay 30 times earnings for a company that 's expected to grow at 15 % a year . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Canelo thinks the market will probably go higher , but `` will be ruthless with stocks if the earnings are n't there . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Markese cautions that investors should n't slavishly follow any specific price\/earnings sell trigger . </s>
<s> `` If you say sell anytime a company 's price\/earnings ratio exceeds 15 , that knocks out all your growth stocks , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` You eliminate companies with substantial prospects that are moving up in price . '' </s>
<s> EXAMINE WHAT HAS CHANGED . </s>
<s> Tom Schlesinger , market analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. , says investors should consider selling if there has been a fundamental change in a company since they bought its stock . </s>
<s> Say you purchased a stock because of a new product that was in the works . </s>
<s> Now , because of various difficulties , the product has been scrapped . </s>
<s> Time to sell , says Mr. Schlesinger . </s>
<s> Similarly , he says , suppose you were attracted to a company because of expectations that sales would hit $ 200 million by 1990 . </s>
<s> If things have n't worked out that well , and sales wo n't hit $ 200 million until 1992 , it 's time to consider selling , he says . </s>
