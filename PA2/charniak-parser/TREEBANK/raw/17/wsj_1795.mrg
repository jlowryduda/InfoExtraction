<s> The Federal Reserve System is the standard object of suggestions for organizational and institutional changes , for two reasons . </s>
<s> First , its position in the government is anomalous . </s>
<s> It has an unusual kind of independence from elected officials and still has authority over one of the most powerful of government 's instruments -- the control of the money supply . </s>
<s> Thus we have a condition that is easily described as undemocratic . </s>
<s> Second , the responsibilities of the Federal Reserve as guardian of the currency , which means as guardian of the stability of the price level , sometimes lead it to take measures that are unpopular . </s>
<s> As former Fed Chairman William McChesney Martin used to say , they would have to take the punch bowl away just as the party is getting interesting . </s>
<s> So the Federal Reserve is an attractive target for complaint by politicians . </s>
<s> The Fed is easily assigned the blame for unpleasantness , like high interest rates or slow economic growth , while the politicians can escape responsibility by pointing to the Fed 's independence . </s>
<s> This leads to proposals for `` reform '' of the Fed , which have the common feature of making the Fed more responsive to the administration , to the Congress and to public opinion -- without , however , any assumption of additional responsibility by the politicians . </s>
<s> These proposals include changing the term of the chairman , shortening the terms of the members , eliminating the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks from the decision-making process , putting the Secretary of the Treasury on the Federal Reserve Board , having the Fed audited by an arm of Congress -LRB- the General Accounting Office -RRB- , putting the Fed 's expenditures in the budget , and requiring prompt publication of the Fed 's minutes . </s>
<s> Some of these ideas are again under consideration in Congress . </s>
<s> But these proposals do not rest on a view of what the Fed 's problem is or , if they do , they rest on an incorrect view . </s>
<s> They would not solve the problem ; they would make it worse . </s>
<s> The problem is not that the Fed is too unresponsive to the public interest . </s>
<s> On the contrary , it is too responsive to an incorrect view of the public interest . </s>
<s> The price level in the U.S. is now about 4 1\/4 times as high as it was 30 years ago . </s>
<s> On average , something that cost $ 100 30 years ago now costs $ 425 . </s>
<s> Or , a wage that was $ 100 30 years ago would buy only $ 23.53 worth of stuff today . </s>
<s> On two occasions the inflation rate rose to more than 10 % a year . </s>
<s> In each case the ending of this unsustainable inflation caused a severe recession -- the two worst of the postwar period . </s>
<s> The enormous inflation over the past 30 years was largely due to monetary policy . </s>
<s> At least , it would not have happened without the support of monetary policy that provided for a 10-fold increase in the money supply during the same period . </s>
<s> And that increase in the money supply would not have happened without the consent of the Federal Reserve . </s>
<s> The basic problem of monetary policy , to which reform of the Fed should be addressed , is to prevent a recurrence of this experience . </s>
<s> There were two general reasons for the mistaken monetary policy of the past 30 years : </s>
<s> 1 . To some extent the Federal Reserve shared the popular but incorrect view that expansionary monetary policy could yield a net improvement in employment and output . </s>
<s> 2 . Even where the Fed did not share this view it felt the need to accommodate to it . </s>
<s> Despite all the formal provisions for its independence , the Fed seems constantly to feel that if it uses its independence too freely it will lose it . </s>
<s> The common proposals for reforming the Fed would only make the situation worse , if they had any effect at all . </s>
<s> Putting the Secretary of the Treasury on the Board of Governors , one of the leading proposals today , is an example . </s>
<s> The secretary is the world 's biggest borrower of money . </s>
<s> He has a built-in , constant longing for lower interest rates . </s>
<s> Moreover , he is a political agent of a political president , who naturally gives extraordinary weight to the way the economy will perform before the next election , and less to its longer-run health . </s>
<s> These days , the secretary suffers the further disqualification that he is a member of a club of seven finance ministers who meet occasionally to decide what exchange rates should be , which is a diversion from the real business of the Federal Reserve to stabilize the price level . </s>
<s> How should a reasonable member of the Federal Reserve Board interpret a congressional decision to put the secretary on the board ? </s>
<s> Could he plausibly interpret it as encouragement for the Fed to give primary emphasis to stabilizing the price level ? </s>
<s> Or would he interpret it as instruction to give more weight to these other objectives that the secretary represents -- low interest rates , short-run economic expansion , and stabilization of exchange rates at internationally managed levels ? </s>
<s> The answer seems perfectly clear . </s>
<s> -LRB- True , a succession of Fed chairmen has given color to the notion that the Secretary of the Treasury belongs on the Fed . </s>
<s> By their constant readiness to advise all and sundry about federal budgetary matters the chairmen have encouraged the belief that fiscal policy and monetary policy are ingredients of a common stew , in which case it is natural that the Fed and the Treasury , and probably also the Congress , should be jointly engaged in stirring the pot . </s>
<s> The Fed 's case for its own independence would be a little stronger if it were more solicitous of the independence of the rest of the government . -RRB- </s>
<s> The Fed 's problem is not that it is too independent , or too unpolitical . </s>
<s> The Fed is responsive to , and can not help being responsive to , the more overtly political part of the government . </s>
<s> The Fed exercises a power given to it by Congress and the president . </s>
<s> But Congress and the president accept no responsibility for the exercise of the power they have given the Fed . </s>
<s> Critics of the present arrangement are correct to say that it is undemocratic . </s>
<s> What is undemocratic is the unwillingness of the more political parts of the government to take the responsibility for deciding the basic question of monetary policy , which is what priority should be given to stabilizing the price level . </s>
<s> To leave this decision to an `` independent '' agency is not only undemocratic . </s>
<s> It also prevents the conduct of a policy that has a long-term rationale , because it leaves the Fed guessing about what are the expectations of its masters , the politicians , who have never had to consider the long-term consequences of monetary policy . </s>
<s> The greatest contribution Congress could make at this time would be to declare that stabilizing the price level is the primary responsibility of the Federal Reserve System . </s>
<s> Legislation to this effect has been introduced in Congress in this session by Rep. Stephen Neal -LRB- D. , N.C . -RRB- . </s>
<s> It is not the kind of thing that is likely to be enacted , however . </s>
<s> Congress would be required to make a hard decision , and Congress would much prefer to leave the hard decision to the Fed and retain its rights of complaint after the fact . </s>
<s> People will say that the nation and the government have other objectives , in addition to stabilizing the price level , which is true . </s>
<s> But that is not the same as saying that the Federal Reserve has other objectives . </s>
<s> The government has other agencies and instruments for pursuing these other objectives . </s>
<s> But it has only the Fed to pursue price-level stability . </s>
<s> And the Fed has at most very limited ability to contribute to the achievement of other objectives by means other than by stabilizing the price level . </s>
<s> The two objectives most commonly thought to be legitimate competitors for the attention of the Fed are high employment and rapid real growth . </s>
<s> But the main lesson of economic policy in the past 30 years is that if the Fed compromises with the price-stability objective in the pursuit of these other goals , the result is not high employment and rapid growth but is inflation . </s>
