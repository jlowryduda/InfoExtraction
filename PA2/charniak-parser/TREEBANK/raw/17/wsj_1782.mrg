<s> Housing construction sank in September to its lowest level since the last recession , the Commerce Department reported . </s>
<s> Work began on homes and apartments at an annual rate of 1,263,000 units last month , down 5.2 % from August , the department said . </s>
<s> The September decline followed an even steeper drop of 6.2 % in August and left housing starts at their weakest since October 1982 , when the country was nearing the end of a recession . </s>
<s> Originally the department had reported the August decline as 5 % . </s>
<s> The numbers suggest that the housing industry is still suffering the effects of the Federal Reserve 's battle against inflation . </s>
<s> The industry had shown signs of recovery this summer , after the central bank began to relax its clamp on credit , allowing interest rates to drop a bit after pushing them up for a year . </s>
<s> Sales of new homes rose and inventories of houses , which had been climbing , dropped . </s>
<s> But last month new construction in all types of homes waned , from single-family houses to large apartment complexes . </s>
<s> `` It 's pretty much weak across the board , '' said Martin Regalia , chief economist of the National Council of Savings Institutions . </s>
<s> Mr. Regalia said the industry may be reluctant to step up building at the moment for fear the inventories of unsold homes will increase again . </s>
<s> Another reason for the weakness , he said , may be that mortgage rates have hit a plateau since they began edging down after a peak in March . </s>
<s> In August , rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages started creeping up a bit , but they inched down again through September . </s>
<s> `` Rates have n't really peeled off that much , '' Mr. Regalia said . </s>
<s> `` We 've kind of settled now into an interest-rate environment that 's fairly high . '' </s>
<s> Work was begun on single family homes -- the core of the housing market -- at an annual rate of 971,000 in September , a drop of 2.1 % from the previous month . </s>
<s> That followed a 3.3 % decline in August . </s>
<s> Construction of apartments and other multi-family dwellings slipped 2.2 % to an annual rate of 1,022,000 following a 3.5 % decline in August . </s>
<s> The number of building permits issued for future construction dropped 2.4 % to a 1,296,000 annual rate after rising 3.7 % in August . </s>
<s> All the numbers were adjusted for normal seasonal variations in building activity . </s>
<s> The housing starts numbers , however , are one of the least precise of the government 's economic indicators and are often revised significantly as more information is collected . </s>
