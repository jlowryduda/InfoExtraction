<s> Not exactly sophisticated market research , but who cares as long as the campaigns work . </s>
<s> And ad agencies insist that they do . </s>
<s> Stan Richards of Richards Group Inc. , Dallas , tells of the Texan who saw the agency 's tear-jerking commercial for First Gibraltar Bank F.S.B. -- complete with the state 's anthem -- and promptly invested $ 100,000 in the thrift 's CDs . </s>
