<s> International Business Machines Corp. will announce on Tuesday a slew of software products aimed at eliminating some of the major problems involved in computerizing manufacturing operations , industry executives said . </s>
<s> Many plant floors currently resemble a Tower of Babel , with computers , robots and machine tools that generally speak their own language and have trouble talking to each other . </s>
<s> As a result , if a problem develops on a production line , it is unlikely some supervisor sitting in front of a personal computer or workstation will know about it or be able to correct it . </s>
<s> So IBM will be announcing more than 50 products that will be aimed at letting even the dumbest machine tool talk to the smartest mainframe , or anything in between . </s>
<s> In an unusual display of openness , IBM also will be helping customers tie together operations that include lots of equipment made by IBM 's competitors . </s>
<s> In addition , the executives said IBM will be offering programming tools designed to let anyone working on a factory floor write ad-hoc software , for instance , to do statistical analysis that would pinpoint a problem on a manufacturing line . </s>
<s> In Armonk , N.Y. , an IBM spokeswoman confirmed that IBM executives will be announcing some computer-integrated-manufacturing plans next week but declined to elaborate . </s>
<s> The industry executives said that , as usual with such broad announcements from IBM , this one will be part reality and part strategy . </s>
<s> So it will take many quarters for IBM to roll out all the products that customers need , and it will take years for customers to integrate the products into their operations . </s>
<s> Also as usual , the products will appeal mostly to heavy users of IBM equipment , at least initially . </s>
<s> Still , consultants and industry executives said the products could help make manufacturing operations more efficient , and provide a boost to the computer-integrated-manufacturing market -- a market that Yankee Group , a research firm , has said may double to $ 40 billion by 1993 . </s>
<s> `` This is a step in the right direction , '' said Martin Piszczalski , a Yankee Group analyst . </s>
<s> He added , though , that `` a lot of this is intentions ... . </s>
<s> We 'll have to wait and see '' how the plan develops . </s>
<s> The announcements also should help IBM go on the offensive against Digital Equipment Corp. on the plant floor . </s>
<s> While IBM has traditionally dominated the market for computers on the business side of manufacturing operations and has done well in the market for design tools , Digital has dominated computerized manufacturing . </s>
<s> Hewlett-Packard Co. also has begun to gain share in the whole computer-integrated-manufacturing arena . </s>
<s> IBM will face an uphill climb against Digital , given Digital 's reputation for being better than IBM at hooking together different manufacturers ' computers . </s>
<s> In addition , Hewlett-Packard , while a much smaller player , has made a big commitment to the sorts of industry standards that facilitate those hookups and could give IBM some problems . </s>
<s> Both can be expected to go after the market aggressively : Gartner Group Inc. , a research firm , estimated the Digital gets 30 % of its revenue from the manufacturing market , and Hewlett-Packard gets 50 % . </s>
<s> IBM , which Gartner Group said generates 22 % of its revenue in this market , should be able to take advantage of its loyal following among buyers of equipment . </s>
<s> That is because many companies will standardize on certain types of equipment as the various parts of the manufacturing market merge , and IBM is the biggest player . </s>
<s> But much will depend on how quickly IBM can move . </s>
<s> The whole idea of computer-integrated manufacturing , CIM , seems to be making a comeback after losing a little luster over the past couple of years when it became apparent that it was n't a panacea that would make U.S. plants more efficient and banish foreign competition . </s>
<s> Erik Keller , a Gartner Group analyst , said organizational changes may still be required to really take advantage of CIM 's capabilities -- someone on the shop floor may not like having someone in an office using a personal computer to look over his shoulder , for instance , and may be able to prevent that from happening . </s>
<s> But he said a system such as IBM 's should help significantly . </s>
<s> In making polyethylene sheets out of plastic chips , for instance , a chip sometimes does n't melt , gets caught in the machinery and creates a run in the sheets . </s>
<s> That can be expensive , because the problem may not be noticed for a while , and the sheets are typically thrown away . </s>
<s> But Mr. Keller said that , if computers can be integrated into the process , they could alert an operator as soon as the problem occurred . </s>
<s> They could also check through the orders on file to find a customer that was willing to accept a lower grade of polyethylene . </s>
<s> The computer would let the machine run just until that order was filled , eliminating waste . </s>
<s> This sort of improved link figures to eventually become a significant weapon for some companies . </s>
<s> Companies might be able to tell salespeople daily , for instance , about idle equipment , so they could offer discounts on whatever that equipment produces . </s>
<s> Salespeople also could get a precise reading on when products could be delivered -- in much the same way that Federal Express has marketed its ability to tell exactly where a package is in the delivery system . </s>
