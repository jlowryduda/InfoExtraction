<s> Sebastian Guzman Cabrera took over the oil workers union , Mexico 's most powerful labor organization , only last January . </s>
<s> But even in that short time Mr. Guzman Cabrera has become as controversial in his own way as his deposed predecessor , Joaquin Hernandez Galicia , known as La Quina . </s>
<s> President Carlos Salinas de Gortari used the army to oust La Quina , who reigned for 28 years over a graft-riddled empire that made state-run Petroleos Mexicanos , or Pemex , one of the world 's most inefficient oil companies . </s>
<s> Now , Mr. Guzman Cabrera is facing accusations that he 's as much a company man as La Quina was a crook . </s>
<s> In recent contract negotiations with Pemex management , Mr. Guzman Cabrera accepted major concessions that greatly curtail the union 's role in subcontracting , long a source of millions of dollars in illicit earnings . </s>
<s> And with the quiet pragmatism of Mr. Guzman Cabrera replacing the prickly populism of La Quina , government technocrats have been given a free hand to open the petrochemical sector to wider private and foreign investment . </s>
<s> Mr. Guzman Cabrera 's new order has n't arrived without resistance . </s>
<s> Brawls between union factions still erupt at Pemex installations . </s>
<s> Leftist leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas publicly questioned Mr. Guzman Cabrera 's `` moral quality , '' suggesting he is part of a conspiracy to turn over the country 's oil , a symbol of Mexican nationalism , to foreigners . </s>
<s> The 61-year-old Mr. Guzman Cabrera takes such criticisms in stride . </s>
<s> `` This is n't a new kind of union leadership , it 's a new Mexico . </s>
<s> We 're no longer afraid of associating with private or foreign capital , '' he says . </s>
<s> Pemex , which produces 40 % of government revenue , desperately needs new investment . </s>
<s> Since world oil prices collapsed in 1982 , the government has siphoned Pemex 's coffers to make payments on Mexico 's $ 97 billion foreign debt . </s>
<s> Little money has been returned to upgrade Pemex 's aging facilities . </s>
<s> While the government drains Pemex from above , the union has drained it from below . </s>
<s> A bloated payroll and pervasive graft caused Pemex 's operating costs to balloon to 95 cents of each $ 1 in sales , far above the industry norm . </s>
<s> The declines in investment and efficiency explain in part why Mexico has been importing gasoline this year . </s>
<s> Some projections show Mexico importing crude by the end of the century , barring an overhaul of operations . </s>
<s> `` Whatever you tried to change , whether it was cutting costs or attracting new partners , the big obstacle was the old union leadership , '' says oil consultant George Baker . </s>
<s> Enter Mr. Guzman Cabrera , who has a clear understanding of where union leaders fit in the pro-enterprise regime of President Salinas . </s>
<s> `` I 'm the secretary-general , if there is one , '' he says , greeting a visitor to his office . </s>
<s> Beginning as a laborer in a refinery , Mr. Guzman Cabrera put in more than 40 years at Pemex before being pushed into retirement by La Quina after a dispute two years ago . </s>
<s> Though he also long benefited from the system built by La Quina , Mr. Guzman Cabrera says union perks had simply gotten out of hand . </s>
<s> They are `` at the base of all of the problems of corruption , '' he says . </s>
<s> Thus , in recent contract negotiations , Mr. Guzman Cabrera gave up the union 's right to assign 40 % of all of Pemex 's outside contracts -- an enormous source of kickbacks . </s>
<s> The union also ceded the 2 % commission it had received on all Pemex maintenance contracts . </s>
<s> -LRB- The union will keep a 2 % commission on construction projects . -RRB- </s>
<s> The new contract also eliminates the $ 15 monthly coupon , good only at union-owned grocery stores , that was part of the salary of every worker , from roughneck to chief executive . </s>
<s> About 9,800 technical workers , notably chemists and lawyers , were switched to non-union status . </s>
<s> Also , because of its reduced capital budget , Pemex has phased out about 50,000 transitory construction workers , reducing the work force to about 140,000 , the union leader says . </s>
<s> Mr. Guzman Cabrera says the union 's sacrifices will be offset by a wage and benefit package that amounts to a 22 % increase in compensation . </s>
<s> But Pemex managers are the ones most thrilled by the contract . </s>
<s> `` We are retaking the instruments of administration , '' says Raul Robles , a Pemex subdirector . </s>
<s> Pemex officials would n't say how much money the new contract would save the company , but one previous government estimate pegged savings at around $ 500 million a year . </s>
<s> Pemex 's customers also are pleased with the company 's new spirit . </s>
<s> Grupo Desc , a big conglomerate , has long depended on Pemex petrochemicals to produce plastic packing material . </s>
<s> But when the Pemex plant shut down for an annual overhaul , it would never give notice to its customers . </s>
<s> `` The capriciousness would completely disrupt our operations , '' says Ernesto Vega Velasco , Desc 's finance director . </s>
<s> This year , for the first time , Desc and other customers were consulted well in advance of the Pemex plant 's shutdown to ensure minimal inconvenience . </s>
<s> Taming the union complements previous moves by the government to attract private investment in petrochemicals , which Mexico has been forced to import in large quantities in recent years . </s>
<s> In May , the government unveiled new foreign investment regulations that create special trusts allowing foreigners , long limited to a 40 % stake in secondary petrochemical companies , to own up to 100 % . </s>
<s> Later , the government reclassified several basic petrochemicals as secondary products . </s>
<s> But Pemex 's courtship with private companies , and especially foreign ones , is controversial in a country where oil has been a symbol of national sovereignty since foreign oil holdings were nationalized in 1938 . </s>
<s> `` They are preparing the workers for what 's coming : foreign control , '' wrote Heberto Castillo , a leftist leader . </s>
<s> Mr. Guzman Cabrera and government officials insist that foreigners will be limited to investing in secondary petroleum products . </s>
<s> But the new union leader makes no apologies for Pemex 's more outward-looking attitude . </s>
<s> `` If we do not integrate into this new world of interdependence , sooner or later we 're going to become victims of our own isolation , '' he says . </s>
