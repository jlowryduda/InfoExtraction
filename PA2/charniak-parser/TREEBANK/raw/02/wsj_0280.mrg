<s> ` Frequent Drinker ' Offer Stirs Up Spirited Debate </s>
<s> TO GRAB a bigger piece of the declining scotch market , Seagram Co. has launched a controversial `` frequent drinker '' promotion for its Chivas Regal brand . </s>
<s> Under the program , dubbed Chivas Class , customers who send in two labels from Chivas bottles will receive an upgrade in seating class on some Trans World Airlines flights . </s>
<s> Repeat customers also can purchase luxury items at reduced prices . </s>
<s> But at a time of mounting concern over alcohol abuse , some liquor marketers consider Seagram 's frequent buyer promotion risky . </s>
<s> `` I 'm surprised they 're doing this , '' says Penn Kavanagh , president of Schieffelin & Somerset Co. , which markets Johnnie Walker scotches . </s>
<s> `` I would be very leery of anything that says if you drink more , you get more . '' </s>
<s> Others question the impact on Chivas 's upscale image of a promotion that has customers soaking off labels . </s>
<s> `` It 's really bizarre , '' says Albert Lerman , creative director at the Wells Rich Greene ad agency . </s>
<s> `` Chivas has an image of something you would savor , rather than guzzle . '' </s>
<s> Chivas Class is n't the first such promotion . </s>
<s> Last year , J&B Scotch offered 500 TWA frequent flier miles in exchange for a label . </s>
<s> And Dewar 's gave discounts on Scottish merchandise to people who sent in bottle labels . </s>
<s> But the scope of Seagram 's Chivas promotion sets it apart . </s>
<s> The current campaign is just the first leg of an aggressive three-to-five-year direct marketing plan . </s>
<s> Seagram says the promotion is designed to build brand loyalty rather than promote heavy drinking . </s>
<s> Seagram asks customers to buy only two or three bottles over a 12-month period , says Richard Shaw , vice president of U.S. direct marketing . </s>
<s> `` We 're not asking them to save up 50 proof-of-purchases . </s>
<s> We 're not saying drink more , we 're saying trade up . '' </s>
<s> Goya Concocts a Milk For Hispanic Tastes </s>
<s> MOST FOOD companies these days are trimming the fat and cholesterol content of their products to appeal to health-conscious consumers . </s>
<s> But Goya Foods Inc. believes it can milk some sales by bucking the trend . </s>
<s> The Secaucus , N.J. , company has formed a joint venture with a distributor called La Lecheria to market a higher-fat milk targeted at Hispanic consumers . </s>
<s> To give Leche Fresca the creamier taste Goya says Hispanics prefer , the new brand has a butterfat content of 3.8 % . </s>
<s> That compares with 3.5 % butterfat for whole milk . </s>
<s> A spokesman for Borden Inc. , the nation 's largest milk producer , concedes Goya may be on to something . </s>
<s> Borden sells considerably more whole milk than reduced-fat milks in southern and Hispanic markets , he says . </s>
<s> Borden even tested a milk with 4 % butterfat in the South , but decided the market was too small . </s>
<s> Goya is selling Leche Fresca in nearly 500 grocery stores and bodegas in New York and parts of New Jersey . </s>
<s> And it 's adding 15 to 20 new outlets a day , says Greg Ricca , sales director at La Lecheria . </s>
<s> Because of Leche Fresca 's success , he says , the joint venture is developing other dairy products tailored to Hispanic tastes . </s>
<s> Jewelry Makers Copy Cosmetics Sales Ploys </s>
<s> FOR YEARS , costume jewelry makers fought a losing battle . </s>
<s> Jewelry displays in department stores were often cluttered and uninspired . </s>
<s> And the merchandise was , well , fake . </s>
<s> As a result , marketers of faux gems steadily lost space in department stores to more fashionable rivals -- cosmetics makers . </s>
<s> But lately , retailers say , fake has become more fashionable . </s>
<s> And jewelry makers are beginning to use many of the same marketing tricks honed in the aggressive world of cosmetics . </s>
<s> Last year , the total women 's fashion jewelry business topped $ 4.9 billion , says Karen Alberg , editor of Accessories magazine . </s>
<s> And it 's growing fast , with annual sales gains of more than 10 % . </s>
<s> To increase their share of that business , jewelry makers such as Crystal Brands Inc. 's Trifari and Monet units and Swank Inc. , maker of Anne Klein jewelry , are launching new lines with as much fanfare as the fragrance companies . </s>
<s> They 're hiring models to stroll the aisles sporting their jewels , and they 're even beginning to borrow a perennial favorite of the beauty business -- offering a gift when consumers make a purchase . </s>
<s> `` We 've started trying just about anything to keep sales moving in the stores , '' says Kim Renk , a Swank vice president . </s>
<s> But there are limits . </s>
<s> Ms. Renk says retailers nixed a promotion for pins with animal motifs . </s>
<s> Her idea : bring in live zoo animals . </s>
<s> Trifari , whose national ads earlier this year included paper cutouts of its costume finery , takes a tamer approach . </s>
<s> The company focuses on the how-to aspects , says Andrew E. Philip , president . </s>
<s> Trifari now trains sales help to advise customers on the best earring styles . </s>
<s> But cosmetics firms still have one big marketing edge : They motivate sales people with commissions . </s>
<s> Jewelry makers rarely pay commissions and are n't expected to anytime soon . </s>
<s> Odds and Ends </s>
<s> DESPITE GROWING interest in the environment , U.S. consumers have n't shown much interest in refillable packages for household products . </s>
<s> Procter & Gamble Co. recently introduced refillable versions of four products , including Tide and Mr. Clean , in Canada , but does n't plan to bring them to the U.S. . </s>
<s> Marketers believe most Americans wo n't make the convenience trade-off ... . </s>
<s> Braumeisters Ltd. tests a beer brewed with oat bran , rather than rice or corn . </s>
<s> Called Otto 's Original Oat Bran Beer , the brew costs about $ 12.75 a case . </s>
<s> No cholesterol , of course . </s>
