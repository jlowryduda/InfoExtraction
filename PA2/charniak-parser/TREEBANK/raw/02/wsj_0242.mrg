<s> Some U.S. allies are complaining that President Bush is pushing conventional-arms talks too quickly , creating a risk that negotiators will make errors that could affect the security of Western Europe for years . </s>
<s> Concerns about the pace of the Vienna talks -- which are aimed at the destruction of some 100,000 weapons , as well as major reductions and realignments of troops in central Europe -- also are being registered at the Pentagon . </s>
<s> Mr. Bush has called for an agreement by next September at the latest . </s>
<s> But some American defense officials believe the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should take more time to examine the long-term implications of the options being considered . </s>
<s> For one thing , Pentagon officials , who asked not to be identified , worry that the U.S. will have a much tougher time persuading Europeans to keep some short-range nuclear weapons on their soil once Soviet armored forces are thinned out . </s>
<s> At the same time , they contend that a reduction of NATO forces under a treaty will increase the possibility of a conventional Soviet attack unless the West retains a residual force of nuclear weapons in Europe . </s>
<s> Allies concerned about the deadline include the British , French and smaller NATO allies , some of whom do n't have adequate staffs to provide quick answers to the questions being raised by what generally are considered the most complex arms-control talks ever attempted . </s>
<s> So far , no ally has complained openly , preserving the impression that NATO is in line with the Bush position that a quick agreement bringing Soviet conventional forces down to parity with NATO is the West 's top bargaining priority . </s>
<s> But even though NATO negotiators have only 10 months left under the Bush timetable , they are still wrestling over such seemingly fundamental questions as `` What is a tank ? '' </s>
<s> Five of the six categories of weapons under negotiation have n't even been defined . </s>
<s> Tanks currently are defined as armored vehicles weighing 25 tons or more that carry large guns . </s>
<s> The Soviets complicated the issue by offering to include light tanks , which are as light as 10 tons . </s>
<s> Oleg A. Grinevsky , the chief Soviet negotiator in the conventional-arms talks , argued that this would mean the Soviets would have to destroy some 1,800 tanks , while the U.S. would lose none because it has no light tanks in Europe . </s>
<s> But the issue is stickier than it seems . </s>
<s> France , Britain and Italy all have light tanks they would like to keep out of the talks . </s>
<s> And some U.S. Army analysts worry that the proposed Soviet redefinition is aimed at blocking the U.S. from developing lighter , more transportable , high-technology tanks . </s>
<s> Defining combat aircraft is even tougher . </s>
<s> The Soviets insisted that aircraft be brought into the talks , then argued for exempting some 4,000 Russian planes because they are `` solely defensive . '' </s>
<s> NATO has n't budged from its insistence that any gun-carrying plane has offensive capability . </s>
<s> The dispute over that issue , according to one U.S. official , is a `` potential treaty stopper , '' and only President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev may be able to resolve it . </s>
<s> Accounting problems raise more knotty issues . </s>
<s> Greece and Turkey , for example , are suspected of overstating their arsenals in hopes that they can emerge from the arms-reduction treaty with large remaining forces to deter each other . </s>
<s> Other nations are n't sure how many weapons they have in their own arsenals . </s>
<s> `` It 's just going to be sloppy , both on our side and theirs -LCB- the Warsaw Pact 's -RCB- , '' says one NATO analyst . </s>
<s> So far , neither the Bush administration nor arms-control experts in Congress seem moved by arguments that these problems may take more time to thrash out than President Bush has allowed . </s>
<s> They argue that the bigger danger would be that the West would delay action so long that the Soviets might back away from the current conciliatory attitude . </s>
<s> `` So what if you miss 50 tanks somewhere ? '' asks Rep. Norman Dicks -LRB- D. , Wash. -RRB- , a member of the House group that visited the talks in Vienna . </s>
<s> `` The bottom line is that if we can get that -LCB- Warsaw Pact -RCB- superiority brought down to parity , we ought to keep pressing ahead as quickly as possible . </s>
<s> I worry more about things becoming so unraveled on the other side that they might become unable to negotiate . </s>
