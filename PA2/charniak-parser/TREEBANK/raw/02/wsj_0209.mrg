<s> Researchers at Plant Genetic Systems N.V. in Belgium said they have developed a genetic engineering technique for creating hybrid plants for a number of key crops . </s>
<s> The researchers said they have isolated a plant gene that prevents the production of pollen . </s>
<s> The gene thus can prevent a plant from fertilizing itself . </s>
<s> Such so-called male-sterile plants can then be fertilized by pollen from another strain of the plant , thereby producing hybrid seed . </s>
<s> The new generation of plants will possess the flourishing , high-production trait known as `` hybrid vigor , '' similar to that now seen in hybrid corn . </s>
<s> `` The development could have a dramatic effect on farm production , especially cotton , '' said Murray Robinson , president of Delta & Pine Land Co. , a Southwide Inc. subsidiary that is one of the largest cotton seed producers in the U.S. . </s>
<s> On a commercial scale , the sterilization of the pollen-producing male part has only been achieved in corn and sorghum feed grains . </s>
<s> That 's because the male part , the tassel , and the female , the ear , are some distance apart on the corn plant . </s>
<s> In a labor-intensive process , the seed companies cut off the tassels of each plant , making it male sterile . </s>
<s> They sow a row of male-fertile plants nearby , which then pollinate the male-sterile plants . </s>
<s> The first hybrid corn seeds produced using this mechanical approach were introduced in the 1930s and they yielded as much as 20 % more corn than naturally pollinated plants . </s>
<s> The vast majority of the U.S. corn crop now is grown from hybrid seeds produced by seed companies . </s>
<s> A similar technique is almost impossible to apply to other crops , such as cotton , soybeans and rice . </s>
<s> The male part , the anthers of the plant , and the female , the pistils , of the same plant are within a fraction of an inch or even attached to each other . </s>
<s> The anthers in these plants are difficult to clip off . </s>
<s> In China , a great number of workers are engaged in pulling out the male organs of rice plants using tweezers , and one-third of rice produced in that country is grown from hybrid seeds . </s>
<s> At Plant Genetic Systems , researchers have isolated a pollen-inhibiting gene that can be inserted in a plant to confer male sterility . </s>
<s> Jan Leemans , research director , said this gene was successfully introduced in oil-producing rapeseed plants , a major crop in Europe and Canada , using as a carrier a `` promoter gene '' developed by Robert Goldberg at the University of California in Los Angeles . </s>
<s> The sterilizing gene is expressed just before the pollen is about to develop and it deactivates the anthers of every flower in the plant . </s>
<s> Mr. Leemans said this genetic manipulation does n't hurt the growth of that plant . </s>
<s> The researchers also pulled off a second genetic engineering trick in order to get male-sterile plants in large enough numbers to produce a commercial hybrid seed crop . </s>
<s> They attached a second gene , for herbicide resistance , to the pollen-inhibiting gene . </s>
<s> Both genes are then inserted into a few greenhouse plants , which are then pollinated and allowed to mature and produce seed . </s>
<s> The laws of heredity dictate that half of the plants springing from these greenhouse-produced seeds will be male sterile and herbicide resistant and half will be male fertile and herbicide susceptible . </s>
<s> The application of herbicide would kill off the male-fertile plants , leaving a large field of male-sterile plants that can be cross-pollinated to produce hybrid seed . </s>
<s> Mr. Leemans said the hybrid rapeseeds created with this genetic engineering yield 15 % to 30 % more output than the commercial strains used currently . </s>
<s> `` This technique is applicable to a wide variety of crops , '' he said , and added that some modifications may be necessary to accommodate the peculiarities of each type of crop . </s>
<s> He said the company is experimenting with the technique on alfalfa , and plans to include cotton and corn , among other crops . </s>
<s> He said that even though virtually all corn seeds currently planted are hybrids , the genetic approach will obviate the need for mechanical emasculation of anthers , which costs U.S. seed producers about $ 70 million annually . </s>
<s> In recent years , demand for hybrid seeds has spurred research at a number of chemical and biotechnology companies , including Monsanto Co. , Shell Oil Co. and Eli Lilly & Co . </s>
<s> One technique developed by some of these companies involves a chemical spray supposed to kill only a plant 's pollen . </s>
<s> But there have been problems with chemical sprays damaging plants ' female reproductive organs and concern for the toxicity of such chemical sprays to humans , animals and beneficial insects . </s>
<s> However , Paul Johanson , Monsanto 's director of plant sciences , said the company 's chemical spray overcomes these problems and is `` gentle on the female organ . '' </s>
<s> Biosource Genetics Corp. , Vacaville , Calif. , is developing a spray containing a gene that spreads from cell to cell and interferes with the genes that are responsible for producing pollen . </s>
<s> This gene , called `` gametocide , '' is carried into the plant by a virus that remains active for a few days . </s>
<s> Robert Erwin , president of Biosource , called Plant Genetic 's approach `` interesting '' and `` novel , '' and `` complementary rather than competitive . '' </s>
<s> `` There is a large market out there hungry for hybrid seeds , '' he said . </s>
<s> Mr. Robinson of Delta & Pine , the seed producer in Scott , Miss. , said Plant Genetic 's success in creating genetically engineered male steriles does n't automatically mean it would be simple to create hybrids in all crops . </s>
<s> That 's because pollination , while easy in corn because the carrier is wind , is more complex and involves insects as carriers in crops such as cotton . </s>
<s> `` It 's one thing to say you can sterilize , and another to then successfully pollinate the plant , '' he said . </s>
<s> Nevertheless , he said , he is negotiating with Plant Genetic to acquire the technology to try breeding hybrid cotton . </s>
