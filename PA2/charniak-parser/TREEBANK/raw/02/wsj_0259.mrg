<s> Another fight is brewing between Congress and the Bush administration over how to pay for the savings-and-loan bailout without adding to the federal budget deficit . </s>
<s> In a hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee , the General Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget Office , which both are arms of Congress , advised the new S&L bailout agency to abandon plans to raise temporary working capital through debt issued from an agency that would n't be counted on the federal budget . </s>
<s> Officials of the Resolution Trust Corp. have said privately that such a plan was the most likely alternative to raise short-term cash for the bailout . </s>
<s> Instead , the GAO and the Congressional Budget Office said , the RTC should consider using Treasury debt , which is less expensive and subject to oversight by Congress . </s>
<s> The spending could be exempted from meeting deficit-reduction targets in the Gramm-Rudman budget law . </s>
<s> The RTC has projected that it will require between $ 50 billion to $ 100 billion in temporary working capital . </s>
<s> The borrowing to raise these funds would be paid off as assets of sick thrifts are sold . </s>
<s> The new S&L law allows the RTC to issue notes for as much as 85 % of the value of the assets it holds . </s>
<s> But higher interest rates paid on off-budget debt could add billions to the bailout costs , and would n't be subject to congressional scrutiny , Ways and Means members argued . </s>
<s> `` To allow this massive level of unfettered federal borrowing without prior congressional approval would be irresponsible , '' said Rep. Fortney Stark -LRB- D. , Calif. -RRB- , who has introduced a bill to limit the RTC 's authority to issue debt . </s>
<s> The RTC will have to sell or merge hundreds of insolvent thrifts over the next three years . </s>
<s> The new S&L bailout law allows $ 50 billion to be spent to sell or merge sick S&Ls and their assets , but that is a net cost . </s>
<s> In the meantime , the agency must raise cash to maintain assets , such as real estate , until they can be sold . </s>
<s> Then the short-term debt is paid off through the proceeds of selling the assets . </s>
<s> David Mullins , assistant secretary of the Treasury , said that the working capital is necessary to reduce the final costs of the bailout , by allowing the agency to sell savings and loans without their bad assets , then hold the assets until they can be sold under favorable conditions . </s>
<s> He said it has n't yet been determined how the RTC will raise the cash , but the administration does n't want it to be included on the federal budget , because it would `` distort '' the budget process by requiring either exemptions from Gramm-Rudman or big increases in the budget deficit . </s>
<s> But the worst possibility would be raising no working capital , he said . </s>
<s> `` If working capital financing is not provided , '' he said , `` the RTC may have to slow -LCB- S&L sales -RCB- or dump acquired assets through fire sales . </s>
