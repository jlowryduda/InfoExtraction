<h2>MALLET: A Machine Learning for Language Toolkit</h2>

<p>
MALLET is an integrated collection of Java code useful for statistical
natural language processing, document classification, clustering,
information extraction, and other machine learning applications to
text.  It is designed to be fast and highly scalable, having the
ability to efficiently handle millions of features and millions of
training instances.

<p>
It was written by <a href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum">Andrew
McCallum</a>, with contributions from several graduate students
and staff, at University of Massachusetts Amherst.

<p>
Its development was funded by DARPA and the Airforce Research
Laboratory (AFRL) under contract numbers F30602-00-2-0597 and
F30602-01-2-0566, and DARPA SPAWARSYSCEN-SD grant numbers
N66001-99-1-8912 and N66001-02-1-8903, and Advanced Research and
Development Activity (ARDA) under contract number MDA904-01-C-0984,
and the National Science Foundation under grant EIA-9983215.

<h3>About the toolkit</h3>

The toolkit provides facilities for:

<ul>
<li> Recursively descending directories, finding text and other data files.
<li> Quite arbitrary pipelines of text processing steps.
<li> Tokenizing a text file, according to arbitrary regular expressions.
<li> Including N-grams among the tokens.
<li> Creating real-valued feature vectors, and feature vector sequences.
<li> Mapping strings to integers and back again, very efficiently.
<li> Selecting features by information gain.
<li> Building and manipulating feature vectors.
<li> A	general	framework for optimization (based on "Numerical Recipes
in C").
<li> Several classification methods including naive Bayes, maximum
entropy, Winnow, Boosting, Bagging.
<li> Maximum entropy classifier training is highly efficient, making
use of Nocedal's "Limited-Memory BFGS", an efficient quasi-Newton
optimization technique.  It also handles arbitrary real-valued features.
<li> A general framework for finite state transducers.
<li> An implementation of Conditional Random Fields, also trained by
Limited-Memory BFGS.
<li> Writing models to disk.
<li> Performing test-train splits.
</ul>

<p>Although many portions of the toolkit are very stable and usable,
the toolkit as a whole is still in quite early stages of development.
There is unfortunately almost no documentation at this point; it will
come eventually.  In the mean time, there are good examples of	code
for front-end functionality in	directories named "examples", and in
source files named "TUI.java", ("Text User Interfaces", with
command-line callable "main" procedures).

<p>The toolkit is Open Source Software, and is released under the <a
href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/cpl.php">Common Public License</a>.

<h3>Obtaining the Source</h3>

<p> Source code for the library can be downloaded from <a
href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/mallet/src">this directory</a>
(sorry, first release not yet available, but will be soon).  Different
versions are indicated by eight digit sequences that indicate year,
month and day. Thus, the most recent version is the one with the
largest version number.

<p> MALLET requires Java 1.4 or higher.  On all systems of which we
      are aware with Java 1.4 and GNU Make, you should be able to
      compile the entire package by typing "make" in the root "mallet"
      directory.

<p>Unfortunately I do not have time to help all users with their
compilation and usage problems. Feel free to send me mail asking for
help, but please do not necessarily expect me to have time to
help. Most appreciated are bug reports accompanied by fixes.
